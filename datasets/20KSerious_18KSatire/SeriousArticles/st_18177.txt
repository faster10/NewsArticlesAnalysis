" This situation has taken a toll on me and my entire family , and it has been a distraction to my teammates and the Brewers organization . I am very grateful for the support I have received from players , ownership and the fans in Milwaukee and around the country . Finally , I wish to apologize to anyone I may have disappointed all of the baseball fans especially those in Milwaukee , the great Brewers organization , and my teammates . I am glad to have this matter behind me once and for all , and I cannot wait to get back to the game I love . "
