This is male bonding with a capital " B , " but comparisons with the reinvigorated 007 series only show how far behind " Die Hard " has fallen . A lengthy chase on the Moscow ring road throws entire fleets of Russian commuters under the proverbial bus , but still feels like an inferior copy of a similar sequence in " Skyfall , " while director John Moore ( " Max Payne " ) defaults to the ADD editing style that ' s only good for disguising how thinly imagined this show really is . Even a climactic showdown in Chernobyl , a potentially fascinating location for any movie , proves a damp squib . Moore gives us an abandoned industrial plant at night , and any radiation barely even registers as a factor ( the McClanes don ' t need hazmat suits they ' re indestructible ) .
