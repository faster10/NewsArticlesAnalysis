The prudishness about nude statues isn ' t limited to the Islamic world . Here ' s just a few other examples : In 2012 , a statue in Shanghai covered up two statues of a man and a woman after Internet users criticized them as pornographic . In 2005 , the mayor of Canadian city Penticton insisted on covering the genitalia of a newly installed nude statue with a metal plate ( even after the plate was taken off , persistent attempts to vandalize the statue ' s genitalia led to it being moved ) . In 1995 , Hong Kong , then still a British colony , covered up a statue of a life size nude man after a court declared the artwork obscene , outraging art lovers . " The emphasis is on the face , not the genitals , " a frustrated legislator told reporters at the time ( the decision was later reversed ) .
