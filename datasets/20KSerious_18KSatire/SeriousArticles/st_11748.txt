I will submit my questions in advance for pre approval by the campaigns . No questions will be asked about women , racial minorities or any other issue that might cast the Republican Party in an unfavorable light . There will be no questions about any candidate s past statements or actions , including but not limited to : bankruptcies , financial difficulties , missed votes and inconsistencies . Candidates will not be required to perform math or to provide supporting evidence for claims . Candidates will be seated in Barcaloungers . If candidates feel overheated , the moderator will fan them while they answer and provide them with their choice of lemon or cucumber ice water . I will begin each question with the phrase Mother , may I , and I will address candidates as Your Excellency , Your Eminence or another honorific approved by the campaigns .
