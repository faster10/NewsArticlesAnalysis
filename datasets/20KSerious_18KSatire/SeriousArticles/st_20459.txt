London A journalist at the News of the World , the UK newspaper that was closed by Rupert Murdoch last year , once said : " This is what we do . We go out and destroy people ' s lives . " The British press , combative and uncompromising , has been a feature of national life for many years . But now a high court judge , Lord Justice Leveson , has decided the government must intervene to ensure it behaves itself . Will this prove a watershed moment for tabloid newspapers ? Or will they revert to type ?
