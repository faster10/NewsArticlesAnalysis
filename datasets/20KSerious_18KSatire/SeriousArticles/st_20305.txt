All that being said , the Rose Bowl ' s chairman , Scott Jenkins , has been consistent in saying the " strong presumption " is his bowl will take the higher ranked team , period . If this were the BCS , I ' d have no doubt that the loser would fall below Ohio State , because that ' s how polls work . But the committee last year did not penalize teams as much as the BCS did for playing and losing an extra game . And the members will be well aware of the consequences of dropping Iowa below the Buckeyes . If it ' s a close loss , and if there are no playoff implications , I do think 12 1 Iowa may stay above 11 1 Ohio State given it would still have a better record . Michigan State , on the other hand , would be 11 2 . Even though they beat the Buckeyes , the Spartans would likely drop below them .
