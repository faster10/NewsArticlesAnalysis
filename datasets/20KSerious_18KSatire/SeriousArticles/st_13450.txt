I got more comfortable as the game went on , Romo said . I think what happened was , the combination of the situational thinking throughout the game and that got better and better as the game went on . Then my footwork got better and I got tighter with everything . I trusted what I was seeing . Sometimes I threw a little bit away or low and that was just because I wasn t 100 percent certain , and that comes from a layoff . I think as the game went on I started to find that rhythm and we started moving the ball pretty well .
