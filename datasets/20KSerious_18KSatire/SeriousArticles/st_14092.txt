Sanders said in his remarks that he will use Section 121 of the Dodd Frank Act to break up the largest banks . That section allows the Federal Reserve , with assent from the Financial Stability Oversight Council , to force a bank to sell assets and shrink in size if the lender is deemed to pose a " grave threat " to the nation ' s financial stability and less severe actions are inadequate to mitigate the threat . While the president has no direct control over the Fed , he or she can nominate new governors and appoint the chairman .
