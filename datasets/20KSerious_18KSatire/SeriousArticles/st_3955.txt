The article implies that he was directed by a small cabal of owners to extract revenge on the Patriots for their continuous success . But I believe that he went further . He went after Brady for the sin of being the face of the NFL rather than Goodell himself . He has everything that Goodell wants in terms of recognition but that Goodell can never ever receive . And that Narcissist behavior by Goodell is what makes him so evil . Goodell is using the power of his position to do what he can to diminish Brady s accomplishments and minimize his future potential . And what make it most sinister is that he hides behind the the veil of integrity when he doesn t have an ounce of it .
