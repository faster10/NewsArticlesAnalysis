I feel bad for Revis . As a pats fan he is probably one of the biggest reasons we won the super bowl but this year something seems off its almost like now that he knows his future is secure he isn t playing as hard as he did . He has been torched multiple times this year and the only bad game I can remember for Revis last year was the packers game where he gave up the huge touchdown but even that was one play the rest of the game he was lockdown . I m not just saying this because he is on the jets now but he looks like he lost his desire to win .
