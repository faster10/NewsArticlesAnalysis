In short , the senator from Texas might be very Right wing but he is also very smart . And he comes from a political tradition that is , itself , very clever . American conservatism has the heritage of Jefferson , Calhoun , Thoreau , Lincoln , Teddy Roosevelt , Buckley and Kirk . Its reputation for populism is arguably in spite of itself , because it has always prioritised the virtue of the rational citizen ? his rights protected by the Constitution ? above the whim of the mob . Trumpism departs from this tradition . Some American Right wingers have argued that its authoritarianism is , at heart , liberal ? noting that Trump used to vote Democrat . Others say that Cruz v Trump is a battle between conservatism as ideology and conservatism as identity ? for conservatism has become shorthand for white , working class anger .
