I appreciated all of your other suggestions for possible challenges as well . Many of you suggested I give money to help people in need and Priscilla and I fully intend to keep doing that through our philanthropic work . We ' ll have more to discuss there soon . Some of you suggested that I meet a new person every day . That was actually my challenge in 2013 . Others suggested I teach a class . I ' ve done that too , and I ' d love to do it again and get more involved in education in the coming year .
