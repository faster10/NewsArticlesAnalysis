Kelly ' s biggest mission could be to break down the broken Kaepernick , who was benched in November after an ineffective and injury addled 2015 season on a 49ers team that was decimated by player losses , and build him back up . Is it a guarantee Kaepernick will be back ? No , as perhaps Kelly ' s work with middling talents with the Eagles is proof that he doesn ' t need that kind of player . There ' s also the matter of Kaepernick needing to be built up physically , coming off three surgeries ( left knee , left shoulder , right thumb ) .
