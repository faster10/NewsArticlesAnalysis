The problem for Bush , however , isn t just that his performance last night was atrocious the problem is that his performance was ( and struck many elites , including his supporters as ) utterly and deeply revealing . The debate in Boulder presented itself as a fundamental test for Bush . What the night required of him , what everyone was watching for , was ? a demonstration ? that , despite the myriad troubles that have plagued him months , he could still be the guy : the candidate with the performance skills ? and the fortitude not just to survive but to thrive under pressure . That s what the GOP is understandably looking for in its standard bearer . That s what it takes to win the White House .
