It s debate night in America , folks . In just a few unmercifully short hours , the Republican candidates for the presidency will get together for one last opportunity to scare the living b jeezus out of Iowa residents before next week s caucus . In keeping with the larger theme of the 2016 race , the big story heading into the debate is Donald Trump : specifically , his decision not to participate as a protest against whatever Fox News did to insult his masculinity . But somewhat lost amid the incessant Trump coverage is the fact that the main debate stage will once again be graced by everyone s favorite hard luck Keebler Elf of a candidate : Kentucky Sen . Rand Paul .
