A few reminders at this ( very ) early stage in the game . For one , NFL personnel folks are still really early in their evaluations . Nobody has a draft board yet , and we still have postseason all star games , combine testing , medicals and individual workouts to get through . Drafting for need isn ' t a great idea in most cases GMs really do mean it most of the time when they say , " We took the best player available " and I ' m especially leery of making need the big issue here . Every team has at least a dozen roster moves to make ( and for some , twice that ) , and there ' s also free agency . " Need " isn ' t a clear term yet . Lastly , there could still be an underclassmen or two who decides to jump into the draft . That said , off we go .
