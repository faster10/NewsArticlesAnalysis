" But I ' m not even sure what it means to ' Buy American ' anymore , " says Reibel . " Ford has a huge stake in Mazda , and Japanese automakers build most of their cars for the American market right here in the U . S . , with American labor . It ' s easier to ' Buy American ' if you ' re purchasing a shirt or case of beer . But cars are different . I ' m sure if you disassembled a Chevrolet Malibu or a Ford Windstar you would find an appalling number of foreign made components and assemblies . "
