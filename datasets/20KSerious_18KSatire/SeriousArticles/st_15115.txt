There are not too many players who would share this opinion , but in Hewitt ' s mind , " the Davis Cup is as big as any Grand Slam . " That is a view partly colored by Hewitt ' s early success in the competition as he was still a teenager when he was part of the Australian team that won the salad bowl in 1999 . Four years later , Hewitt was a member of another victorious Australian team , with the most memorable match of that run coming in the semifinal against Switzerland , when he worked back from two sets down against Roger Federer . Hewitt would continue hustling for his country deep into 2015 , when the Davis Cup was his " massive passion " and his priority for the year , and Australia reached the semifinals , where they were beaten by Andy Murray ' s Great Britain . Now Hewitt can keep on grafting for the green and gold , in his new role as Davis Cup captain , with the first tie against the United States in March .
