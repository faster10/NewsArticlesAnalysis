The franchise ' s appeal seems to be growing in reverse ( we wrote a cover story on it ! ) , getting bigger with each film . The newest installment earned an " A " CinemaScore ( " A " from audiences under 25 ) with an almost even split between men and women ( 51 49 percent ) . Conventionally , that would indicate that " Fast 6 " will hold up better than the typical tent pole however , Fast Five also earned an " A " and good reviews while still dropping more than 60 percent in its second weekend . That said , it still wouldn ' t affect the success of the latest film so far : Fast Furious 6 has grossed 317 million globally against a 160 million budget . And in case you haven ' t heard : " Fast 7 " is coming soon .
