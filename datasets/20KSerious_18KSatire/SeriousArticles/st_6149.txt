Carolina turned the Seahawks most potent weapon ? quarterback Russell Wilson ? into a liability in the first half . Wilson s brilliant final seven games of the regular season coincided with better pass protection , which in turn led to fewer sacks . But the Panthers applied constant pressure on Wilson right from the start of the game . They hurried him and hit him . They rattled him . The Seahawks turnaround after a 2 4 start to the season was impressive . But they won last weekend s wild card game over the Minnesota Vikings only because of Blair Walsh ' s inexplicable missed short field goal . And the Panthers looked like an indomitable force in the first half ? and they would need just about all of those 31 first half points as the Seahawks created plenty of late game suspense .
