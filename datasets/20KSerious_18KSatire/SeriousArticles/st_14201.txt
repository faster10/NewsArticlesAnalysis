You know Eli is in the twilight of his career , you don t want to waste those years trying to get him comfortable with someone else , Riddick said . McAdoo could be the next Andy Reid . He could be that next superstar young coach who you can have around for 10 , 12 years , and that s really what the Giants are like . That s what they want to do , they re like the Steelers , those kind of franchises that exude stability . If you are going to take a chance on someone , take a chance on someone you know a lot about .
