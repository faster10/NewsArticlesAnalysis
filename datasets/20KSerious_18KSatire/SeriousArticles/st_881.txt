It was weird . I still look at the game cover and I ' m like , " Wow . " But it ' s kind of cool . Growing up a gamer and being able to work on the little things in this game like the different venues and those types of details has been a dream come true . The opportunities that I ' ve had to take the sport to a new level and change it and do things that people haven ' t seen before has been fun . And now having a game on Xbox Kinect , it ' s not every day a swimmer has that . It ' s just exciting and hopefully everybody out there can enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed the creative process of building it and playing it and making it and being a part of everything .
