The separatist force now numbers anywhere between 20 , 000 and 25 , 000 , half of whom are likely locals , with the other half composed of Russian volunteers and fighting groups from the North Caucasus , particularly Abkhazia , South Ossetia , and Chechnya . Many of the fighters from the Caucasus will go home for the winter if there is nothing for them to do in Ukraine . This suggests that the ideal time to use them in a bid to gain more territory is now , rather than trying to regroup these fighters next year for another season of conflict .
