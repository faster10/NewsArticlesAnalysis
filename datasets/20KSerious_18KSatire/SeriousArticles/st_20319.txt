We chose to activate Safety Check in Paris because we observed a lot of activity on Facebook as the events were unfolding . In the middle of a complex , uncertain situation affecting many people , Facebook became a place where people were sharing information and looking to understand the condition of their loved ones . We talked with our employees on the ground , who felt that there was still a need that we could fill . So we made the decision to try something we ' ve never done before : activating Safety Check for something other than a natural disaster . There has to be a first time for trying something new , even in complex and sensitive times , and for us that was Paris .
