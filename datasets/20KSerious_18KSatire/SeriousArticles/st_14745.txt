A concerned grandfather reported at a townhall meeting that his nine year old grand daughter was being sexually harassed on her way to school by Muslim immigrant children from the local refugee center . When asked what could be done , Muller outraged residents by incredulously advising they not provoke immigrants . He suggested girls take alternative routes and not wear provocative clothing .
