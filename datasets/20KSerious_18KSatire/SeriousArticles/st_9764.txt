The Light Surgeons have invented something they ' re calling " Live Cinema . " It ' s an on screen viusal performance , improvised live like a jazz band . It ' s similar to how VJs are working behind the scenes at a festival , anyway splicing clips together on the fly to match the ebb and flow of a DJ set . Here , they ' re in control of everything creating cinematic narratives ( like this " kaleidoscopic view of the cultural landscape of Malaysia " ) to tell grand stories . And they make killer videos for top DJs , too .
