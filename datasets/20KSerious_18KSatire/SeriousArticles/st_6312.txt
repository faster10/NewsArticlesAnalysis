This upcoming year ? I see at least six teams in that questionable category in Arizona , Arizona State , Cal , Colorado , Oregon State and Utah . That s a combination of tougher nonconference scheduling ( Arizona and Utah have BYU , Arizona State has Texas Tech in a must win big year for Kliff Kingsbury , Oregon State has Minnesota and Boise State , Cal has Texas ) as well as the fact that I think the teams that are better in the Pac 12 will make fewer missteps in 2016 than they did in 2015 . On top of that , most of those teams lost key players , which isn ' t what you want to hear when you ' re searching for six wins in arguably one of the toughest conferences in college football .
