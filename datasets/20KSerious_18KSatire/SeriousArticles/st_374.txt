These Trump supporters are devoted to him and deeply invested in his candidacy . They seem to view every attack on him as a diss to them . The focus group put together by Luntz was almost completely white , a reflection of Trump ' s base , but it included nine women , and all of the participants had some college or higher education . They worked in fields including government , education , law , sales and realty ? a little different from the stereotype ascribed to his supporters as downwardly mobile or non college educated .
