Maybe I m just biased because I like Trump and intend to vote for him . The thing that attracts me to him is what a wonderful mirror he is to how bad the other candidates are . It seems the best way to observe how flat and dead most politicians are is to put them in close proximity of someone who is alive . That doesn t mean I think he s always right I just think he s honest . Someone who is lying wouldn t say , They re rapists . And some , I assume , are good people when referring to Mexican immigrants .
