Regardless of who takes the snaps at quarterback , the Texans undisputed , No . 1 receiving option is DeAndre Nuk Hopkins ( 6 1 , 207 ) , a three year pro who has blossomed into a bonafide star . The Chiefs found this out in week one , when the 23 year old used a nine catch , 98 yard , two touchdown effort as a springboard to his first Pro Bowl season . Barring a surprise , Hopkins ? a vertical threat who caught two jump ball touchdowns over Pro Bowl rookie Marcus Peters in the first meeting ? should see the ball plenty on Saturday he ranks third in the league with 192 targets . Veteran Nate Washington ( 6 1 , 183 ) is a steady No . 2 receiver who caught six passes for 105 yards the first go round , while third round rookie Jaelen Strong ( 6 2 , 217 ) is a big target who still needs to polish his route running but has shed some weight and come on of late . He s built some chemistry with Hoyer during the two game stretch where the previous No . 3 receiver , Cecil Shorts III , has sat because of a hamstring injury . Shorts is expected back this weekend , given Hoyer another weapon . Tight ends Ryan Griffin ( 6 6 , 254 ) and C . J . Fiedorowicz ( 6 5 , 265 ) are adequate pass catchers who have caught a combined 37 passes this season .
