Appreciate the insight of the nurse above . It might be a bigger concern if TD was a young player , but he s already said next year is his last . That man didn t go through three ACL rehabs to sit on the sidelines in the Super Bowl . If he can get medical clearance , he ll absolutely play and he d play even if he was told it would end his career . His entire career had led up to this game . Even if he can t go full bore , I hope they can patch him up well enough to at least get him out there for some snaps . Maybe play him on obvious passing downs and try to limit his exposure to heavy contact stuffing the run .
