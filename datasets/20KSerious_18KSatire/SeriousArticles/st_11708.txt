Year one of the Jim Harbaugh era at Michigan was a raging success . The Wolverines went 10 3 under Twitter s favorite football coach . The rebuild that seemed like it might take a couple of years is way ahead of schedule . Michigan has no ceiling and it seems perfectly reasonable to think the Wolverines could be playing for a national title in Harbaugh s second season . Especially considering the massive talent drain at Ohio State . Don t underestimate Urban Meyer s Buckeyes . Where they go from here will be fascinating , too . But Harbaugh s team is the most interesting in the Big Ten .
