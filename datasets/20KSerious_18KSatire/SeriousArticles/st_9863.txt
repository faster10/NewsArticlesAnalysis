In the immediate wake of former head coach Jim Tomsula ' s firing , there were reports that Chip Kelly would quickly slide into the job . That did not happen . Last week , there were reports that Hue Jackson was the front runner and the 49ers were hoping to get it done over the weekend . That also did not happen , and Jackson is now the head coach of the Browns . Then there were reports that the 49ers requested a meeting with former Giants head coach Tom Coughlin , and that looked like it could come together quickly . But a Coughlin hiring also has not happened .
