" You never know how certain coaches would act with this opportunity , whether they felt like they were out there showing out for another job or auditioning or whatever and change their personality or their mannerisms just because they have the new platform , " ?

And we have faith in him to make those right calls , and we have to go out there and execute . It s been fun . "
