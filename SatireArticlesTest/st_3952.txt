And oddly , at least for a bunch of young radical types , my friend and his dorm mates cared a lot too . It was now their town after all . I would find the same excitement myself a few years later in New York City when Paul Castellano was gunned down in front of Sparks Steakhouse . In fact , they cared so much that they almost didn ' t come out with me when I decided it would be cool to cruise the city looking at all the grim faces . But of course after a black beauty or two , everyone was hot for action , so we went . And of course , nothing happened . The cops looked grim , the pedestrians looked grim , and even we tried to look grim too , which was hard to do with an anphetamine grin plastered on your face
