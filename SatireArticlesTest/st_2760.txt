Rep . Trey Gowdy ( R SC ) said he flat out does not trust the numbers . " Any right winger will tell you that you can ' t measure unemployment the same way with Obama , or any Democrat for that matter , " Gowdy said , " as you do with a Republican president . You have to do things like lump in literally every single human being alive , whether they ' re too young , too old , too sick , or too disabled to even hold a job , and then look at who ' s not working . " Gowdy said that once you " fundamentally shift " how the unemployment rate is measured by " changing the way it ' s been measured for decades " that , " You ' ll see the real unemployment rate is like 25 , and you have wonder , why aren ' t more toddlers working the fields ? Simple answer there liberal , anti freedom policies that insist that four year olds shouldn ' t work with farm equipment . "
