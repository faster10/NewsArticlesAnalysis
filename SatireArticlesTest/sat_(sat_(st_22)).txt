HC : I don ' t think you can properly destroy an economy without hyperinflation . Wiemar Germany . Post war Hungary . Zimbabwe . These were the worst economic meltdowns of all time , and all involved inflation rates of over 1000 . It ' s the nuclear bomb of economic warfare , and I can ' t wait to set one off . And personally , I think hyperinflation sounds like fun . It ' s exhilarating to walk into a store and have a new price every day . At my age being forced to do math just to buy milk helps keep the brain young .
