Twenty First Century news is all about viewpoint and demographics , not reporting . Today , we have to identify the political leanings of our news reporters and their stations a Rupert Murdoch station or paper like Fox or the New York Post is Right Wing , sensationalist and homophobic reporting for the redneck in all of us . The New York Times and Wall Street Journal are ( ahem ) Conservative and thus more ' dignified ' in their approach they appeal to the well heeled bigot and Capitalist . The LA Times or Washington Post are a little more middle of the road , which now only means you can ' t figure out which way they ' re leaning . MSNBC is the Leftist Fox even I won ' t watch them , and for the same reasons I ignore Fox . I want to make up my own mind , thank you very much . But most people don ' t any longer . It ' s too much work , all that thinking and parsing .
