You know I always wanted you to be proud of me , but no matter what I did , you always seemed disappointed in me . I don ' t know why . I really did my best . I didn ' t really want to be President , you know that . But Dad ' s friends didn ' t think Jeb was ready yet he " thought too much " was what they said , so they picked me . So it was their fault , I admit it . And I know you never liked Laura too much , but I did . Of course , she doesn ' t like me too much now , but we can get over that . I think . Just be nicer to her at Christmas and stuff and let her help in the kitchen . And she never " put something " in the stuffing like you accused her of doing . That was one of the twins and we yelled at them for it . It was their fault , I admit it .
