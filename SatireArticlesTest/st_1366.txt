Whereas healthcare providers were able to identify screaming , crying , cursing , and bone jarring explosions with tremendous clarity 100 of the time with the used white Styrofoam cup , those same healthcare providers struggled with the yellow piece of crap we somehow call a stethoscope .

The stained , coffee smelling Styrofoam cup also proved to be of a sturdier design , lasting longer than the silly jaundiced device in such conditions as a gentle breeze or someone coughing downstairs . Not surprisingly , the attending physician performed the best in auscultatory findings . Everyone else outperformed the intern .
