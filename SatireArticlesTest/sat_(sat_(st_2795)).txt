" This is a very large property , and there are a number of security issues at stake as well , " says independent contractor Paul Stanley , 35 , of Washington DC . " You ' d need to hire a crew that could pass stringent security tests , you ' d need to avoid limiting access to the building , and the Secret Service would restrict staff from certain areas , like the roof , without escort . All of that means it ' ll cost more money . And then you have the paint itself , which would need to be Earth friendly , otherwise it ' s all a moot point . If they can get this done for less than 2 . 4 million , I ' d be stunned . "
