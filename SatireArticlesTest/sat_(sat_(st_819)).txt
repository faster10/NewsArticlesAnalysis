" Although she lives alone , she still shops for eight kids , arriving home with a car full of groceries for hungry mouths that are no longer there . Every nook and cranny filled with boxes of cereal , cans of tomato soup , and loaves of expired bread . Three refrigerators occupy different rooms , packed with whole chickens and pork shoulders that will never see the inside of an oven . Cupboards overflow with onions and potatoes piled so high the doors no longer close . She went one potato too far . A neighbor found her crushed under a pile of Yukon Golds . She must have hit her head . "
