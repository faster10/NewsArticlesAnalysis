And this , Steinman asserts , solves more than a few mysteries . For instance , it has always been assumed that cars seen circling the lots at shopping malls were looking for a place to park . But Quantum Consumer Theory reveals that this is not the case . Instead , as malls are packed with consumers , they have strong commercial gravitational fields , meaning that cars circling the lot are actually in orbit around the mall , and only when that orbit reaches a critical point of decay will that car park and that consumer go inside . This also explains why people who don ' t intend to shop come home with packages they simply get too close to a commercial gravitation field and are sucked in and why many people of average size accidentally walk into Big and Tall shops they are drawn in by the sheer mass of the individuals in the store .
