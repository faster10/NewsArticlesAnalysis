Nuking Iran will be good for American business . Can you imagine the reconstruction and decontamination expenses ? Someone is going to have to put Iran back together and only American companies have the reach and capacity to take on a job like that . The reconstruction contracts that will be awarded to foreign subsidiaries of American companies will be worth billions maybe trillions . And oil prices ! That is where American companies will really make a killing . As world oil prices skyrocket the share price of American oil companies will soar . The jump in oil company share prices will also bring billions of dollars into our newly privatized Social Security system . Talk about good for America .
