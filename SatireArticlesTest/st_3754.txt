If they got sick or hurt , they all shared one set of legal documents from one of their friends who had become a legal immigrant but decided to go back home , so they had a Social Security card , drivers license and they ' d all use it to go to the hospital . We ' d laugh about the fact that poor Pedro Nunez had had his appendix removed twice , three broken legs and two broken arms , multiple cuts and bruises , the flu , pneumonia , bronchitis a dozen times and God knows what else . Don ' t misunderstand this , if they could ' ve they would have paid their way , but given their status , they were forced to lie . Believe me , it ' s no fun to live this way and you don ' t do it out of choice .
