" This is how they get you . It ' s that boiled frog thing , " Richard Dabney of Billings , Montana in a Facebook discussion . " None of us guys are going to notice they did this , except for when our wives start complaining . Then maybe they ' ll ban something else that we will notice , but nothing important like beer or NFL Sunday Ticket , and we ' ll still not speak up . Then we ' re going to turn on Facebook one day and find out Obama has outlawed gun ownership . Then who is going to speak up for our 2A rights ? It ' ll be too late and the libs will have taken over completely . "
