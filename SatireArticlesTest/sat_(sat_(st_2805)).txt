Rep . Thompaulsen told our reporter that " real American patriots find their magical bootstraps and yank those puppies till their arms fall off " instead of " filling out a form , waiting a couple weeks , and getting issued a pittance in an effort to keep themselves or their loved ones from starving .

"
