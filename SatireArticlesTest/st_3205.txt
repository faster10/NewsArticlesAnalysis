And I know Manti loved me . No , he didn ' t come to the fictional hospital when I was not actually dying of leukemia , but I didn ' t want him to see me like that . I wanted him to remember me as the young , healthy coed we pretended I was when we first never actually met in person at Stanford like he for some reason always told people we did . I wanted him to remember me as the lively , beautiful person I was when we went on vacation together in Hawaii like his own father publicly said I did several times .
