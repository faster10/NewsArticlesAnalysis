Priebus was addressing some criticism that the GOP ' s candidates have gotten for their reactions to the horrific tragedy that unfolded in Paris , France last week . The reactions from Republican candidates mostly dealt with criticizing President Barack Obama for not specifically calling the attacks an act of " Islamist terrorism " and most of them called for closing the country ' s borders , especially to any Syrian refugees that states and local municipalities may have decided to bring in before the deadly attacks in France . Many critics of the Republicans ' rhetoric have pointed to the fact that there are millions and millions more peaceful , moderate , non violent people of the Islamic faith than there are those who carry out terror attacks .
