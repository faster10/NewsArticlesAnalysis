( Tokyo Japan ) Beleaguered auto manufacturer Toyota may be in store for consumer lawsuits based on loss of value after Kelley Blue Book , a leading used car value service , lowered its estimated resale prices for the recalled models by 2 . 5 to 3 . 5 . The resulting loss of resale value could be as high as six to eight billion dollars . The auto manufacturer commented by saying that traditionally the recalled models have retained their resale value and they see no reason that this would not hold true in the future . Further , the company is committed to assisting owners of these vehicles to maintain their resale value with new slogans : " Nothing can stop a Prius literally " and " Lexus breaks through the glass ceiling and glass windows too . "
