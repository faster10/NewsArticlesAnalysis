President elect Barack Obama insists that the more the government spends , the more efficient the government will be . He also said that the way to make all of these government buildings efficient is not to shut the power off and liquidate them by selling them to the productive free market , but to spend trillions of dollars on unprofitable , and thus inefficient , solar energy systems . According to President elect Barack Obama , he recently invented a new form of solar energy that isn ' t inefficient . And he likes the idea of turning efficient food into inefficient fuel , which also will somehow make everything more efficient .
