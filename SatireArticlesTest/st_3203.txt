Go ahead , laugh if you want , but it takes a lot of trust to believe in our love despite all the obstacles , like the fact that we never saw each other , that no one , including Manti , ever spoke to me or my family , that there is no record anywhere of my existence . Yet despite all those impediments barriers that would have destroyed most relationships he still loved me . So of course I loved him . How can you not love a guy who loves you no matter what ? And in my case , I mean no matter what . Nothing could stand in our way , including my nothingness .
