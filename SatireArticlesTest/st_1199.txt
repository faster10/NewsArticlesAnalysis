It was close there for a few months at the office I had to move into a van in our parking lot to save on rent . Which is an upgrade over Berger ' s van down by the river . But , things are picking up and we hope to soon hire back our receptionist and nurses . In about five years , I think we ' ll have saved enough to pay off our EMR system . "
