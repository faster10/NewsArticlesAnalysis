" I have a wife and a two year old little girl and now I ' m unemployed Fired from the career I have cherished for the past eight years . I ' ve been blessed with family and friends who have offered me odd jobs here and there , but the financial strain is undeniable . I ' m going to continue spreading the word about Jack Phillips and his shady business practices . I may never get my job back , but helping a future employee avoid the same fate is something I absolutely must do . "
