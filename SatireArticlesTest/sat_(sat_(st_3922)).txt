Look , let ' s be frank here you put a bunch of sexually frustrated guys in loose fitting long gowns together with a bunch of alter and choir boys also wearing pretty gowns , add a little Sacrificial Wine and the potential of forgiveness from the confessional by other priests in long gowns and things are bound to happen . And let ' s face it , if God didn ' t want it to happen , it wouldn ' t have . After all , He does work in Mysterious Ways , and while these instance of the Priestly boinging of boys are perhaps a little more mysterious than some others I could mention , we must assume as a Matter of Faith that the physical and emotional destruction of these young boy ' s lives are part of His Plan . As your Holy Father , not to mention His chief go to guy on Earth , I ' ve actually spoken to Him once or twice about it . His response was something along the lines of , " Dude , what did you expect ? " I have taken this to mean that He was both aware of the issue and wasn ' t too concerned about it , so you shouldn ' t be either .
