It ' s in these types of venues that Sarah is in her element . As a former TV sportscaster , just give her a mike and a teleprompter and off she goes . Just don ' t ask her any unscripted questions . That ' s not her style . She said so in the debates " I may not answer the questions that either the moderator or you want to hear " and while that might make her a bit hard to pin down on the policy side of an issue , it does make for a fun time at old campaign rally .
