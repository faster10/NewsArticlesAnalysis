And finally , to all you guys who insist on using your houses as band rehearsal spaces : you ' re not very good and listening you play at 100Db at two in the morning is annoying . Real students , the ones that came here to learn , are trying to sleep or study . Give em a break and cut your guitar strings , use your drum sticks for kindling and shut up till you ' re a better player . Please , we ' re begging you . ( Yes , K , this means you . )
