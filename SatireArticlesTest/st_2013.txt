" If I had it to do all over again , " explained Davis , " I would have married my fourth husband first and be done with it . Once I became a true Christian and was guided into a stable and traditional relationship which the Lord once again ordained , my purpose transformed into protecting those who I am now charged to serve . I am sparing those who appear before me , the years of suffering that I am all too familiar with , and when they see the light just as I have , they will thank me three fold , as each of my ex husbands has .
