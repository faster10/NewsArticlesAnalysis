On Wednesday , Priebus watched his party ' s most recent primary debate on CNBC , and he was not pleased with what he saw . " While I was proud of our candidates and the way they handled tonight ' s debate , the performance by the CNBC moderators was extremely disappointing and did a disservice to their network , " Priebus said in a statement about the debates . Things went from bad to worse for Priebus though , when he got a call shortly after the debate from the Turd Polisher in his town to come and pick up the batch of turds he ' d left for polishing the night before .
