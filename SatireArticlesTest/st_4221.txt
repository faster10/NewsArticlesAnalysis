Hiding behind an " everyman is us wave the flag " propaganda campaign , Republicans use a mixture of fear , nationalistic jingoism , and " you can get rich too " emotionalism to tilt power and money to those who already control a large part of the nation ' s wealth , making the rich richer and the poor poorer . Thanks to the Republicans and their " the president can do no wrong " agenda , the US is faced with a war that it can ' t win and has already lost in terms of worldwide prestige and public opinion .
