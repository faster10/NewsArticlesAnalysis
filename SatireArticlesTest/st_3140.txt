A follow up to Megan ' s Law , enacted by New Jersey in 1994 , the so called " Egan ' s Law " is named for Cardinal Edward Egan of New York and Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston , who are both accused of covering up sexual abuse by priests under their authority . Like Megan ' s Law , Egan ' s Law is expected to spread quickly to other states , but for parents in towns across New Jersey , it ' s on the books none too soon .
