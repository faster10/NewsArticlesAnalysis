Of course , all our news isn ' t joyous poor Uncle Spike is no longer with us . He started to sample his own product ( always a mistake ! ) and took to wandering the streets of town waving a pistol around and screaming the Feds were after him . Ironically , the Feds really were after him , that is until he was found in the long term parking lot of Newark Airport , the apparent victim of suicide . While the Authorities have yet to explain how Spike was able to shoot himself in the back of the head through a closed car window the ruling on the cause of death did provide the family with some closure .
