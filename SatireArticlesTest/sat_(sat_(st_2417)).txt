When reached for comment , Dolezal unabashedly admitted to the ongoing racial ruse . " I take my work seriously . Did I take my black woman character a shade too far ? Some say yes , but I disagree . I mean , are folks coming down this hard on Flo from Progressive Insurance ? That character has got to be an improv gone way too far , but no one ' s up in arms over her ! How many commercials she got anyway twenty ? A hundred twenty ? "
