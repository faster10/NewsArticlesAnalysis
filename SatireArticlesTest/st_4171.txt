Now remember that the money is booze . What happened was that Greenspan was essentially getting his relatives , the banks and mortgage lenders , drunk on money . Those guys , once they were really oiled up , started passing out blue light money at well drink prices to little guys who weren ' t in the family , never stopping to see if we , the little budding alcoholics at the bottom of the ladder , were drinking responsibly or not . See , by that time they were just as drunk as we were , they weren ' t thinking clearly and the liquor was easy to get . .
