Yes , it puts local White businesses at a disadvantage . But ask any hardware store if Lowes or Home Depot puts them at a disadvantage , sales tax or no . Or WalMart or Sam ' s Clubs . For that matter , ask any American manufacturer , farmer or supplier of goods from autos to oranges if overseas seller ' s put them at a disadvantage . Like it or not , that ' s the way capitalism works . Now , add to this the several centuries of Whites regularly screwing Native Americans out of pretty much whatever they felt like , from their land to their language and traditions to their very lives . Were we as Americans all that concerned about the disadvantages , economic or otherwise that we put Native Americans at ? Not really it was easier to sell reproductions of paintings and bronze statues mourning the " Vanishing Noble Savage " than it was to give them schools where they could teach their children their own languages and traditions along with math and science , give them their lands back , or even just pay them a fair wage for their work .
