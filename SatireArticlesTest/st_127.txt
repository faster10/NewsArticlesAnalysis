" He kicked our front door open and started threatening us with a gun " says Margarita Sanchez , one of the victims . " He was asking for money , and we tried to explain to him that we didn ' t have any . I had never been so scared in my life , I thought I was going to die . Then all of a sudden , there was blood everywhere , a hole in the ceiling and the guy was dead . We didn ' t understand what had happened until hours later , when the cops explained it to us . The strangest part is that he saved my life , because the meteorite went right through the couch where I usually sit to watch TV . "
