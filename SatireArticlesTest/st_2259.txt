What will the president ' s next invention be ? No one can be sure , but one senior aide we spoke with says it might involve the microbrewery Obama had installed in the White House . " he spends a lot of time in there , tinkering with the equipment , " the aide claims . " We all have guesses as to what he might be doing down there . I think he ' s trying to make the perfect beer . Others think he is trying to make a high quality microbrewery the size of a typical coffee machine , that can make beer instantly , on the go . But we ' re all just speculating . "
