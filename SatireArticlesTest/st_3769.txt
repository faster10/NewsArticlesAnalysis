" Many have suggested that from the perspective of the home front , this doesn ' t really look like a war at all , " stated Snow . " This war was designed and planned this way intentionally so as to have the least amount of impact and discomfort as possible on the average citizen . We now realize that this may have been a slight mistake . In an effort to correct this problem of misperception , the administration is re examining the possibility of rescinding its policy on the viewing of flag draped coffins . We will be promoting a commemorative gas ration coupon , with the proceeds to go towards care for wounded veterans . The US Department of Agriculture will begin selling commemorative " Victory Garden " seed packs to help Americans show their support for the troops . "
