" These games are fun , but usually a breeze even on harder difficulties , " shrugged veteran gamer Brian Teaworth . " Not true for AC : MICU . On this one mission , I had a 92 year old templar who was DNR DNI . She had a massive subdural hematoma but was doing alright and getting close to discharge back to Sunset Hills . " ' I knew I had to act fast . I consulted neurosurgery who convinced her children to do a massive craniotomy ! She survived the massive whack but ain ' t coming off that vent any time soon . It ' s long missions like this one that keep me coming back to this great game . "
