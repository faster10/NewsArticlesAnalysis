North Pole ( UPSI ) In an exclusivity interview with UPSI , Kris Kringle , better known as Santa Claus , revealed that the recent acceleration of the melting of the polar ice cap has had a devastating effect on his ability to come through with Christmas this year . Kringle stated that his workshops , as well as housing facilities for his work staff , were literally destroyed within a matter of months this summer . Many have fled , and those who have elected to stay on have had to work and live in suboptimal conditions on a loosely associated band of shrinking icebergs .
