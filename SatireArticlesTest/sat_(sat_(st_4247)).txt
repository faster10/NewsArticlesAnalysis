Mr Bush , speaking to the assembled party faithful said , " Remember , all those smelly old people will be dead soon at the end of the day does it really matter if they died rich or poor ? Of course not in a hundred years no one will even remember their names . Instead of worrying about some old people who ' ll be worm food in a year or two we have to look at what ' s important , and what ' s important is money . Your money , my money , money in general . You all should be as rich as I am cause the richer you get then the richer I ' ll be . So I say when it comes to wealth , ' Bring It On ' until we can say , ' Mission Accomplished ' ! " President Bush apparently feels The Dow , which has dropped 190 points this year and is down over 400 points since he took over the country in the 2000 coup is still a bully place to stash cash .
