I own a small business , but I ' m in the process of selling it off and moving to California . We ' re building a small organic farm and a new house . So , over a two or three years we ' ll be paying a couple of states and the Feds a bunch of capital gains taxes , building permit fees , etc . and buying tons of building materials and large appliances . In short , we ' re contributing to the system big time .
