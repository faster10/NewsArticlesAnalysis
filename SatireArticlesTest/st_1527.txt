Mrs Quinn arrived home from work a week after their return to find a horrific scene awaiting her . " When I got home from work and opened the door to our flat , I could not believe what I saw , and what happened . Buddy had killed our two cats , Marley and Jimi . Buddy was in the kitchen cowering , wild eyed in the corner sopping wet with blood . When he saw me he lunged forward . I barely made it out the door . " Shortly afterward the police were summoned . They shot buddy and his body was retrieved by a veterinary diagnostic team for necropsy where it was discovered that he had indeed been infected with the deadly rabies virus .
