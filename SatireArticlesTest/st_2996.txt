Richard M . , California : " I ' m an executive at work , but at home sometimes I like to be told what to do . For me , that means I ' m installing OS X Lion and I get to the license agreement page and the button says Accept ' and first I click Decline ' and the software says You must accept this agreement ' and I click Decline ' again and the screen says You Must Accept . " ' and I ' m like , Please no . " ' and it ' s like " Accept ! Accept . " and I click OK God yes I accept . " '
