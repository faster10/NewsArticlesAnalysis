A few days after the US pictures came out , the British political science journal , The Daily Mirror , published pictures that appeared to show a UK soldier using violence and urinating on a hooded Iraqi captive . However , the British military later concluded the truck shown in the picture had never been in Iraq , and items of uniforms and weaponry were also different from those used in Iraq . The Mirror later said it had printed the fake images in order to discredit authentic photos of torture and abuse turned in by a film shop worker who said she " felt sick " when she saw them . The Times article suggested a similarity with the forged document used to discredit critics of Bush ' s absentee military service . The editor of the Mirror was nevertheless sacked , and the journal apologized .
