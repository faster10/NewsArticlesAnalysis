In the company where I work , ' tomorrow ' is no longer a promise . It is as vague and unpredictable as a ' path to profitability ' or a ' viable business model . ' We do not know what will happen . Every day , as I walk the 100 yards to collect my car in the parking lot , I see the vultures as they circle our company , whisking away our best employees . Every day , I must hear the cries of my workers , who want to know , ' Will I have a job tomorrow ? ' ' Will my stock options ever come out from under the water ? ' I do not know what to tell them .
