We were able to catch up with Michael shortly after the event to gain some insight as to why he would subject his young teen daughter to such a harsh punishment . He told us the following : " Just because Billy Ray Cyrus lets his daughter act like a vulgar tramp does not mean it is acceptable for my daughter to behave in a similar fashion . Several people have accused me of abusing my daughter because of this , but I did what I did because I love my her and I want to discourage her from soliciting the wrong kinds of attention . If other parents stepped up to the plate and disciplined their kids it would save them a lot of grief down the road . "
