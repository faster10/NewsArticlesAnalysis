AC DC fits right into this scenario . For decades , AC DC have employed a " decibel over design " principle of blues based arrangement that mirrors the wasteland aspect of their Austrian origin . Their " music " is characterized by thick , hard driving rhythms , screeching vocals , and crazy solo guitar meanderings from a whittled down boy man who patterns himself after Animal from the Muppet Show . Add a healthy homage to Satan and hidden bisexual innuendo ( note their name , AC DC , get it ? ) in every record and you have the formula for one of the worst affronts to decency that ever took to the rock concert stage .
