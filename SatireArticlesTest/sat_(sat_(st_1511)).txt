Alabama , who shut down marriage licensing offices state wide following the declaration , has recently compared gay marriage to the Holocaust Chief Justice Roy Moore saying that he is expected to " follow the highest authority " and be " ordered to " , or forced to , uphold a law he does not agree with . Apparently it has not occurred to Moore that the Holocaust was about mass genocide and murder , and that gay marriage is about love though many Americans do synonymize marriage with death , same sex or not .
