Nurse O ' Donnell envisions a separate hospital wing for healthcare personnel only . " I see it as a sort of wellness center , " she explains . " It would start off with a large pool and water therapy . But over time , as nurses , nurse practitioners , physician assistants , doctors , social workers , everyone recovered and in turn provided better care , it would lead to better outcomes , better reimbursement . Then we could work on implementing other amazing therapies , like jacuzzis , massage therapists , and spa treatments . Yes , spa treatments ! "
