Called the Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005 , the bill passed the Senate and is being rushed through Congress to strip citizens of the right to a trial by jury if they are harmed by an experimental or licensed drug or vaccine during public health emergencies . The head of the Department of Health and Human Services will have the sole authority to judge whether pharmaceuticals violate safely laws and citizens get no day in court . A new secret agency will insure that no information about deaths , faulty drugs or injuries will ever become public .
