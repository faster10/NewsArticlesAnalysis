It has been revealed that 28 people within Orange County have had to euthanize their pets following exposure . DVM Daniel Yost recommended the following steps be taken in order to contain the outbreak . " Vaccinate your animals immediately . If they have had exposure to any other animals or dog parks , I would recommend a two week period of quarantine for observation . Unfortunately , infection can only be determined after necropsy which involves decapitation and analysis of the infected animal ' s brain tissue . Animals who have had zero exposure should remain isolated until the threat has passed and we have managed to identify , treat , and euthanize all infected animals . "
