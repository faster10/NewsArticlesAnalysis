It was with this confusing mindset that I agreed to eat at the local Mexican Restaurant in my town ' s downtown area . The parking at El Hacienda was treacherous to say the least . We were forced to negotiate a parking spot built for a Saturn or one of those electric cars , not the full sized sedan that we drove to the establishment . We made sure our valuables were brought in with us . I hinted that we should leave the car doors unlocked as area thieves would just as soon smash the windows to get at any visible goods of value in the vehicle . Best let the ruffians open the door to rummage through the car where nothing valuable can be found .
