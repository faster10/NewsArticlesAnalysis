Buying stuff on credit is the only way to get the things you need these days . Thanks to the fact that Republicans like me have fought to give companies the ability to suppress wages for decades , your dollars don ' t stretch nearly as far as your father ' s did , so you need to buy stuff with plastic . Of course , at some point you ' re going to run out of available credit and the interest rates we let these massive banks that have more money than God charge you will cripple you financially . So the real ballers know a trick to get the stuff you need without having to pay for it yourself use someone else ' s credit card .
