Hit snooze . Hit snooze again . Break alarm clock with fist . Sleep until last possible moment . Think about showering but don ' t . Wear same clothes as previous day . Mmmm , eating would be delicious , wouldn ' t it ? Skip it . No time . Exercise robust arsenal of curse words as you fight traffic on your way to work . Feel palpitations . Achieve peak levels of dread . Yawn so big jaw locks open . Park next to moron who doesn ' t know how to park .
