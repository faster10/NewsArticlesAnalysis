If someone calls you a white cloud , you respond by saying , " Shhh , don ' t jinx me . " But you ' ll never be jinxed that is the nature of being a white cloud . However , if someone calls you a black cloud , you ' re a black cloud for eternity . Trouble will always find you . The sickest of the sick will always find you . And even if you ' re lucky enough to have a few white cloud nights , don ' t be fooled : you will forever be a black cloud .
