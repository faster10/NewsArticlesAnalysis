We were able to track down the first awardee , Eric Johnson in his fourth year of medical school . He was practicing tai chi on the campus lawn . " Oh , yeah , I guess I was the first , " replied Johnson when questioned about the honor . Of note , he managed to maintain his body ' s impressively off balanced position throughout the interview . " Lots of third years ask me what I did to earn it , but I ' m still not really sure . I was sort of confused throughout that rotation . " Johnson matched into a physical medicine and rehabilitation residency only weeks ago and states that after consultation with the medical school counselor , he did not include the award on his residency application .
