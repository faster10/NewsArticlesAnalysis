Palast continues , " Russell Pearce , a Republican legislator from Arizona , who said five million illegal aliens crossed the border to vote for Democrats five million . I asked this fruitcake to give me five names . I said , " If they voted , that means that you have their names . You have their registrations . So why aren ' t you arresting them ? " And that ' s when I began to smell the Rove plan . He said , " Oh , the U . S . attorneys are going to arrest them . " But there was not one case brought in New Mexico by the honest attorney . Not one case where there ' s an honest U . S . attorney . And by the way , they did find about a half dozen illegal aliens who had registered to vote in Arizona . They were registered by the Republican Party . "
