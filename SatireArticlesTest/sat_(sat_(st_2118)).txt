Our car was safe and unharmed and we made our way home . We discussed the adventurous evening . The great melting pot sentiment of America notwithstanding , I didn ' t have the most noble feelings for cultural diversity . The concluding thought has to be that nobility is not necessarily defined by conscience lifting excursions of the sort that compels one to attempt foreign culture sampling and urban exploration , but one of the tolerances that is shown by an older white American such as I in the quest to coexist in a society with tremendous diversities . The fact that I didn ' t stand up and scream in the middle of the restaurant is a direct testimony to my tolerance .
