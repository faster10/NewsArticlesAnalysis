90 year old Fort Lauderdale resident and World War II veteran Arnold Abbott , who was cited for a second time on Wednesday for intentionally feeding the homeless , can understand the Mayor ' s frustration better than anyone , but finds humor in the circumstances . " The attack on the Mayor was senseless , and I ' ll pray for him , " Abbott says . " I think our Lord might be trying to send the Mayor a message , though . Laughs If he won ' t feed the homeless with bread , the Lord will find other ways . "
