Despite working longer hours , often at lower pay , without vacation or medical insurance , Americans mimic the wealthy by going ever deeper in debt . Since 2001 , they cashed out 480 billion in home equity , two and a half times more than they cashed out from 1993 to 2000 . Americans now owe 766 billion in home equity loans , 74 percent increased the years on their mortgages and now owe 45 percent of the value of their homes , up from 32 percent in 1973 . Financial experts contend these higher mortgage debts will make families less able to weather financial shocks and will drastically curtail retirement spending .
