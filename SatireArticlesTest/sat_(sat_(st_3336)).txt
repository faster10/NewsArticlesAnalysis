" We though this is going to be the biggest fight in Iraq . " Said Lieutenant Colonel Jim Rainey , of the Seventh Cavalry regiment . " But we were wrong . The intelligence was all wrong . The CIA was wrong . The NSA was wrong . The British MI5 was wrong . Only the Neo Cons who stand bravely back in Washington D . C . based think tanks had it right . I sure am glad there is somebody back home who knows what is going on here and I ' m real glad that they have the Presidents ear . "
