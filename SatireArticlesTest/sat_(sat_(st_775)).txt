Percussion can help differentiate between gas , solids , and liquids . Rather than using my own fingers to percuss , I prefer drumsticks and treat the abdomen like a snare drum . I would start simple with a 4 4 time signature and slow tempo , maybe 70 beats per minute ( adagio ) . As you percuss with greater skill , then and only then would I recommend moving on to more complex time signatures , fast tempos , and syncopation . Performing a solo abdominal exam prestissimo is difficult and should only be attempted with appropriate supervision .
