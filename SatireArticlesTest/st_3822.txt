My Dad and I didn ' t always get along well fathers and sons but I ' ll never forget the pride I had for him during those days . His lesson , although he never realized he was giving it to a scared little boy hiding outside his closed bedroom door , has stayed with me these last forty plus years : Do what you believe is right and honorable and if it gets you killed , then , well , it gets you killed , but you gotta believe in yourself .
