Just two days before notices are sent out , the officers gather , late at night , on the 50 yard line of Randall Stadium . Robed in purple , their feet bare and toenails painted alternately in the colors of anguish and elation , they stand in a solemn circle , each officer holding a list of with the names of 500 acceptable students 14 , 000 names in all . In the circle ' s center is a gigantic block of white cheddar cheese studded with kindling . The Dean of Admissions , dressed as school mascot Bucky the Badger , takes a red candle and lights the kindling . As the fire comes to life , the group begins to sing Pink Floyd ' s " Another Brick in the Wall . " After the last refrain , Dean Bucky shouts , " Teachers , leave them kids alone . " and the admissions officers throw their lists onto the fire . In moments , all the names are aflame and acheesed .
