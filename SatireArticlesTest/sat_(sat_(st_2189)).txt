Why is Nestl only returning 70 of the processed air , you ask ? Bulcke says the remaining 30 is a part of the deal his company reached with California . " The air we process , we ' re calling that Nestl Air , ' and every resident of Shasta County will soon be enjoying this revolutionary new product . But we wanted this to reach more people , too . So we ' re going to start bottling Nestl Air later this year , to be distributed nationally . Once people see the quality of our product , we ' re confident they won ' t want to get their air anyplace else . "
