I got up at four this morning after tossing and turning all night I couldn ' t sleep . Tomorrow , in just one more day , we ' re going to elect a new president , and while Bush ' s term runs till January 20 , it ' s effectively over on Wednesday morning . In forty eight hours or so , America might have taken it ' s greatest step towards repudiating the policies of the last eight years , or we may end up with the same exact thing . Like I say , I can ' t sleep .
