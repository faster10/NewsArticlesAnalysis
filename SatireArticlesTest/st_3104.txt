" Colin Powell told me that acting alone was not in our long term interests because , as he put it , ' No man is an island , ' " Bush recalled . " Of course , I pointed out that America is a nation , not a man , and that lots of nations are islands , so I didn ' t really ' get ' his argument . But I do like to say ' Colin Powell ' whenever I talk about foreign affairs because it makes me look diplomatic . "
