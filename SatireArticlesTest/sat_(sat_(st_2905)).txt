Look at it this way : if a doctor comes in and says , I can keep your grandmother alive , but it will be expensive and involve lots of procedures and new technologies and it may well be too late anyway , " ' who ' s going to say , Yeah , go for it ? ' OK , maybe Grandpa would , but he ' s not ready to let go , is he ? He ' s been with Grandma for so long so very , very long . But there comes a time , right ? I mean , she ' s 96 , for God ' s sake . Is she happy lying there like that ? No . She ' s not happy at all . In fact , Grandpa , she hasn ' t been really , truly happy since before you and your secretary took that " working weekend to New York in 1968 . You think Grandma didn ' t know about that ? Guess what ? She knew about that .
