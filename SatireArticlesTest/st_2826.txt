Charles wife , Susan Tullman , is in complete shock knowing they lost everything . Susan told the paper , " He told me on Monday what he did . I tried to get refunds on the tickets , but they wouldn ' t let me . How can the state let someone spend almost half a million dollars on lottery tickets ? He obviously had a problem and they knowingly let him do it . And the lady on the phone was very rude to me about it . "
