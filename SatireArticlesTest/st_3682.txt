Here ' s how I do it : I crawl out of bed just as the eastern sky develops the glow of dawn , stumble downstairs and let the stupid dogs out , then head to the coffee maker . I grab the bag of organically shade grown fair trade coffee from the freezer , empty the left over motor oil from the morning before and give the pot a quick rinse , add new tap water and toss some new coffee in a new filter and start to brew . Having never had coffee before I started to make it myself I had no idea how it was supposed to taste . My wife , being one small step from comatose in the mornings never actually tasted my coffee either , at least not consciously . Imagine my surprise when a friend of mine who once spent years living in Seattle came to visit . Seattle , as we all know is the Mecca for coffee and the home of Starbucks . She watched in horror as I slopped the pre ground coffee beans into the filter .
