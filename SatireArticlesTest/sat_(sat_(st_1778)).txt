Another fan , Tom Wilson , said he expected nothing less from Game of Thrones . " This show breaks your heart so hard . Nothing else on television can evoke so many emotions so quickly . I ' m not too manly to admit I cried when I saw it . But that ' s what makes this show some amazing , you know ? No one is safe . Someone is going to die every single episode , and it ' s going to sometimes be the people you care about the most . "
