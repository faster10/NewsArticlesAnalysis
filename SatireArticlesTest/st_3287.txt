But the year hasn ' t been all highlights for Eric . He missed out on attending Camp Wakabee this year , as he had to work to save money for college . He ' s gone to Wakabee every year since he was five , and I think it took a bit of a toll on him . We ' ve all noticed Eric has been a little nostalgic lately . He also now cannot pee while standing , because he has no penis . I caught him looking through some of his old photo albums recently , and I think he ' s already starting to miss high school .
