The Great Pacific garbage patch , also described as the Pacific trash vortex , is a gyre of " marine debris " particles located in the central North Pacific Ocean . In a 2001 study , researchers found concentrations of plastic particles at 334 , 721 pieces per square kilometer , with a mean mass of 5 , 114 grams per km2 . It formed gradually as a result of marine pollution gathered by oceanic currents . As material is captured in the currents , wind driven surface currents gradually move floating debris toward the center , trapping it in the region . The patch occupies a large and relatively stationary region of the North Pacific Ocean , bigger than the state of Texas .
