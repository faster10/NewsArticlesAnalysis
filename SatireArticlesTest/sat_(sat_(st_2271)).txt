" We don ' t need more voters unless those voters actually know who and what they ' re voting for , " says former FEC Deputy Director Mike Wallace . " An unhealthy percentage of American voters are either MSNBC or Fox News drones , who get all of their information ' from totally bias sources . A responsible voter could , for instance , name five things about President Obama ' s two terms that they approve of , and five things they disapprove of . Anyone who isn ' t capable of doing that , all while presenting factual information , would abuse their ballot and cause harm to this country . We ' d all be better off if they just stayed home . "
