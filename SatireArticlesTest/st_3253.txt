Some people have called my film projects a crusade . I ' ll leave this for others to decide . A crusade is the pursuit of social or political change , often by violent means . So yes , now that I think about it , yes , this is a crusade . You ' ve got to believe in something . I believe in going out of my way to stamp out the systematic oppression of male voices in cinema . Whether that ' s by making dozens of films in which the female characters only say , " I am stupid and ugly and men smell or by commenting on YouTube videos with " feminism kills men every single day , probably more than all the wars combined I ' m just doing my bit .
