David Kucinich , with his face filled with grief held up in his hand a large funeral wreath . And on it the names of the thousands of dead and there was real pain in the words that he said , " You ' ve started a War , but you ' ll stay alive . The same can ' t be said for all the children who ' ve died . All of their deaths now rest on your head and you ' ll see their faces when you ' re on your deathbed . "
