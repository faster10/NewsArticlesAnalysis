When we asked why he chose to cover his barn in wolf cadavers rather than disposing of them in a different fashion , he replied with the following " The way I see it , I ' m killing two birds with one stone . The corpses actually insulate the barn in the colder months . They also prevent wolves from sneaking into my property to kill any more of my livestock . I mean , think about it . Would you break into someones house if it was covered with the bodies of dead burglars who had been shot in the damn head ? Yeah , I didn ' t think so . "
