Tom DeLay : The Republican House Speaker has been forced to step down from that post as he is under indictment for fraud related to campaign finances Mr DeLay has also been accused of illegally soliciting campaign contributions , laundering campaign contributions to influence state legislative races and the improper use of his office to influence various federal agencies . Rebuked by a House Ethics Committee at the end of September 2004 for pressuring a fellow member of the House to switch his vote on a health care bill , Mr DeLay has also been subpoenaed to give information regarding his use of the Federal Aviation Administration to track down a plane owned by a rival Texas Democrat who fled the state rather than allow Mr DeLay to illegally change voting district boundaries to aid his fellow Republicans . None of this can possibly be true . Do you hear me ? None of it .
