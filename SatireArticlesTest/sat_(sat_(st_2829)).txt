Over the past several wars , the United States has become accustomed to fighting against their own weapons and older Soviet Union style weapons . In Afghanistan , US soldiers fought against AK 47s left over from when the Russian fought their several decades earlier . In Iraq , we faced American made weapons we had given Saddam Hussein to fight against Iran in the 1980s . Now in Syria and Iraq , we are fighting against ISIS troops armed with weapons from all the previous wars and now drones .
