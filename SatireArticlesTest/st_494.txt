" I was so embarrassed when he came home one night when Don and I were throwing a party with some friends , and all he was wearing was a shirt , tie , and loafers , " said the young right winger ' s mother , " but I know he ' s still young and highly emotional . He ' ll probably come around once he sees that everything that Republicans do is wrong , and he ' ll look back on this time of his life with a bit of a laugh . We all had fads in our lives where silly things just seemed so important , but in the end , we realized how meaningless they were , which I hope is how he someday sees his obsession to be rich and clean cut .
