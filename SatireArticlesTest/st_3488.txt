In an effort to foster religious tolerance , The Reverend Messiah refuses to capitalize the name Allah , which is petty , I think , as is calling Allah a " supposed " God . But here ' s the thing I do agree with : Radical Clerics , like Osama bin Laden and Pat Robertson ( and I think no one would dispute that Robertson is a Cleric , which just means that he is a member of the clergy , and he is pretty radical a man of God advocating political assassination is a pretty radical thing . ) are morons anyone who thinks offing world leaders because their President doesn ' t agree with their politics is pretty moronic .
