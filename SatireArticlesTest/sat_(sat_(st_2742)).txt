You get guys from Matzoh Town to do your money counting , and you get science guys from Chingchong Land to do your sciencey stuff . Anyway , they ' ve sworn up and down to me that if I give them , like , two trillion American taxpayer dollars , they ' ll get us time travel . And then guess what happens ? Bing bang boom , I stop Pearl Harbor , kill Hitler in his crib , and give this here Sports Almanac to young Donald Trump so he can make some well placed bets . "
