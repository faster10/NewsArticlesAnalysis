It is evident that health care practitioners have a plethora of new codes at their disposal , though none will ever be applicable .

Are you part of the Skywalker bloodline ? Is your right hand in tact ? What color is your lightsaber ? Why speak like Yoda do you ? How fast did you make the Kessel Run ? and Is Obi Wan Kenobi really your only hope ? and so on .
