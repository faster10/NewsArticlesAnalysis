" Whereas I usually fill up with premium at 2 . 79 a gallon , today I ' m switching to crappy ol ' 87 regular unleaded in memory of the poor Iraqi civilians and American troops who have died defending our right to drive , " said Brenda Pickford of Wheaton , IL . " I support the brave souls who are over there in harm ' s way , sacrificing everything they ' ve got so I can fuel my Ford Escort with the highest quality gasoline . In honor of the dead , and coincidentally in celebration of the Lenten season , I ' m going to lower myself to the likes of the peasantry and switch to regular gasoline . It ' s the least I can do .
