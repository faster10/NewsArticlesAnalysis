Those who have used OpenTable will be familiar with the layout and functionality of OpenBed . OpenBed connects patient and providers online but gives patients the freedom to see which hospitals , clinics , emergency rooms , or surgery suites have available beds based on city and location . Patients can make choices based on verified patient reviews , available services , and price range . Booking a bed is just as simple , and once booked , OpenBed will send reminder texts and emails . Signing up involves only an email account and password . The free app is available for download on all Apple and Android devices .
