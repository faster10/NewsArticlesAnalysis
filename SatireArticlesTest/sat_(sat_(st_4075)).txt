I took candy from a baby today . Yep , I did it . The kid was only 2 years old and he couldn ' t do a darn thing about . And do you know what ? I ' m going to do it again . But I ' m not going to stop at the candy , no sir . I ' m going to take that kids money away too . As a matter of fact I ' m going to take that kids money away from him every day until I die . But you want to know the best thing about this whole deal is ? You are taking that kids money too .
