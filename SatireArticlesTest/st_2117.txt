The waitress asked us if we require any drink refills or take home boxes . I declined . My wife had another Corona . My agitation was now worsened . 10 minutes and another alarming rush to the restroom later , we were ready to pay the bill and leave . We took the waitress up on the " to go " boxes as I had one taco left and my wife had half her burrito and side dishes unconsumed after reaching her fill . I was only too happy that a confrontational incident didn ' t occur . My wife seemed embarrassed at my agitation , but I could do nothing to quell it .
