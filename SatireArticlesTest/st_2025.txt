Parker can ' t quite say , but he does assume it " potentially has something to do with ( Dennis ) Rodman " . The former outlandish NBA player has a strange connection to the DPRK and their leader . " I don ' t know if Rodman used , but it ' s possible he mentioned something to Kim Jong Un in passing and that was all it took . Remember , his father was allegedly the most decorated athlete in the country , which is a complete joke . It ' s possible he is trying to look more imposing and athletic than his father an out of shape , troll of a man . Who really knows , though ? "
