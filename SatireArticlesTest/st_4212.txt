What it must be like to be a Republican these days . Not the stereo typical Evangelical Christian from Gaithersburg , Tennessee or Birmingham , Alabama , but your run of the mill middle of the road Republican that you ' ll find pretty much anywhere in the country . You know the type , fiscally conservative , somewhat socially tolerant if not exactly liberal , middle to upper middle class , concerned about keeping the money they make but not completely anti tax . Regular people who chose the Republican Party as generally representative of their beliefs . But the Republican Party these days , no matter what regular Republicans want to believe , has nothing to do with middle class , middle of the road , middle anything really .
