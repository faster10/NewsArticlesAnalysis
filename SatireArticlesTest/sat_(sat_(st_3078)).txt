For Arab Spring we saw that style vs . substance debate turned on its head . So serious ! So substantive ! People knew what they wanted and weren ' t afraid to wear it on their sleeves . Until someone started shooting at their sleeves . Arab Summer will have its own style , but it won ' t be comfy . I think it ' s a transitional period , like the early 1980s in America . You had the 60s and 70s where the fashion was wild and radical and all over the place . Nehru jackets and thigh boots ? The BeeGees and Jimi Hendrix ? Gag reflex ! That couldn ' t last , obviously . So then you had the conservative Reagan 80s . Very retro . Very hangover . Very Whoa , what did we just do ? '
