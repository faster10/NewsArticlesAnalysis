These are the alerts on my pager : Standard Alert , which is the perfect balance of loud , jarring , and irritating eight Pleasing Alerts , which is a lie as they are simply eight varied and slightly more annoying alerts than the Standard Alert and a Chirp Alert , which is what I imagine a hospital administrator would sound like if it were transformed into a metallic parrot . There is also a Silent Alert , which is actually just vibration mode . When a Silent Alert takes place and my pager is resting on a hard surface like a desktop , I often have to change my underwear and pants , as the earthquake level sound and shaking literally scares the crap out of me .
