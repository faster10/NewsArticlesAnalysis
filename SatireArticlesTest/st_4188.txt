But back to my 20 , 000 surgery . Since then , I ' ve been healthy , except for some minor injuries . If my wife and I had been paying an extra grand a year into the system since then for insurance , I ' d be halfway square on the bill by now . Better still , I would have never waited so long and the system would ' ve been ahead thirty grand the cost of the surgery plus my 10K in insurance payments . So from a cost benefit aspect , in this case health insurance would have made far more than it cost .
