" When Paul died , we all panicked ! " claims Ringo , obviously very emotional . " We didn ' t know what to do , and Brian Epstein , our manager , suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution . It was supposed to last only a week or two , but time went by and nobody seemed to notice , so we kept playing along . Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul . The only problem was that he couldn ' t get along with John , at all . "
