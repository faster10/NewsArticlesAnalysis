The Reality : President Obama did not immediately go on an apology tour . Instead , he first laid the groundwork , sending flowers from the Rose Garden and small candied hearts that said , 4give Me ? ' to no fewer than 60 nations the United States had either attacked , ignored , bullied , lied to , or , in the case of Spain , slept with once and forgot to call the next day . Even then , he could not visit without an invite . ( Ronald Reagan had tried that once , showing up unannounced in Beirut in 1983 with a fistful of violets and a box of chocolate jelly beans , only for Lebanon to tell Syria to tell Reagan it wasn ' t home . Embarrassing ! ) After sending the candied hearts , Obama convinced his friend , Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper , to intervene , a tactic that backfired in the case of Malaysia , which actually fell in love with Canada and the two have not been seen outside their Banff hotel room since late 2010 . In a last ditch attempt to reconcile with the world , the President posted a YouTube video in which the smooth toned Obama sang David Soul ' s 1976 hit , " Don ' t Give Up on Us Baby . " Quickly thereafter , the barriers melted , his phone calls were returned , and Obama boarded Air Force One for a two week , 16 nation make up sex tour the Secret Service dubbed , " GlobalBang ' 09 ' because the spellcheck on their iPhones refused to accept " Foreignication .
