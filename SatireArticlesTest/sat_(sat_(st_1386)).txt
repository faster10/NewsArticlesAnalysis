According to multiple sources , the unwieldy McCoy has always been careless when handling babies , dating back to medical school , family gatherings , and even childhood . " She dropped her dolls a lot , " said McCoy ' s mother Ramona . " When Leanna was born , we thought she had two left hands . " Rather than cradling , using both arms , or holding a baby close to her body , McCoy holds a baby ' s head in the palm of her hand with the rest of the baby ' s body lying up against her forearm as she runs wildly with her arms flailing about . Though McCoy is only 6 months into her intern year , she has already mishandled 98 babies , earning her a laundry list of nicknames from friends , colleagues , and parents , some of which include " Butterfingers , " " Humpty Dumpty , " " McKlutz , " " McClumsy , " and " ATM , " which stands for " All Thumbs McCoy .
