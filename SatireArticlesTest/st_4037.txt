Now , of course we ' d have to name the new holiday . I personally like the Solstice Wiccan ' s actually celebrate the Yule if I ' m not mistaken so the astronomically based Solstice Sales Days seems best , but I ' m open to suggestions here . Whatever we call it , it would be an unbridled and uncontested orgy of greed and avarice , with snow . And with Jesus out of the picture , Jews and Muslims can join right in with no guilt . Even Conservative Christians can jump in too and buy all sorts of Creationist propaganda , or Kansas School System Science Books as they call them , for all their little Evangelical boys and girls . Picture it a world where we all live together , joined by our shared love of Greed . Gimme a Piece on Earth , that ' s what I say .
