" The average Canadian Tire customer can expect a perfectly normal , completely satisfactory , single location experience when they visit our stores . Hold on , there seems to be a problem with this aisle . Everyone please stick close to me and ignore the warping of the walls . Everyone stay with me and keep moving forward . Remain calm and do not be afraid of the darkness . Please do not touch anything . Ignore the disco ball and the shining lights . Follow me around this corner . We ' re going to hear the sound of singing in a second . Please do NOT listen to the singing . Please everyone keep moving forward , it is going to get a lot warmer in a moment . " '
