" It was really cute , him trying to explain this weird musician terminology , " said Wagner . " The whole thing really didn ' t make a lot of sense to me , especially because he kept mispronouncing the Dave Matthews Band , calling it the Dave Brubeck Quartet . But still , I appreciate him trying to make me a part of his world . And I really can ' t wait for dinner at classy restaurant Green Zebra , I hear it ' s great . "
