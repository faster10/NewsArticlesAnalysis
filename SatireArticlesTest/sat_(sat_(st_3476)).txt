" I have an idea , darling , " I say sweetly , " why don ' t I drop you at the door , park and come in and meet you ? That way you ' ll hardly have to walk at all . " She likes that idea , being chauffeured and all . I pull around to the first row and edge past the traffic jam I mentioned earlier which by now has degraded into an all out street fight , with women swinging coupon arrangers wildly and spiking each other with their kids soccer balls . As my wife gets out there ' s a lull in the riot as all the combatants turn and stare at her , frankly envious of her car service treatment . I give a small shudder of sympathy for all those husbands who are bound to catch it when these women get home .
