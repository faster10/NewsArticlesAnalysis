" Board members were stumped as to what to do with this guy . People were saying : take away his TV show , make him eat his own toxic weight loss garbage , send him to jail , make him watch his own TV show junk , take away his medical license . And then I thought about that last one : he has a medical license ! That means fifteen hour days , carrying a pager , horrible EMR , ungrateful patients , insurance denials , Maintenance of Certification , patient satisfaction surveys , drug seeking patients , etc . What could be worse ? I floated the idea and the vote was unanimous . Someone suggested we also make him wear those crazy clown scrubs they have at the VA , but I thought that was over the top . Yeah this was like 30 minutes ago . Now what are we gonna do about this Dr Phil guy
