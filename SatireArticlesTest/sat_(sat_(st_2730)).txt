" There ' s nothing offensive about what I said " , responded Trump . " I remember calling people ' Oreos ' used to be offensive when it was about the blacks . I love the blacks . I ' ve always had a great relationship with the blacks . I said nothing wrong . I made a statement about how an American corporation showed its true colors and abandoned America . They ran across the border to Mexico . Can this ' Rachel Dolemite ' or whatever she is , can she tell me I ' m wrong ? Can she ? Who is she anyway ? She ' s probably a big loser . "
