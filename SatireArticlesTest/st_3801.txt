Mehlman ' s arrest comes on the heels of the arrest of Jake J . Brahm , a Wisconsin grocery store worker , who late this week admitted to authorities that he was responsible for the recent internet hoax of threatening to detonate radioactive dirty bombs in seven NFL stadiums . Brahm has maintained that his actions were the result of a bet with a friend . FBI and Justice Department officials refused to state if Mehlman might have been involved in the first hoax as well . Brahm currently faces the possibility of five years in prison and a 250 , 000 fine if convicted .
