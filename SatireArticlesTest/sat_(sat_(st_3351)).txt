Commanders at Fort Stewart , home of the 19 , 000 soldier 3rd Infantry Division , noticed troops had little nightlife nearby . Fort Stewart had one sports bar that shut down after the war began , and its bingo nights and Western theme dance club , decorated with John Wayne posters , did not exactly appeal to troops raised on video games and hip hop . Knowing booze and dance tunes wouldn ' t be enough , commanders also eased security restrictions at the post ' s front gate to encourage civilians namely women , who get free admission between 10 p . m . and midnight Fridays and Saturdays to party at Rocky ' s , which opened recently .
