Many in Washington feel that the outcome of the Libby trial represents a symbolic judgment over the Bush administration ' s making of the case for war in Iraq .

The president has since refused to comment , stating that the trial is ongoing , but has repeatedly assured the public that he has taken a personal hand into the issue of leaking at the White House .
