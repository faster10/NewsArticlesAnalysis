The ship left Sierra Leone on July 13 2014 in destination of the Mexican city of Tampico . Six days after leaving the port of Freetown , the captain of the ship reported in a radio communication that three of the crew members were beginning to show distressing symptoms that suggested they could be infected with ebola , and that the ship was changing course to head towards Cape Verde to get some medical help . This was the last time that the crew was heard of , and all 17 men on board are presumed to have died in only a few days later .
