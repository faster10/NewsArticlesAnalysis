Let ' s face it these are hard times for us all and it occurred to me that if Joe Barton , a man who ' s received 1 . 4 million from the oil and gas industry since 1990 , feels the need to give something back to his supporters , well , that ' s what elected officials are supposed to do represent their constituents . Then I got to thinking , hell , 1 . 4 mil . Is a lot of scratch and if I supported BP publicly , then maybe they would toss a little something my way too .
