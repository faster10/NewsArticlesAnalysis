" I think the numbers will be higher than ever , " says Steen , who also claims replacement actors have already been subbed in for 2 episodes last season and no one noticed ( he won ' t say which ones ) . " Then there ' s the curiosity factor , " adds Steen . " Die hards will be listening extra hard to spot the differences and offer their opinions all over Facebook , and of course to the Archer fansites . It ' s the last season , and some new actors will get some good exposure , so it ' s a ' win win ' for everyone , if you ask me . "
