Presidential candidates John McCain and Barack Obama met on Tuesday night for the second of three scheduled debates before the November elections this was a " town hall " style format and by all accounts , the type of venue Senator McCain excels at . Unfortunately , the physical appearance of both the candidates served to negate any advantage Mr McCain might have had in this format before either man spoke a word . At 6 feet tall and slim , Mr Obama stood a full five inches taller than John McCain injuries and age have added to this differential as Mr McCain is also stoop shouldered . It somewhat sadly put one in mind of the Kennedy Nixon debate in the 1960 election cycle a handsome , young , energetic man facing off with a worn old man .
