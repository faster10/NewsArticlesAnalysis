Dawson feels that the ballot measure has more chance of success now that the proponents can also argue the OLCC will be spread thin trying to regulate both alcohol sales and the sale of marijuana . As he explains , " Thanks to the passage of Measure 91 , this measure will likely see the existing state stores converted into marijuana stores that also may still sell liquor . The Act would also allow retailers like BevMo and Total Wine More to expand into Oregon as they were able to do in Washington a few years prior . I ' m just speculating , but I think the Governor is allegedly ready to endorse this change to bring in more out of state businesses into the state . "
