" We were shocked when he said yes , " states Tim Graham , the second year internal medicine resident who called in the consult . " Usually , when we consult ophthalmology , we are connected to an answering service and forced to leave a message . Then , an automated calling service returns our inquiry within 24 48 hours asking if we would still like a consult . If so , we provide a fax number so the consult form can be sent to us to fill out . Then the form has to be scanned in and emailed to the office secretary who informs the ophthalmologist of the pending consult within 7 10 days . "
