Mr Williams says Muslims in full dress are identifying themselves by their religion first and so makes that them suspect . Presumably he spends a lot of time in airports , so he must be nervous and suspicious a lot cause there ' s a lot of Muslims flying around . But I wonder whether Mr Williams gets as tense and shaky when he sees a priest or Hasidim ? After all , they identify themselves by their dress too . Or Rastafarians or Shikhs ? Or anyone with a Bible ? After all , Timothy McVeigh was a radical Christian terrorist . Priests have been caught diddling little boys and I ' ve known of Hasidim who move illegal diamonds and ecstasy from Antwerp . And I think , but of course can ' t be certain , that Rastafarians are involved with illegal drug use . Maybe Juan should just take a pill and try to relax .
