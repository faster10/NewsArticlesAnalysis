Carlson told the press that the Clark County Sheriff ' s Office will be receiving additional manpower and help from neighboring counties . According to Carlson , festival goers should expect 2015 to have the largest police presence in the festivals history . Additionally , while discussing police presence at this year ' s festival , Carlson said , " One thing that will be different about police presence this year , is the amount of undercover officers that will be onsite . According to Carlson , " undercover police officers will outnumber uniformed officers at a ratio of three to one this will hopefully prevent a lot of the drugs that festival goers sneak in from being distributed .
