The Times quoted Scott Silliman , one of the military defense attorneys in the My Lai prosecutions , as saying that his client ' s defense will be that he was carrying out the orders of his superiors and , in particular , the directions of military intelligence . He said , " Do you really think a group of Virginia hillbillies and some limies from Warwickshire a thousand miles apart spontaneously decided at the same time to photograph prisoners pretending to sodomize each other and send the film home to be developed ? " He claims that 5 or 6 , 000 pages of classified files in the annexes to his report show that military intelligence teams , which included CIA officers and linguists and interrogation specialists from private defense contractors , were the dominant force inside the military prisons .
