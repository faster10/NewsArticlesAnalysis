I do have a cousin coming to visit that is happening IRL . But she is really good with public transit , and she ' s staying with a friend of hers . They ' re going to a party tonight with people my wife and I don ' t know . My cousin ' s an extrovert . I ' m not an extrovert , I don ' t plan on becoming an extrovert , so why would I go to a party with a bunch of people I ' ve never met ? They could be the sweetest , most board gaming cinephiles in the Pacific Northwest , but it still wouldn ' t change the fact that I prefer to drink my own martinis .
