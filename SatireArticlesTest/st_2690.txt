" I heard Brady ' s a little deflated now , " said Craft , " but he ' ll perk up soon . It takes a while to recover , and ' Tom Terrific ' s ' only human you know . He ' ll be up and around , holding his own and bouncing back in no time with absolutely no stain on his reputation . He ' ll come out clean because he ' s an upright guy . "
