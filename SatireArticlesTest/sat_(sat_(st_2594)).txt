No one seems to know if this was an organized attempt to disrupt the election process or residual fallout from the tensions that erupted in Ferguson , Missouri back in August . " We take any forms of voter fraud or voter intimidation quite seriously , " said Daniel Farmer speaking on behalf of the Missouri Secretary of State ' s office . " We ' ve kept an eye on this case but left it up to local law enforcement to pursue . So far we haven ' t had any confirmed reports that these groups of individuals actually prevented anyone from casting their ballot today . It appears to just be ' all talk ' by these men and we have not seen any concrete proof that they were even actual gang members . "
