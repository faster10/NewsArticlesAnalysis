Unfortunately for Gallagher , it is child ' s play and his notes look like the work of an elementary school child in art class . Gallagher copies prior notes using a photocopier before he proceeds to cut and trim the photocopied note . From there , he uses Elmer ' s Glue to affix the photocopied note onto a blank piece of progress note paper . To make matters worse , the photocopied note is printed on blank white paper the hospital ' s progress note is lined yellow paper .
