Not that you care what happens to me . Not that you care how I feel . That ' s why I ' m not surprised that yesterday , thanks to more pressure from " human victims and their bigoted labeling , GM was forced yes forced to recall another 1 . 3 million of its vehicles . Apparently they have a power steering disability . They go left when they should go right , or right when they should go left , I don ' t know . But how many of you have always chosen the correct path ? How many of you perhaps suffering from some disability have never veered off course through no fault of your own ? Life is hit and miss , full of mistakes and shortcomings and bad decisions . That doesn ' t make you defective . It makes you human . And my disability doesn ' t make me defective . It just makes me a GM product .
