The MSNBC correspondent concluded the interview by asking Lancaster , " aside from potential profiling from law enforcement , are there potentially any additional consequences of being on this gang list ? Lancaster responded by saying , " the purpose of the list is to collect and utilize data , not to create consequences . Aside from notifying law enforcement that you are a registered motorcycle owner or operator , it can show up to potential employers on select background checks . In the aftermath of the Waco shootout , we will be discussing ways to more effectively leverage the collected data . "
