" I ' m a little close to the situation , evolution wise , so perhaps I ' m not objective , but I think Nietzsche was onto something when he said , and I ' ll paraphrase , that liberal institutions are the enemies of freedom . Liberal institutions do nothing to ensure freedom , if you consider the " freedom to live " as paramount . If you accept that , you realize that liberal institutions , the paladins of so called " equality , " do not ensure the healthy propagation of the species , but safeguard the propagation of the physically unfit . I ' ll cite an example : You made Gary Coleman an icon . We would have eaten him at birth .
