Smoke from all the pots clouded the thin Aspen air . Already brisk and biting in late October , the added drug fumes sent my allergies into high gear . I believe that every orifice of my being was expelling something noxious during the week plus ordeal . Whether it was the contact inhalation of dope smoke or the effects of organic food consumption , the nose was granted no favors during the time I was at the grounds . Will Allen even bat an eye when I bring this up in the weekly staff meeting with a plea for a medicinal per diem ? The truth is known to those that matter and there is no more to really say .
