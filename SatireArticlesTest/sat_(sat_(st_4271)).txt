In the war on drugs , Bush set several records . The U . S . occupation of Afghanistan has been a boon to drug dealers there who earned a record 2 . 2 billion in 2004 , and are expected to set a new record profit of 7 billion in 2005 . With the U . S . occupation , opium poppies are now grown in all 34 Afghan provinces , up from 18 in 1999 . Under Bush , poppy cultivation increased from 150 , 000 acres in 2003 to a record 510 , 000 acres in 2004 . These record drug harvests will invariably find their way into the U . S . for consumption in communities here .
