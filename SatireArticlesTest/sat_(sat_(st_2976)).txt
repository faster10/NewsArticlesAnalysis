" If you ' re walking around the park with your family and suddenly a giant mouse appears and tries to put its arms around your 4 year old daughter , I think a person can justifiably claim they feel threatened by that , " said Judge Garnett . " And at Disney , it ' s not just the mice . What about the 7 foot tall bear ? Or the sneering pirate with a hook ? Or worse , that pair of human sized chipmunks ? They ' re brown . That ' s automatically suspicious . "
