This study proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that patients in contact isolation might suffer in two different ways while in the hospital : one , from multidrug resistant disease and two , from providers using inadequate tools to identify loud blatant noises . Patient dedicated stethoscopes are faulty in their design ( they fall apart with exposure to air ) and functionality ( they diminish sound rather than amplify it ) . All healthcare providers and patients would benefit if cost saving useless pieces of plastic were replaced with better auscultatory devices such as Styrofoam cups , cupped hands , or two cans on opposite ends of a long piece of string . Finally , we can all improve our physical exam skills but wow , we really need to help out our poor , poor interns with their exam findings .
