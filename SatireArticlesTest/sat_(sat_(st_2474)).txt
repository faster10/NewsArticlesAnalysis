" Jane Smith " , who identified herself as John ' s sister , believes President Obama deliberately chose to implant her brother with an RFID chip because Smith is a conservative Republican . " He was set up , " said Jane . " Not every inmate gets the chip . I ' ve been studying it out . Some people think federal prisons are like Easy Street , but they ' re still jails . Obama wanted my brother tracked just to test out his little system . I ' m lucky John didn ' t end up in one of Obama ' s FEMA camps ! "
