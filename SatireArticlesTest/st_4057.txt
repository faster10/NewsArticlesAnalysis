I also never realized that in August of 2004 , Kalkot Mataskelekele was selected from 16 candidates as the new president of Vanuatu . Did you know he ' s his country ' s first president to hold a university degree ? Me neither . A year earlier , Boutokaan Te Koaua , was elected president of Kiribati . By the way , he was reelected in 2007 with 65 of the vote to challenger Nabuti Mwemwenikarawa ' s 33 , which presumably leaves 2 for Ralph Nader . I don ' t know if he ever went to college like Kalkot Mataskelekele did or not , but it doesn ' t seem to have affected him too much if he hadn ' t . Of course , my condolences go to Nabuti Mwemwenikarawa on his loss . Maybe next time , dude .
