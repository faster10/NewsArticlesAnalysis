It ' s the same throughout the movement Palin gets millions to talk about " regular Americans " her state gets back twice as much tax money as they pay and has some of the highest property and business taxes in America . So many Tea People gladly take Social Security and Medicare , Rand Paul gets half his paycheck from Medicare and yet they bitch about socialized medicine and big government . It ' s just so hypocritical , it makes me want shake the lot of em by the scruffs of their necks . Bad Tea People ! Bad !
