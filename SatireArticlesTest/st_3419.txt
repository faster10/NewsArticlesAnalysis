Meanwhile , in Washington , the White House appeared to be breathlessly anticipating the outcome of the Scooter Libby perjury trial . In a surprise move early this morning the jury sent a note to Judge Reggie Walton requesting to speak with Vice President Dick Cheney , who had been expected to testify . They also requested that Libby be placed in temporary custody over fears that he might become a flight risk prior to the conclusion of their deliberations . Walton admonished the jury over the request for the audience with the vice president stating that it was legally inappropriate , but granted the request for the detention of Libby .
