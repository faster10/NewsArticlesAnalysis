Some examples : Warren G . Harding ? A Recession in 1921 . Herbert Hoover ? The Great Depression . Eisenhower ? Recessions in 1953 and 57 . Nixon ? Stagflation 73 75 . Ronald Reagan ? Recession 1980 82 . George Bush I ? Recession two out of four years . Bush II ? Same thing , twice , including the one Obama ' s been stuck with . Actually , every major Recession or Depression since the end of the Civil War started under a Republican Administration and ended under a Democratic one . Tea Partiers hate it when you point that shit out to them . ( I know this because I stole this last paragraph from another article I wrote in 2008 and got so much negative feedback from that the moderator had to cut off all comments he ' s just as touchy as the Tea Party . )
