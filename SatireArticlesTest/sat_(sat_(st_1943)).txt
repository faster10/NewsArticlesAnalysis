" I ' m happy to finally be speaking with a major news outlet and getting this important information out there into the mainstream media . Chem trails are a very real threat that should be taken deadly serious . Awareness could be the difference between life and death . Don ' t you think that there should be a call to action ? At any given moment we could be wiped out with a few hundred thousand pounds of bio chemical dreck dispersed over our heads at the blink of an eye ! This is something we should all be talking about . It ' s something that needs to be addressed immediately . "
