( Albany NY ) Embattled New York Governor David Paterson is expected to announce that he won ' t seek reelection , but will remain as governor for the rest of the year . This is due to a " New York Times " story reporting that the governor may have intervened in a domestic assault case involving a top aide . Even though Paterson has asked the New York State Attorney General ' s Office to conduct an investigation into the matter , sentiment is against him by both his party and the press . Paterson ' s reversal to run came less than a week after his firm statement that he would run and win . A source close to Paterson revealed that he is in discussions with the Obama administration for a possible position . The Obama White House has had an eye on Paterson for some time since " we firmly commit to things and then change our minds all the time . "
