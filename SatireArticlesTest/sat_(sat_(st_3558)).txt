You know , while Republicans may be great at actually making money for themselves , they really suck at managing an economy . Warren G . Harding ? A Recession in 1921 . Herbert Hoover ? The Great Depression . Eisenhower ? Recessions in 1953 and 57 . Nixon ? Stagflation 73 75 . Ronald Reagan ? Recession 1980 82 . George Bush I ? Recession two out of four years . Bush II ? Same thing , twice . Actually , every major Recession or Depression since the end of the Civil War started under Republican Administrations and ended under Democratic ones . Weird .
