Pager related deaths are a sad reality of modern day medicine . There are numerous forms of pager related deaths , but all are ultimately tied to the malignant pager , whether it ' s in the form of cranial explosion , full body implosion , torsades , rectal bleeding , or physician failure to thrive . It ' s not uncommon for physicians on the brink of pager induced decompensation to turn off their pagers , walk away from their pagers , hurl them at the ground at breakneck speed , or melt them in microwaves or autoclaves , all in the name of self preservation .
