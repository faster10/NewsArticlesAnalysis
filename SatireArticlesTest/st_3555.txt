Whether this war was waged to distract the public from the Administrations intelligence failures that led to 9 11 , or the White House ' s desire to secure another base of operations in the Middle East in response to the growing antipathy by the Saudi Arabian people to American military installations in that country , or to secure not just Iraq ' s vast oil reserves but also to control the water supplies of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in the arid Middle East or something so elemental as the desire for revenge against a man who tried to assassinate the President ' s father is still a matter of conjecture . Maybe it ' s all of the above . What is certain is that barring some additional Administration slight of hand that will distract the American peoples growing concern about the war and it ' s costs , President Bush faces a long , hot summer .
