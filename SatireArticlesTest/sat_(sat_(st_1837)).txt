" You probably saw my recent arrest on the news . I ' m telling you , I can ' t catch a break , especially when it comes to women , " Zimmerman quipped during another portion of his set . " I think it really tells you something about America , you know ? I can punch a cop in the face and not go to jail . I can shoot and kill an unarmed black teenager and not go to jail . But argue with a white woman ? Handcuffs ! "
