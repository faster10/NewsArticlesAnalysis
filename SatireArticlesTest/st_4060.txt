You get an idea like , " Gay Marriage Should be Illegal " or " Pot Should Be Legalized And Taxed " or even , " Everyone Should Wear Red Underwear on Valentines Day " it doesn ' t matter what the idea is , as long as you can collect enough signatures on a petition to get it put on the November ballot for a vote . So in effect , any short term , hot button issue that captures the imagination of Californian ' s for a time can be put to a vote and be made a law no political debate , no reasoned discourse about the long term effects .
