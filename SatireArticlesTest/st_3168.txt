" When Emerson wrote Life ' s a journey , not a destination , " ' he was still alive , and what we realized was that all the people who tell you life is about the journey are still on that journey , so of course they ' re going to say that , " said Philosophy Prof . Anders Pehrson . " But it ' s the people at the end , who have reached the destination , who really have the sense of what life is about , and , by and large , they ' re not pleased . "
