Voter Daryl Fernandez echoes the SoS office ' s theory , " I was at the Bates County polling place and didn ' t feel threatened . Leave it to Butler to freak out and say they were gang bangers or trying to start some sort of riot . " Fernandez claims it was just paranoia that fueled the reports and nothing substantial , " Just a few homeless guys and then later some teens milling around on their lunch break . I don ' t see what the big problem was , the polling place was the high school gym . "
