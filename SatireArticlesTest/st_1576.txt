" even though this kid ' s parents told him not to swallow the gum because if he did swallow the gum it would stay there forever he swallowed the gum . ' Don ' t swallow the gum , ' they told him , but the kid must have had something wrong with his brain , because he went ahead and swallowed the gum . So his parents scolded him and said , ' What did we tell you NOT to do ? ' So then they bring him in . And there it was , right there in his stomach where it probably still is today , even after the brain surgery ! "
