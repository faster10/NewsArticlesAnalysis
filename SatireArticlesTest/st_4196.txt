We ' re on a knife edge . The Tea Party is looking to fundamentally shift not just the political spectrum , but America ' s entire moral code away from inclusiveness and the basic freedoms we ' ve all taken too much for granted . For the fifty plus years I ' ve been around I ' ve just assumed that a guy could be Jewish or Christian or Muslim or a Hari Krishna or whatever . I mean , who cares ? What do I care who someone loves or how they vote ? Hey , it ' s a free country ( remember when we used to say that ? You don ' t hear that much anymore . ) .
