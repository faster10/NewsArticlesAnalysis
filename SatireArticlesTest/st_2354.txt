During the weekend of July 18 20 , the Phish played the Deer Creek Pavilion at Chicago ' s Northerly Island , normally home of the Chicago Bears American Football team . Waves of psychedelic clad " phishheads " converged on the city , shutting down commerce and offending the good citizens of the fair city with their unbathed stench . Why the city council would allow such a heathen gang of violent ruffians to overtake their city goes beyond the conscience of decent folk but since the local government is made up of communists , it is well expected . This is what happens when decent folk do nothing .
