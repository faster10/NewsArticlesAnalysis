When told that his girlfriend ' s favorite song on the disc was " Love is Strange " by Mickey Sylvia , Peterson replied , " Yeah , I like that song too , mostly because of Martin Scorsese ' s use of it in Casino , but it was on there for contrast ! I mean , did she even listen to the next song the Velvet Underground ' s " White Light White Heat " ? How can you take ' Love is Strange ' seriously when it ' s being followed by screeching guitars and lyrics steeped in references to coke and heroin ? "
