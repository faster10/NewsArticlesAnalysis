" Last case I was really craving Stryker Trail mix but the patient had a peanut allergy , " Joe Rose , an Orthopedic surgeon said . " I asked for a Strykers Bar " ( caramel , peanuts , and nougat dipped in chocolate , their version of a Snickers bar ) " but it has peanuts too ! Dammit . So I called in the Stryker Rep and asked what other options I had . He recommended Nacho Cheese Chips , as they would pair perfectly with my Stryker apple juice . Cool , right on again Stryker Man . "
