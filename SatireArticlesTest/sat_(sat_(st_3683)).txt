Increasingly , we live in a country of specialty and gourmet food and drink . Cafe Breve Mocha Valencia , Caramel Macchiato and the list goes depressingly on and on . It ' s important to remember one important fact : it ' s just a cup of coffee folks , so get over it and drink up . People who use something like coffee to prove they ' re cool really aren ' t . It ' s akin to believing that Pre Emptive Liberation is a wise foreign policy course or that allowing thousands of people to die of painful lingering diseases in order to save a stem cell , is what God would want . ( My Editor was right I can ' t write a simple humor piece anymore without spewing out some radical political venom . The truth is , George W . Bush is indeed responsible for bad coffee everywhere and should be impeached because of it . Damn , I ' m never gonna get that coveted slot writing for the Living Section . )
