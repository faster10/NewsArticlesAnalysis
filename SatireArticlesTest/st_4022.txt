So while Sarah proudly points to the fact that Alaskans pay no income tax or general sales tax ( but let ' s not forget the 18 . 78 per gallon on liquor and 1 . 05 on beer , both the highest in the land ) , she neglects to explain just how this shining example of tax freedom works massive amounts of Federal dollars added to that the highest taxes on corporations who work there , plus payouts from the oil industry , plus lots and lots of property taxes and you ' ve got A ) a State that really takes advantage of the rest of America and B ) a tax system that , due to getting 80 of it ' s working capitol from the oil industry , could never work anywhere else in the country . Sarah Palin ' s Alaska is an economic time bomb . Tea Party people are afraid of bombs .
