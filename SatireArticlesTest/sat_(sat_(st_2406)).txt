Prison Administrators are allegedly scrambling to account for the leak of Mr Fogle ' s medical exam results , which included , as standard procedure , the running of the inmate ' s DNA profile against a database of all known unsolved crimes , especially rape cases and missing children reports . While officials insist that there are still a very large number of unknown unknowns involved in understanding the causes of the leak of this information , they have been careful not to deny any specifics of the medical report , nor it ' s existence , at least so far . Administrators have also refused multiple requests to release the official document , citing client privilege concerns .
