MS : I went to school with them at the Notre Dame , dude . They haven ' t changed a bit . They ' re all such righteous dudes and they ' re dead spent on honing their chops and continuing to be the best band around . From my Marxist perspective , the UM scene is one of a communal utopia . We all share the bountiful gifts of music , treats , and favors as each individual provides toward the goal of the collective . Everyone is enriched because of it and we all have a rage time at the shows .
