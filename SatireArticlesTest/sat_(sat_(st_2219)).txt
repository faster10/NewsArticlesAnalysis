" All we meant to do by promoting that amazing piece by Mr Owens , " Gachette said as he ended the press conference , " was to suggest to our members that voting isn ' t the only option they have if they feel like no matter what the facts say that liberals are coming to take their guns away . We were just suggesting that maybe it will come to a point where our paranoia pushes us to determine that instead of making reasoned arguments for why it makes sense to not really check all that carefully into who is getting a gun , we need to make war with liberal Democrats . That ' s not a threat , or a warning , " Gachette said , " just a suggestion to not take any option off the table . "
