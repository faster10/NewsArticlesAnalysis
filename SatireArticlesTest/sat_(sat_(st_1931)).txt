" I can ' t keep up with demand , " says shop owner Hovick . " This trend has hit a surge , and now , it ' s very , very popular . " When pressed to comment on Huckabee ' s pregnancy abortion tie in with waist training , Hovick tersely responded , " Women aren ' t into hiding their bodies during pregnancy anymore like they were in the 1950s and 1960s , wearing those tent like garments to conceal themselves , and no sensible woman would wear a restrictive corset while pregnant ! The two issues are not related in any way . Waist training and corseting aren ' t political or moral issues , they ' re fashion trends end of story ! "
