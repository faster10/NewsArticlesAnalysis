" I ' ve been married for 42 years of my life and I was faithful all those years but once , and I never would ' ve cheated on Betty for one of those damn pigs " he admitted . " But since Betty ' s gone , I ' ve been so lonely , and I guess the Devil ' s played them tricks on me and got me to screw those ugly pigs , and now I ' m surely going to die , and I know God is punishing me , and I fully deserve it " admits the 76 year old man .
