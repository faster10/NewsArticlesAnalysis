It ' s not that I don ' t sympathize with his feelings any guy with a shaved head looks like a Neo Nazi to me and any kid in gangsta gear looks like a banger . But I figure that the Evil Doer ' s have figured out that if they want attack something they ' re gonna go to great lengths to not look like a threat they ' re not gonna be wearing flowing robes and carrying a scimitar or anything it ' s counter productive , you see . And anyway , Richard Reed or that guy from Ft . Hood , Nadal Hanson , didn ' t look " look Muslim " . The dopes .
