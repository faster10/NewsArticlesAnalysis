It might not be clear from this article , but I do not watch a lot of football . But you know which sport I do watch a lot of ? Tennis . And tennis is very similar to football , if you think about it . In tennis , the player ( the quarterback ) serves the ball to his opponent ( the opposing team ) , who hits the ball ( the ball ) back across the net ( the grass ) , and both players ( coaches ) try either to hit a winner ( make a basket ) or make their opponent hit an error ( get a red card ) .
