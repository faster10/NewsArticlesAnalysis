In a weirdly related story , Florida Governor Jeb Bush was forced to abandon his efforts to stage a jail break of Teri Schiavo , ignoring a ruling by a Florida judge that Ms . Schiavo ' s feeding tube be removed and the poor woman finally be allowed to pass on . The Florida Department of Law Enforcement , Jeb Bush ' s personal police force , decided that it would not engage in an armed confrontation with the local Sheriff ' s Department who were more than willing to stage what some in the department termed " a showdown " with the State goons . Said one Sheriffs Department employee , " We ' ve been dealing with having to arrest pro life children and religion crazed old ladies and overweight Tennesseans , so those idiots from the State had no chance .
