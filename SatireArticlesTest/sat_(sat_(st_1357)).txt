This isn ' t the first time that medical and nursing students have saved lives , just ask Charlie Richie of Virginia Medical School who just last year saved the life of an elderly woman on a flight home for Christmas . " When the flight attendant asked if there was a doctor on board , I knew I had to act . " Charles made his way up to an elderly woman complaining of back pain , past an NP who was in the middle of taking a thorough social history . Charles believed the woman to be having a heart attack and requested the plane to be grounded .
