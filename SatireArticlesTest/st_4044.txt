" My view in regards to gay relationships has always been that whatever laws consenting adults wished to break in their own homes was their business so long as it did not affect my family . The problem is that we live in a different , post 9 11 time , where Americans have had to willingly sacrifice privacy in the war on terror with the ultimate goal of freedom and democracy for the world . The secrecy involved in gay relationships is a threat to our national security , and it cannot be corrected by simply making it all " legal " . "
