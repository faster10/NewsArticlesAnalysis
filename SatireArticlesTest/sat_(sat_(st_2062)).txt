Kahn , who runs a local construction company , said that he ' d be " ready to think about gun violence " the next time one happens , but for now he ' s " just too burned out to talk about it . " Kahn said that he " really , really " wants to do something about guns , " but it ' s really , really hard " and he ' s an American so he ' d rather " just watch about it on the news until I ' m bored or overloaded and then forget about it for a day until it happens again .
