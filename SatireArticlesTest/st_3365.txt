When the involvement of the Ayres Weatherman Terrorist group was made public , a scandal erupted and the Senate Ethics Committee launched their own investigation into whether the Ayres Weatherman Terrorist group had violated Senate ethics rules . The other four Senators left office either immediately or within one term . Barack Obama was formally rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee for exercising " poor judgment " for intervening with the federal regulators on behalf of Ayres , but because Obama accepted Ayres ' s gifts of travel and vacations to Bahama while Obama was a member of the House of Representatives ( he served one term there before moving to the Senate ) , the Senate claimed they had no jurisdiction to censure Obama . ( However the meetings to pressure federal regulators occurred during the first few months of Obama serving in the Senate in 2006 , so that excuse doesn ' t hold up )
