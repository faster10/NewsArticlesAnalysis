When their time comes to make decisions about how to spend their tax monies at the federal level they will be in such a financial bind that they won ' t have any choices to make at all . And that is the point , make all the choices now so they those dumb kids can ' t make any bad ones for themselves . They won ' t be able to wildly misspend what they don ' t have and can ' t borrow because we maxed out America ' s credit . And besides , we ' ll all be dead by then anyway .
