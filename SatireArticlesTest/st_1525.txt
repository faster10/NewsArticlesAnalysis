At some point earlier this year during a trip through Arizona , it is believed that Buddy came into contact with the rabies virus . " He was lost for a period of time while camping . When we found him it looked like he had been in a scrap with some other animal . He had a lot of tiny scratches and abrasions around his face and eyes . We thought nothing of it at the time , we were simply happy to have our Buddy back " , the dogs owner , Zoe Quinn reported .
