So far ten books have been ghost written by excused jurors since the jury selection process began on Monday . While the public currently has a meager choice between " My Fifteen Minutes With Michael " , " Michael ' s Shoes : The Shocking Truth " , " Why Was I Dismissed ? I Was Acquitted of Buggery ( Memoirs of a Dismissed Jackson Juror ) " and a few others , the rest are being rushed to print and are slated to hit the shelves by mid week .
