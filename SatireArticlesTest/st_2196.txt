Last month ' s opening day was a sellout . " It was Thanksgiving week and that can go one way or the other , " Debunker explained . " Either everyone ' s at home cooking like the dickens so no one comes out , or folks are sick to death of cooking and everybody comes out , but it turned out good . We almost had to send people away , but you don ' t want to tell hungry folks with a gun ' sorry , go over to McDonald ' s . ' " If business keeps up , Debunker may add another dining room .
