You heard me right . That Roth IRA that lets you withdrawal money in the future tax free is taking billions from your kids . Think about it future , tax free . Who do you think would have collected those taxes in the future . Your kids , you big dummy . But really don ' t worry about it . The Roth IRA is going to deprive the next generation of billions of dollars of tax revenues that they would spend ( waste ) on whatever they think is a good idea in the future . We pay taxes on the money now , spend the taxes now , and then shaft the next generation . I wonder what scammer though this idea up . But don ' t worry about those little bankrupt babies , really .
