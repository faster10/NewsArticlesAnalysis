" That ' s exactly what the terrorists want us all to believe , " said the 64 year old former governor . " To catch us off guard . Borders is working underground now , so don ' t believe everything you hear from the lamestream media and those Katie Couric ' gotcha journalism ' types out there . When a tragic event like the French happens to distract us from what ' s really going on , well goshdarnit that ' s exactly when the radical terroists slip in through our cracks and border crevices to carry out their activities . Disinformation is still being spread . That ' s how sleeper cells work . Well it ' s time for America to wake the heck up ! "
