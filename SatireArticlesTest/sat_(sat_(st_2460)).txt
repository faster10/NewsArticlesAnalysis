Republican legislatures in states as widespread as Ohio , Kansas , Florida , Wisconsin and Texas , are proposing several new laws which they say will not only expose ' food cheating ' but at the same time protect the integrity of voting , ensuring that the process is free of rampant ' Democratic fraud ' .
