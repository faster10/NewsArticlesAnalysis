I hate to admit it , but this has been going on since I was a teen . I KNOW ! Early on , I couldn ' t cope . I was bleeding through my underwear , I didn ' t know what to do . You know what else ? I can ' t believe I ' m going to tell you this but every time I bleed , I plug up my vagina with something . I ' m serious ! I mean , what would YOU do ? How else am I supposed to control the bleeding ? I ' ve tried numerous things , believe me , but thank goodness I found these things called tampons . I ' m not sure what they ' re actually supposed to be used for , but it ' s been a lifesaver for me !
