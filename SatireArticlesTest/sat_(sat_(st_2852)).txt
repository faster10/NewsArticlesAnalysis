" I wanted to believe I had a chance by being the sane option at the Republican convention , but this campaign turned into an addiction . The right thing to do is step out of the race . I did enjoy talking to the dozens of people who showed up to my town halls and my staff did a great job of getting my name and policy out to the people . But at the end of the day , the people wanted someone different . It ' s been a strange political race and the timing wasn ' t in my corner . "
