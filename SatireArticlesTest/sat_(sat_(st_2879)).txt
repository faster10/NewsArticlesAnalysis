Oddly enough , and not to nit pick , but that doesn ' t seem to be part of the settlement . We ' re not sure why , but maybe you lost perspective on who really took it on the chin here ? I mean , the Deepwater Horizon spill killed , what , almost a dozen humans ? But in our world , we lost millions of family members . Snapper , porgies , eels , phytoplanktons . I ' m just sayin ' . Oh , and we can ' t help but notice we suddenly have all these shrimp with no eyes , crustaceans with limbs falling off , fish that limp . Well , no , they don ' t really limp . They swim funny . I ' m just trying to make this relatable .
