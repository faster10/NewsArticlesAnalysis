In a news conference held during a visit to a marine terminal in Baltimore , Maryland Mr Bush said , " We ' re spending unprecedented resources to protect our nation . Of course , this comes after spending unprecedented resources to destroy Iraq and increase the number of new recruits to al Qaida by the tens of thousands . However , between the spending of these two unprecedented resources , the United States can look forward to the next six hundred years of crushing debt , which is actually a good thing . You see , the terrorists hate us , not because of our freedoms as we originally thought , but because after eight years of Bill Clinton we were rich as shit and they were getting jealous . By making it so that the average American will have to struggle to buy their family a potato for dinner , the hope is that the Terrorists will start to feel sorry for us and leave us alone . "
