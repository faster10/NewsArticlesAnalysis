Kirkuk The violent storms which have hit northern Irak recently , have unearthed the remnants of a gigantic antique ship dating approximately 10 000 years . It is the heavy rains of the last weeks which have badly damaged the roads and caused major landslides in the governates of Dahuk and Kirkuk , that have uncovered the carcass of the huge cargo vessel , near the summit of Mount Gir e Kumar . The amazing size of the boat and its location at more than 1650 meters above sea level , have brought various scholars to claim that this could be the vessel described in the Biblical flood narrative ( Genesis chapters 6 9 ) by which God saves Noah , his family , and a remnant of all the world ' s animals .
