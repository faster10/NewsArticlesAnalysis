" Firstly , it ' s hilarious because have you ever tried to buy expensive food items , " asked Rep . Becky Blankenship ( D ) . " They ' re expensive , right ? So I ' m not quite sure which ' poor people ' that the Republicans think are spending their hard earned money on lobsters and whatnot , do you want to know something really ironic and sad ? Lobster and crab were once considered the food of the lower classes . They ' re cockroaches of the sea , after all , and at the time this great nation was founded , no upper crust member of society would be caught dead slumming it with lobster . And that ' s to say nothing about the multiple health benefits of seafood in general . Should we deny poor people access to air and water too , since they ' re so poor and all , " Blankenship asked our reporter .
