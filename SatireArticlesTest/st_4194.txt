The Washington Post and a couple other papers are out there talking about what they describe as the " Tea Party Advantage " for Democrats the premise is that the Tea People Christine O ' Donnell , Carl Palladino , Rand Paul and the like are so out there , so obviously whacky , that regular Republicans will stay away from them and the Democrats are getting fired up and will actually go vote . This is exactly what every good little Conservative wants you to believe , so don ' t you believe it . Hell , it may even be true , but don ' t you believe it . Don ' t you believe America ' s somehow waking up . I mean , get real .
