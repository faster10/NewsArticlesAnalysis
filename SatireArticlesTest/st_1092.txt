A white cloud has an easy , painless , perhaps even fun shift or call . " Ahhh , what a good night ! " a white cloud might say while stretching , smiling ear to ear , and appearing quite refreshed . A white cloud survives unscathed . A black cloud encounters hell and meets The Four Horsemen themselves . Sirens blaring . Nonstop pages . Chaos and dismay . A black cloud ' s once clean and neatly pressed scrubs are tattered , bloodied , and shredded . Bags under the eyes . Arms sore from perpetual chest compressions . At the end of the shift , a black cloud merely shakes his or her head in disbelief , yearns for a hug , and desperately wants to go home . A white cloud always leaves work on a sunny day and can ' t wait to go to the gym , go for a run .
