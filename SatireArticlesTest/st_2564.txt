" She just kept right on going after they arrested those two criminals , " said Sally Kilmeade , who calls herself a Palin superfan . " It was awesome , she didn ' t miss a beat like water rolling off a duck ' s back . We just cheered louder and louder . Just the sound of her voice brought tears to my eyes . "
