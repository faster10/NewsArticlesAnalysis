Wall Street analysts watched in stunned amazement as the corporation ' s stock plummeted to 20 . 58 , representing a loss of over 18 points from the day ' s opening . One Wall Street analyst called the loss financially devastating . " The Street ' s reaction was like nothing I ' ve ever seen , " said conservative analyst Wil Albanese . " I think his remarks were irresponsible , immature , and unfair to the entire corporate community . I find it interesting that the President chose to criticize Sony , while saying nothing negative about North Korea . "
