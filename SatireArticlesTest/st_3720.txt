I know , I know , everyone thinks New York is a Liberal Democratic state , but trust me , we aren ' t . New York City is a liberal area , but New York State , an area the size of the country of South Africa , is actually pretty conservative . In addition to living and working for a decade or so in Manhattan and five years here in Syracuse , I lived for three years in the Adirondack Mountains and ten years in the Catskills . Trust me , rural New Yorkers are overwhelmingly conservative Republicans , and I don ' t mean ' moderate conservative Republicans ' like Rudy Giuliani , I mean gun toting , church going , Hillary hating , red neck Republicans , god bless em .
