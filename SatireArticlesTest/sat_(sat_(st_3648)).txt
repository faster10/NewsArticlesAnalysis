One White House official , speaking on condition of anonymity , told me , " These slogans and cliches that neocons use , you think they can come up with that stuff themselves ? Of course not ! Who in their right mind could come up with such wacky stuff ? Most people ' s imaginations do not run wild enough . Instead , they must pay consultants millions of dollars to come up with ideas like : we need to fight them over there , so we don ' t have to fight them over here . "
