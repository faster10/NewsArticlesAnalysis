" I know Bill Clinton is my father " says the young girl . " I have many pictures of my mother and him and I know they were in love . He even gave me pr sents for Christmas and my birthdays when I was a kid , before he left my mother . I have spent many years writing him letters and calling him , hoping he would come back in my life . At first , he would write back and we spoke on the phone regularly , but he doesn ' t even answer anymore . I just want him to take his responsibilities and recognize that he is my father , that ' s all . "
