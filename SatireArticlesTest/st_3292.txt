Seriously ? I could give you my house . You can also have the sociology department . Think about it : your very own group of sociologists ! You could be living in my house with a bunch of sociologists and having just the time of your life , drinking coffee and doing sociology . Do you like cats ? I have four cats . You can have three of them . You could be sitting in a hot tub with a bunch of sociologists , contemplating the future of academia , with cats walking around . I honestly can ' t think of a better way to reconnect with your alma mater .
