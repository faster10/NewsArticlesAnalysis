Nearby climbs Icarus , smaller than many of his kind , but with a determination not seen since the days of his father , Leafrunner , and his mother , Dart . He never knew his parents , but he senses their presence . Though he cannot explain it , he knows , deep down in his ventriculus , that the spirit of his cicadean ancestors is what drives him , pulls him upward , makes him believe that today , Emergence Day , anything is possible . He pauses to catch his breath on a branch and wonders if they can see him , if they are proud of him . But then a bird eats him .
