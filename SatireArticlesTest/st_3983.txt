The episode of " The Oprah Winfrey Show " is scheduled to air Monday , November 16th , a day before Palin ' s memoir hits the shelves and two days before Palin embarks on a book tour in a bus with her family . The former Republican Vice Presidential candidate mentioned the tour in her Facebook blog prior to her appearance . " We ' re taking it to the streets , you betcha , me and the family . We ' re like " The Brady Bunch " when they went to the Grand Canyon , except we ' re going to more places , and we don ' t have a gay dad . " Palin later retracted the statement , admitting that she had mistaken " The Partridge Family " for " The Brady Bunch " , " and I apologize to fans of both . "
