Oh , there ' s one more idiotic thing here in order to vote for anything , you have to have registered in time to vote in a gubernatorial election first , so if I ' d wanted to support Gay marriage ( which I did ) I couldn ' t have because I ' d have had to wait till this year to register to vote for Jerry Brown , then I ' m golden . But if I moved here in December of this year , I ' d have to wait four more years to participate in any ballot initiative . That seems not only unfair , but blatantly illegal . The purpose of that is to stop New York assholes from racing into California , registering to vote , then voting for or against something , to which I answer , " Would you stop calling me an asshole , you twerps ? "
