Now , I ' m not a real slumlord , I just play one in the Westcott Nation . And it ' s my home too . It ' s a great place to live , even for a couple of semesters . We have a fantastic mix of ethnicities , political viewpoints , social and religious beliefs and whether you ' re an Army major going for an MBA so you can work at the Pentagon or a worker at the Syracuse Peace Council , you ' re welcome here . We ' re tolerant and open minded , as long as you ' re not acting like a complete idiot . Are be honest , you ' ve been acting like a complete idiot , haven ' t you ? So now that classes are beginning , calm down and act like good neighbors . In return , we ' ll be nice to you . Mostly .
