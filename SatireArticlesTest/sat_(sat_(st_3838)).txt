Morgan Stanley , in an effort to stave off death , has become a bank . While this is a good move , as it allows them to accrue investor capitol , I was interested to see what effect it had on the employees of that venerable institution , so lately high flying stock market traders , so I drove to my local office . The employee lot was filled with Porches and Benz ' s , all with for sale signs in their windows . Inside , behind the teller windows were a dozen or so men and women in four thousand dollar suits and five hundred dollar haircuts , looking slightly dazed as they stared at deposit slips and cash drawers .
