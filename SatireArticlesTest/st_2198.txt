" There shouldn ' t be separate booths , said Hazel Burke of Winston Salem . " But now that they ' re here , if I absolutely had to , I ' d go in a transgender booth . If lines were too long in the other voting booths and I was running short on time , then I ' d duck in and do it . You can ' t turn transgender just by touching a lever , and besides , I only get a half hour lunch break . "
