" More businesses are going to suffer and possibly shut down over these wrongheaded protests against religious freedom and it ' s just not fair . I wanted to do something about it .

It ' s a damn shame when a Governor has to bow to pressure all because of some people ' s close mindedness . I just wanted to do my part . "
