" Some in the liberal media want to paint us haters , " Cruz said to the crowd , " just because we distrust people who have already been thoroughly vetted . They say we ' re anti immigrant just because we think it ' s more practical and moral to deport 11 million people and build a massive , expensive wall than it is to work with the Mexican government and create a new system of immigration that benefits all parties . Well , I say poppycock to them . If we true , red blooded , ammo hoarding Americans want to stoke an emotionally bankrupt narrative of apathy toward refugees and hostility to those coming here merely to make a better life for themselves and their families then we will do so and no hippy dippy Obama voter ' s gonna stop us !
