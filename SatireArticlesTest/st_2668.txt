" These are people who have committed horrific crimes and have shown no chance of ever being receptive to any kind of rehabilitation or treatment . It costs taxpayers millions of dollars a year to persecute , convict and house these criminals year after year . They are people who contribute absolutely nothing to society other than the pain and anguish that their victims must endure for the rest of their lives . Really , there is no justice in that process . With this new program , these offenders will at least be able to provide something of value to society . We realize that many see this as a cruel and unusual solution , but the majority of the public has agreed that these people basically revoked their rights to be treated with respect and dignity the moment they chose to commit their crimes .
