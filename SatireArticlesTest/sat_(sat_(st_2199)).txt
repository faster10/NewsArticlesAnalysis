Ryan Townsend , an international relations consultant , feels that North Korea has reportedly elected to induct Rose in an attempt to " show up " the United States . " It ' s a forgone conclusion that Pete Rose is never going to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame , " says Townsend . " Clearly Kim Jong Un sees this as a chance to embarrass and upstage the United States by including an American in their Sports Hall of Fame . In a way , I feel he is attempting to say that North Korea is willing to forgive and forget the sins of an individual like Pete Rose , whereas the United States remains stubborn and holds grudges against their own citizens .
