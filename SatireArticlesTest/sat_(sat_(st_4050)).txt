Shuttle astronaut Steve Robinson spacewalked to remove a piece of cloth like material from the bottom of the space shuttle Discovery . Described as two pieces of gap filler , with The Gap logo plainly visible on the material , the removal was originally planned to take as long as an hour , but was accomplished within minutes . Mission Control specialists are still trying to figure out which astronaut was responsible for the pair of woman ' s low rise soft nylon trim hipster panties and scoop stretched tee shirt top , as well as a bottle of Jose Cuervo Gold that was found later in the cargo hold .
