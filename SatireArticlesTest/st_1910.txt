When asked how Republicans plan to draw up the articles for someone who has yet to take office , Boehner continued . " It ' s easy actually . The articles of impeachment will be drawn up like a Mad Libs contract . All we have to do is insert nouns , verbs , adjectives , and maybe even some adverbs . Once the language had been agreed upon and the articles of impeachment served we can skip right ahead to her removal from office , a step we failed to get to with her husband . "
