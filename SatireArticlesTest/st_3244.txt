I bet you ' ll be shocked to see me riding an ATV . Look for the parrot on my right shoulder . It landed there the instant the photo was taken and appears to be smiling . It just flew down out of a tree , perhaps drawn by the Laotian wafers I had been eating . With my fake earring and bandana and the parrot on my shoulder , you might mistake me for an ATV riding pirate , just like the one on the root beer label !
