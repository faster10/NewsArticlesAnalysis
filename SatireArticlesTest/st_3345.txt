On Princess Diana ' s death : " Her children knew she ' s sleeping with all these men . That just seems to me , it ' s the definition of ' not a good mother . ' Is everyone just saying here that it ' s okay to ostentatiously have premarital sex in front of your children ? " " Diana is an ordinary and pathetic and confessional I ' ve never had bulimia ! I ' ve never had an affair ! I ' ve never had a divorce ! So I don ' t think she ' s better than I am . " MSNBC 9 12 97
