" Income inequality is the new racism in this country . It ' s the next thing we need to topple with a civil rights movement , " Cruz said during his speech , in an effort that would eventually turn the crowd to his side . " Liberals are on the wrong side of history with income inequality . Barack Obama is on the wrong side of history . But if we take up this cause right now , if we make it a bedrock conservative principal , if we join our hands and our wallets and really get behind this thing , we can really make a difference . We can stop income inequality before it becomes an even bigger travesty than it already is . "
