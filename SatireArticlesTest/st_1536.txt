" The app itself contains all of the same information you ' d find in an electronic benefits transfer , or EBT , ' card . So we ' re just essentially making this compatible with modern remote payment technology , " says Apple Software Developer Noah Prune , the lead designer of the Apple EBT app . " There are credit card machines all across America where you don ' t need to swipe your card . You just need to wave it near the machine . Apple EBT should be fully compatible with all of those machines nationwide . "
