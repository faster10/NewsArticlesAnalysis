Within a minute , all the Nuns ( and myself ) were kneeling in the damp dirt , heads bowed in prayer after all , that ' s what Nuns do crying through innumerable " Our Fathers " and " Hail Marys " . It was amazing to be a part of . Dr King wasn ' t a Catholic of course , but to the Nuns he was still a martyred man of God and his brand of religion didn ' t matter at all . Or maybe , they knew what was coming and were praying that it wouldn ' t happen . Or maybe both .
