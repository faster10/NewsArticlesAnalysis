At 3 o ' clock yesterday morning , Dr Tammany tried to consent Ledbury for right knee surgery when he found him completely disoriented . Worried about his mental status , Orthopedics recommended a Medicine consult and Psychiatry to aid with delirium and evaluation for medical decision making capacity . Yesterday afternoon , Psychiatry felt the patient was appropriate but did recommend ruling out all other causes for delirium . Dr Tammany played it safe and consulted Neurology , Cardiology again , Pulmonology , Infectious Diseases again , Endocrine , Rheumatology , and Hematology Oncology .
