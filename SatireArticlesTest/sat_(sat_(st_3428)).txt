By all accounts , the speech had begun well , with the president attempting to frame his points at the level of the children present . Minutes into the speech however , half of the classroom stood up and turned their backs on the president , some holding protest signs which they had apparently made for the event . The president attempted to press on with the speech , ignoring the disruption as the Secret Service personnel appeared undecided as to what to do . The protesters largely remained silent . There were reports that an initial attempt by the Secret Service was made to drag one child from the room . This was apparently abandoned after a few severe kicks to the shin from the child in question who was then allowed to remain .
