One reporter asked Gergio to elaborate on his famous insulin tubing day . " Well , the patient was in DKA day 2 and I disconnected the insulin from the IV . The nurse called the doctor 4 times to switch algorithms , finally when the rate was 142 units an hour and no change in his blood sugar , the doc came to the bedside . He saw a large puddle in the bed , picked up the floating IV tube and said , ' Let ' s hook this up OK ? ' Oh boy THAT was funny . "
