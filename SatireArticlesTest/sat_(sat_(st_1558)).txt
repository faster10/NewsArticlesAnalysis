Tentatively dubbed " The Bachmann Network , " Hulu will develop a standalone website that will deliver original programming , formatted more like an actual TV network , or a big name site like Hulu or Netflix , than the Palin Channel , which airs occasional videos , links to Bristol Palin ' s blog , and puts up random photos and quotes . The Bachmann channel will have proper TV style shows , a news desk , and even occasional movies from both Hulu ' s collection of films and conservative filmmakers who will sign deals in the future to develop exclusively for the Bachmann Network .
