" His scrubs and white coat were tattered and bloodied . He was barefoot . He was bound so tightly by his schedule , just worked to the bone . He was in the hospital thirty hours at a time , sometimes working weeks in a row without a day off . He was pimped , scutted ruthlessly . Attendings scolded him . He was isolated in a dank , dark call room without bed sheets and a pillow that could be measured in millimeters in thickness . He was sleep deprived and poorly fed , surviving on graham crackers , saltines , the nurse ' s candy drawer , and caffeine alone . Sometimes , his captors would make him admit on clinic days . Talk about an act of cruelty . "
