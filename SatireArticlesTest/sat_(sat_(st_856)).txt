Mark Shiwani , ER nurse , spoke with us during our visit and reported that he feels blessed to work with multiple patients during their entire course of treatment . " I ' ve been here for four nights in a row and taken care of Mr Gandy in ER 7 for the last two . He ' s suffering with another infected diabetic foot ulcer . But , I ' m pretty sure we can get him back to 100 , or at least 91 , without him ever having to set remaining foot on another floor . "
