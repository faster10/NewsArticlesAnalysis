Westmund says that seeing people like Carson and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee be so unapologetic in their dismissive tone toward rape victims has emboldened him to be more " out front " with his own views on the subject . " I just cannot wait to go over to Planned Parenthood and tell every single woman I see entering that facility that if she gets an abortion she ' s a murderer , even if she was drugged , knocked out , pinned down , or raped at knife or gun point . Because you don ' t get to take control over your own sexual reproduction in this country , no matter how horrific and terrifying the circumstances of conception were , " Westmund said .
