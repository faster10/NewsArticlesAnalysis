Proposition 90 would mean that a plot of private property overlooking the ocean could be bought for its asking price of 229 , 000 and a 10 million house planned for the site . Regardless of the " parks and recreation " use imposed by the coastal commission , a house could be built , or the owner would be eligible for 10 million compensation for what the house would have fetched on the open market . Similarly , other restrictions on development would be equally costly . Development of beaches and marine reserves , gravel pits in downtown areas , and oil wells on beaches would be allowed , or the state would have to pay property owners for the loss of the wildest imagined uses of their land .
