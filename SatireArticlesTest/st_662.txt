The cause of Schiavo ' s bed ridden state isn ' t the only area where the church and the medical autopsy differ a medical examiner concluded that Schiavo ' s vision centers were completely dead and she was therefore blind , while the church maintains that all her senses were present and functioning , so much so that she often performed Riverdance in the evenings when her husband was not keeping her bedridden with his glares and smarmy remarks . Fortunately for the church , Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist disagrees with the medical autopsy .
