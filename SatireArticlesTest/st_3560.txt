It ' s election day morning six or eight more hours of political commercials and then it ' s all over bar the shouting . Of course , given the current crop of Tea Party candidates , a fair number of whom will probably win , the shouting may go on for a very long time . The problem is , there ' s a lot of important stuff that needs to be done and just shouting won ' t get any of it finished , or even started . If the " GOP " wins I quoted it because now there ' s the regular Republican Party and of course those " other guys " , the Tea Party Wing this won ' t just be a ' tempest in a tea cup ' , it ' ll be a full blown nightmare . I ' ve argued here before , years ago , that the reason America woks ( " Woks ? " Er works . Not to say woking isn ' t hard work , what with the flames and all . ) is the two party system and the reason Italy , Israel and places like that don ' t is that multi party governments must form coalitions that fracture and fail , bringing down elected governments . Well , we ' re about to see if that prediction is correct .
