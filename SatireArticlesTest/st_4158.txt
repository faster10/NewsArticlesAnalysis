The reply has a ' fired off ' quality , as if Mr Wolf felt my words deserved some comment , but since the writer ( me ) was kind of a dope ( spot on ! ) , not a very nuanced one the kind you ' d give a likeable , low ' C ' student ( spot on again ! ) to get him to shut up and think a little harder . It also brings up the illegal wire tapping issue of this last decade under the Cheney Bush Administration .
