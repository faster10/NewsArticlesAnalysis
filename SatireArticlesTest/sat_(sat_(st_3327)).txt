So , distracted by Iraq , we let Afghanistan fall by the wayside . The Taliban came back and we did nothing to stop them . Suddenly , we were simultaneously fighting both a ' good ' war and a ' bad ' one and the two got so mixed up we couldn ' t tell them apart . If we had only devoted a tenth of the resources from Iraq into building roads , schools and hospitals infrastructure in Afghanistan and left Iraq alone or at least only supported the Kurds if only we didn ' t try to adhere to the unnatural borders drawn by the British when the Raj collapsed ah , if only . What matters now is that we did it all wrong . The question is , do we try to fix it or just walk away ?
