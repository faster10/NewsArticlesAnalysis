Let ' s say you live in Vermont near the New Hampshire border . You can drive across that border and buy anything gas , clothes , food , whatever and not pay state sales tax . New Hampshire just doesn ' t collect it . Or say you live near the Canadian border and cross over to buy your medications or pretty much anything there for less than you can get them in the States . Until recently at least , New Yorkers could go to New Jersey and get gas a whole lot cheaper because while Jersey charges taxes , they ' re a lot less than New York ' s . None of that is illegal ( except technically the Canadian medication thing , but that ' s just the drug lobby ) , nor should it be . Why ? Because each state and country involved is a sovereign entity and can do what they want . So why should the Indian Nations , who are by treaty with both their individual states and the federal government sovereign nations , be treated any differently ?
