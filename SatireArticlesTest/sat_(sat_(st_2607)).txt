The source also alleges that this plan to partner up Subway and Oprah has been on the " back burner for a while " but will " cause Subway to lose some of their autonomy " so it was never seriously considered an option until now . Under the alleged partnership , Oprah will serve in the same capacity as Fogle did mainly her likeness being used in advertising . The deal will reportedly require Subway to run a " significant number of ads at a premium " on Winfrey ' s ' OWN ' cable channel . In addition , Subway will need to ruin a specific number of audio and print ads with Oprah ' s ' Oprah Friends ' satellite radio channel and in her ' O ' print magazine . The source also reports that Oprah will receive a " substantially higher salary than Fogle " for her participation in future ad campaigns .
