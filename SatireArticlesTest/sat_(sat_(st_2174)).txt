But it ' s true . Lately we have been bandying about the idea that Trump is sort of like the sun in a stupid solar system . We ' re not entirely sure how the sun got there , but we know it burns really brightly , intensely , and most importantly , completely stupidly , and it provides the stupid energy for even more stupid life forms in that stupid solar system .
