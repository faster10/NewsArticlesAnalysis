President Bush , in an effort to thank the Military for it ' s service in Iraq and Afghanistan has decided to slash Veterans Healthcare Benefits by 900 million dollars and Housing Benefits by 50 million . The President believes that the way to show his appreciation for the Armed Services ' efforts is to show them that he is streamlining government by reducing their ability to get adequate or timely medical care or find a decent place to live . Congressional lawmakers on both sides of the aisle , concerned that the White House ' s generosity has gone too far , are attempting to forestall the cuts with frivolous proposals to increase Veterans death benefits and Active Duty soldiers salaries .
