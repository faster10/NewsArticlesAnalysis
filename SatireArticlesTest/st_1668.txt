As of November 3rd , an internet search has not turned up any fan petitions to attempt to ' save ' the show , but many will likely surface in the coming days . There were several existing petitions asking for CBS to move CSI to a different time slot . Previous fan attempts to get ' CSI : Miami ' and ' CSI : NY ' saved from cancellation fell upon deaf ears at CBS . It is assumed similar attempts to convince CBS executives to grant a reprieve to ' CSI ' will also be ignored .
