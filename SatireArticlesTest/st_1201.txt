OUTSIDE METROPOLITAN HEALTH SYSTEM Let ' s face it , hospital cafeteria food is hideous , even when it ' s labeled correctly . That ' s why people in scrubs line up every day for the half a dozen food trucks park outside this hospital . Times have been hard for Sven Kombucha , owner of the Grass Fed Grass food truck , however . That was even before a health violation for including organic lawn clippings and mulch in his celebrated Green Fiber Smoothie . Apparently , customers prefer the Refried Refried Refried Beans ( no , that ' s not a typo ) of Wheeled Fryton or Lard Moo Shakes from The Cow Truck .
