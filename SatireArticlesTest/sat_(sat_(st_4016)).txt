These foreign affairs hold a particularly close place in the erstwhile Governor ' s heart , as she is solidly Pro Life and concerned that all these out of wedlock affairs could lead to abortion or even worse , little fatherless foreign babies that American taxpayers would have to foot the bill for when all these unwed foreign mothers bring their little bastard children to America to be a burden on our healthcare system and eat up all our food stamps . She has also come out solidly against Gay marriage , citing the fact that married Gay men would then get each other pregnant and have little Gay Babies that regular God fearing Christian babies would then have to fight for limited classroom space with as they grew up . It ' s a dire scenario , as chilling as hunting from a helicopter during a February in the Yukon .
