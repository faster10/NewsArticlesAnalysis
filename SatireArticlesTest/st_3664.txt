Military Guards at Camp Bucca in southern Iraq have discovered a 600 foot long tunnel that prisoners were digging in order to stage an escape . The tunnel was discovered after guards noticed that sewage lines were becoming clogged with dirt and sand which the prisoners were dumping down toilets in the latrines . Apparently the prisoners failed to notice that they were surrounded by millions of acres of sand and could have , with the smallest modicum of intelligence , dumped the stuff right there on the ground . Abdul bull Durham , one of the prisoners in the camp said , " You know , we all watched The Great Escape on video in order to prepare for this but I think the sneaky American guards must have edited some critical scenes . As it was , there was a great deal of discussion about what good Nazi identification papers and the ability to speak flawless German could help us . "
