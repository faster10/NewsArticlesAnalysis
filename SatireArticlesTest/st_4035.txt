Now , April already has the Christian Easter , which is actually perfect . We make Christmas on the 7th , go through the whole birth celebration , spend a week or two going over his life , then have the Good Friday Crucifixion Easter Sunday Miracle . Of course , in April there ' s also the Hebrew Passover and the Muslim Milad un Nabi , but this can be good too . April can be the Religion Month . We can have the Baha ' i ' s mediate any conflicts over parking around mosque ' s , churches and synagogues and the Wiccan ' s can just lay low till Beltane . If I missed anyone , I hope do me a favor and suffer in silence .
