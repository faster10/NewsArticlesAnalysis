In conclusion , my dear friends in Christ , you should be aware of the actual occurrences that take place at Burning Man , not the sanitized liberal media descriptions that you will no doubt hear . Why not take a family vacation for that week to someplace wholesome , like the creation museum or an NFL Preseason Game ? Take some time out to play catch with your son or talk with your daughter about what she may pursue in her leisure time . Send them to bible camp . Do anything that takes their minds away from the lure of Burning Man because it ' s plain to see the danger that this event poses to children and their personal relationship with Jesus .
