" That ' s a heavy burden to put on people to preserve the obsolete morality you ' re talking about , " says Dr Roger K . Pavlov of Harvard University , who ' s leading a propranolol study on soldiers fresh from Guantanamo Bay . " By that same logic , if you could make a lightweight bulletproof garment for soldiers we still shouldn ' t do it . For moral reasons we ought to make them able to be shot , to preserve the cost of war , the deterrent to war . But we work to prevent our soldiers from being shot , and I say there are mental bullets flying around in Washington , too . "
