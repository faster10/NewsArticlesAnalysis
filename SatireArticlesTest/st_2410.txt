There is speculation that the Duggar clan , now famous years later for their slice of life reality show about their extensive christian family and values , are somehow connected either to missing " Baby J " , or to allegations that they may be genetically related to Jared Fogle . That speculation was met with terse dismissal by all of the lawyers for the family , as " unprovable nonsense " not " worthy of comment " . As long as Jared Fogle remains incarcerated , and the Duggars themselves show no further interest in the matter , there is little the state can do regarding determining if there is a place in SCFCPSU , or in the hearts of this great christian family , let alone the rest of the country , for someone who may one day bear the name Jared Fogle Duggar .
