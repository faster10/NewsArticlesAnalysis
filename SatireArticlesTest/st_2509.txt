I must deny the invitation at this time with many thanks because I do not want to become involved in yet another fracking debate , not since the last time when I was there with Joe O ' Biden because I ended up looking like a fracking idiot according to all the newspapers put out by the lamestream media over the course of the next morning when I sat down for breakfast treats and to read all of em , any of ' em that have been in front of me over all these years and when I learned to read about how the event happened to play out in the media bias machine the next day . Therefore I don ' t want to go through that fracking mess again just because the Little Miss Know It All Katie Couric and media reporters of her elk can once again jump all over me free rain in the press and other media sources as the liberal controlled stations and papers tend to do . Instead they should be taking part of the issues that affect the patriotic real Americans across our great nation ' s borders protected by our many men and women soldiers that we ' ve lost interest among since fracking Obama who by the way is the most dangerous president in the history of the American legitimate constitutional presidencies which have gone on before him down there in Washington in spite of the fatcats and Martha ' s Vinyeard sic vacations and his golf buddies and also the pallin around with his terrorist homies while ISIS continues to dominate the world sage again , due to Barack Obama ' s fracking inactivity regarding the entire Benghazi type atmosphere which is not taken seriously by those of us who are in the know are able to do so .
