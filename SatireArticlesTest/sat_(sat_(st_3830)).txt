As of mid 2009 , the population of California was 36 , 961 , 664 , a suspiciously exact number , but Google Knows Best . I ' m not sure if this includes illegal or undocumented , depending on your politics immigrants as well I just didn ' t care enough to find out ( I ' m not a statistician , for Christ ' s sake . Go do your own homework . ) The point is , Meg ' s spending like , 3 . 25 for every human being in the state , or 7 . 05 for every registered voter ( I ' ll tell you this right now , she ain ' t gettin my vote for less than 15 . 00 I ' ve got my pride . But since I live in New York , I can ' t vote for her no matter how much she spends . Damn . ) .
