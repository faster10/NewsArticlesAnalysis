Instead of attacking Iran , the plan calls for the creation of a para military force , led by Oliver North , to invade Nicaragua and seize all proceeds derived from arms sales to Iran that were channeled to the Central American country during the 1980s . The funds will then be sent back to Iran in exchange for Iran ' s nuclear arsenal , which was purchased from the Reagan Bush administration in the Iran Contragate deal . Fifty percent of the funds will be deposited into the bank accounts of President Bush , Vice President Cheney , and other administration officials as part of the " recovery fee . "
