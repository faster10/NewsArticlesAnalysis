I know , I know , the free cable , hot breakfasts , and lumpy mattresses all create an atmosphere that is incredibly confusing since it resembles your favorite Holiday Inn . However , we actually are a hospital , not just a bunch of beds filled with some sick people . So , that means that your breakfast may not be the equivalent to IHOP ' s , we might not have Comedy Central as a choice of channels and sometimes , when your doctors come into your room , they might have to turn off the television so they can discuss your health . Although I know these lack of conveniences might lead you to believe that you are in a third world country , they probably don ' t deserve a one page written complaint .
