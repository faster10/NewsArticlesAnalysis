" We take the basic principles of homeopathy , such as the ' law of similars ' ( or ' like cures like ' ) , and ' potentisation ' ( or strengthening through serial dilution ) , and apply them to the production of novel blood components . " says Dr Simpson . " For example , if a patient is severely anemic , we request a 10 mL sample of their blood . We add that sample to a liter of normal saline , and strike it with a silver rod ( ' succussion ' ) . This activates the ' memory ' of the blood within the normal saline , allowing the whole solution to retain the vital energy of the blood . Then 10 mL of that solution is added to a new liter of normal saline . This process is repeated thirty times , for a typical 30C dilution , with each dilution enhancing the strength of the product . The end result is a highly potent unit of homeopathic blood , which is transfused back to the patient . "
