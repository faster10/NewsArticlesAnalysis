One of the more controversial proposals in the secret White House plan calls for sending the former American hostages who were released in exchange for weapons back to Iran as part of the package to get the weapons back from Iran . The plan stresses an importance in ensuring that former hostage Terry Anderson , who ran for Congress as a Democrat in 2003 , is one of the first people sent back into captivity . After consulting with a PR firm , the Bush administration has decided against ordering all of the former hostages back to Iran before testing public reaction with just Terry Anderson . Later this week , the Bush administration is expected to order Terry Anderson to surrender to federal authorities no later than 0900 on April 26 , so that he can be traded back to Iran in exchange for the weapons that the first President Bush sent to Iran in the first place . If public approval ratings do not deteriorate too sharply after the exchange , as some inside observers predict , the rest of the former hostages will also be ordered back to Iran in exchange for more weapons .
