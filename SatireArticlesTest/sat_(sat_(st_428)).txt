' And he just says , ' By no means , sir . All I require is some ale to soothe my tired spirit . ' Well , a polite guy like that , I just let him in . He looked a little disappointed when I told him , and he said , ' You mean I don ' t get any bounce at all ? ' And I just looked at him and said , ' Not a chance . ' "
