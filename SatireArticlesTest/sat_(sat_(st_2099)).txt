LOS VERDE VALLAS , NEW MEXICO Roberto Inmigrante has been a resident of his sleepy New Mexico town since late 2008 . Inmigrante came to the United States legally , he says , making sure all of his visa applications were in order , and he waited to be screened for any ties to terrorist activity . Inmigrante says he does not " begrudge anyone " who comes to the United States without following all the rules like he did , however , because as he says , " life is pretty shitty in other countries , so it ' s kind of a compliment to the U . S . that people are so desperate to get in . "
