Attractiveness The less physically attractive the complainant is , the more likely she is to claim rape for lessor transgressive behavior including such inane events as perverted jokes , groping , under skirt peeking , or unrequested film and photography . Women shunned by the opposite sex , which includes those who have not participated in coital activities with a partner for longer periods of time are more likely to file a rape complaint . Many psychologists agree that rape accusations made by unattractive women are mostly cries for help which point the finger back at the complainant in a futile effort to increase one ' s self worth . It has been proven that women who have not experienced coital bliss for lengthy amounts of time become more and more depressed . This leads to the kind of victimhood mindset that will launch a complaint .
