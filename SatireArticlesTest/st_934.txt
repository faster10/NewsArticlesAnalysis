There is a chance they don ' t pair you with anyone at all , but that ' s okay . The good news is you won ' t have to wait too long ! It ' s only 5 days until they put all your troubles to rest . You won ' t have to do much . Just send out a few applications , network , panic ( but only a little ) , think about research , change your specialty last minute , and consider another career altogether .
