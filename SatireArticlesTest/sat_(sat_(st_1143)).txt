I want my pager to have less irritating sounds . As it stands , my Pavlovian response is to hurl my pager off the roof of my building , hoping it smashes into thousands of useless bits and pieces , only to be run over by an array of marching bands and military tanks . Yet somehow I bet it would still make a sound . I ' d like to hear anything , literally anything else than the same painful alerts that have been haunting me for nearly a decade . I ' d take any of the following : Nuclear Explosion , Power Saw on Bone , Power Saw on Metal , Fork on Chalkboard , Incessant Midnight Car Alarm , Screaming Baby on Plane , Angry Psychotic , Gilbert Gottfried on Repeat , or Abnormally Loud Leaf Blower .
