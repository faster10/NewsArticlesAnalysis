Indiana residents were alarmed to hear that their city would be the first to support this sort of systematic imprisonment of people unwilling or unable to conform to the Obamacare health plans . Michelle Seymour of Amboy IN had the following to say in regards to these recent developments , " I have two elderly parents who are having trouble keeping their healthcare benefits since this whole Obamacare thing began , and now they might be forced into labor for something they never wanted ? They are retired ! You can ' t force the elderly to do hard physical labour , it will kill them ! "
