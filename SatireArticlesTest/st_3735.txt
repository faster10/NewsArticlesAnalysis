Add the 120 , 000 contract mercenaries and the forces involved in the Iraqi operation and the total comes to 300 , 000 to 360 , 000 , more than twice the " official " figure of 145 , 000 troops . This isn ' t counting the more than 5 , 000 British combat troops and navy , down from a high of 40 , 000 during the initial invasion , or the rag tag remnants of the highly vaulted " Coalition of the Willing , " which has dwindled since the beginning of the occupation to 27 mostly small countries such as Armenia , Estonia , Moldavia and Latvia .
