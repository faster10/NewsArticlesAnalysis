Administration officials now deny that such an executive order exists they say the media press have it confused with an earlier order for " aggressive techniques " issued by Pentagon chief Donald Rumsfeld , which was rescinded after complaints from military lawyers . They claim Bush only approved the use of military dogs to frighten prisoners , as long as they were muzzled . But the FBI papers state repeatedly and unequivocally that Bush himself authorized the aggressive techniques , and , as the abuses occurred long after the first Rumsfeld order was invalidated , the administration ' s denial is based on a clear falsehood .
