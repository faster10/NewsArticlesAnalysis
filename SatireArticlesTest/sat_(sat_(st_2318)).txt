Ryan was certain that if he " looked aloof and chewed gum the whole time " he ' d come off as " just the right amount of over it all " and that he ' d " give Americans the impression that he ' d literally shit all over the president and his terrible ideas if he had the chance . Ryan would tell his staff in the days leading up to the speech that he was beside himself with anxiety that " not enough people would want to reach through their TVs and sock him in the nose , " the aide told us .
