Gonzales : No . Just kidding ! I wish that there was some way that we could just beat this into the American public this administration does not condone torture of anyone as it is legally defined . We have worked hard to define it in such a way as to maximize its fear factor and propaganda value in the ongoing war against terror . Do we use some extreme interrogation techniques ? Yes , absolutely , when there is an imminent risk to American lives . But rest assured , any requests for such techniques are approved through a sanctioned Water Board .
