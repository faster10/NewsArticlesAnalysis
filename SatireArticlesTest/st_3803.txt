" I know I voted for this war in the beginning for the legitimate reasons given at the time . Then I was duped by the Liberal Media and Democratic party into believing that the evidence for going to war against Iraq was fabricated . However , after pondering over the last few years , switching parties and supporting the Republican Party makes the most sense to me . It is self evident now that the Republican Party is taking our country in a positive and prosperous direction . I especially feel proud that Bush is still , to this day , headstrong in defending our country from Iraq . It takes a real man to ignore so much overwhelming evidence and stick to his guns . I have finally come to realize that we are in for the long haul , but it is a sacrifice that must be made . "
