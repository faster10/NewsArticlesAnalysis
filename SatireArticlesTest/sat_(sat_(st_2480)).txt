Preibus told reporters , " Sequestering Republican voters from the truth is the only way we ' re going to get America back from the liberal agenda of equality of opportunity . If we can ' t keep our voters away from the reality of life that Hillary Clinton didn ' t personally order the entire U . S . Armed Forces to stand down during Benghazi , or that the IRS targeted progressive Super PACs too , or that Planned Parenthood was only getting reasonable compensation for the costs associated with handling biomedical waste then we are doomed as a party . This bubble must be fixed , it must be maintained , and it must forever shield we Republicans from the truth that people outside our party think we represent busted ass ideas of the past . That bubble will stay up , or my name isn ' t Reince Anrepeat Preibus ! "
