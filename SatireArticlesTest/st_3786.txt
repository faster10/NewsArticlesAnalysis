The President concluded his speech with , " This year will see your gasoline prices drop to 18 a gallon . Automobiles will be manufactured in the USA , and your government will soon have pure water flowing from your faucets once again . I promise you that the National Forests will again have trees . I foresee a great future , as our country , so ably administered by the great corporations of Christian America and the ten Bush Presidents before me , continues to dominate the cowering nations of the world ! "
