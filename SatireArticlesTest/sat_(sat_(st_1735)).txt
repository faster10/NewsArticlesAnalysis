Franz Hoetszel , 38 , discovered the 1941 file while visiting an antiques shop in the city of Langwasser , located just southeast of Nuremberg . " It was a lucky accident , or perhaps that is not the correct term to use , " said the soft spoken Hoetszel . " I saw a storage box with some printing I recognized as belonging to government files , so I asked the owner if I could see inside . He told me to take it since he was clearing his store of old junk . "
