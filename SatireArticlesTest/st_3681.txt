The whole problem started about three years into my coffee brewing career . I always enjoyed the smell scent odor aroma of a fresh brewed cuppa joe and after making a pot of the stuff every day for a thousand plus days I decided it was time for me to give the sludgy black stuff a try . It sucked , but as I ' ve always done with anything that was bad for me I kept at it until I developed a taste for it . Now , even though I still open my eyes at first light of day , I can ' t wake myself up anymore without the buzz of two and a half gallon sized mugs . My Doctor tells me that a couple of cups in the morning might actually be good for me it ' s the guys who drink twenty or thirty cups a day that have problems , but that ' s not the point . Actually , none of what I ' ve written so far is the point but that ' s what you get when your editor asks for a thousand words . The real point is that even after fifteen years I still have no idea how to make a decent pot of coffee .
