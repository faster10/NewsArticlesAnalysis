" We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy , but also with Fidel Castro " claims M . Hodges . " My commanding officer , Jimmy Hayworth , told me that she had to die , and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose . I had never killed a woman before , but I obeyed orders I did it for America ! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists , and we couldn ' t allow that ! She had to die ! I just did what I had to do ! "
