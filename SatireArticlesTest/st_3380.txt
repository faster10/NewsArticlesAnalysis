Hollywood , CA ( O ! Online ) Reporters for O ! Online have learned that there are plans in the works for a possible joint comeback tour for Britney Spears featuring Osama bin Laden . This comes after independent disastrous performances by both over this past weekend . Bin Laden had released his latest video , which has been universally panned by critics for its post editing flaws and obvious overdubbing and lip sync problems . A noticeably nervous Britney Spears was blasted last night for her performance in her long heralded comeback appearance on the MTV Video Music Awards . Spears was noted to suffer as well some of the same lip sync problems and lack of animation as displayed by bin Laden during her performance last night .
