" It was then that she says she called her travel agent and had him book her immediate passage to Kathmandu and then on to Lukla , where she could start from Everest base camp and begin the trek up the mountain . Surprisingly , Fiorina said she made the climb by herself , claiming she " needed to prove to the world that Carly Fiorina can literally do anything she wants , and live to tell you the tale later .
