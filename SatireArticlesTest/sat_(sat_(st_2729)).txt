" The term ' Oreo ' has been used for years to criticize African American behavior " , says Rachel Dolezal , the former Spokane , Washington NAACP chapter president outed last June for misrepresenting her ethnicity . " Sometimes this comes from members within our own community . I ' ve been called a ' Reverse Oreo ' many , many times , and now that I ' m pregnant , folks are calling me a Reverse Double Stuff Oreo . I can understand things from both sides of that woodpile , and Donald Trump is being straight up offensive ! "
