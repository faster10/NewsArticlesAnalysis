Conservative Christian Groups are up in arms about plans to display the Code of Hammurabi and the Magna Carta next to the Ten Commandments on some court house lawns . The idea of grouping together all the major codifications of the laws that shaped western society throughout the ages was meant to be a way to avoid labeling the Ten Commandments as a purely religious symbol , thereby quelling any uproar over their display on government properties . However , Christian groups are threatening legal action to ban the display of " Counter Christian Propaganda " , vowing to bring the matter all the way to the Supreme Court , at least as soon as President George W . Bush gets a chance to rid the bench of Liberal Justices .
