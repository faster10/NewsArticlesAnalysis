In many instances , said Gemelli , the funnels that formed failed to reach the ground , so technically ( and luckily for him and for members of his crew ) they weren ' t tornadoes , but conditions were present for cyclones to form . " Thunderstorms and hailstorms were also pretty common , " he added . " Although I haven ' t done research in areas outside the midwest , this phenomenon could happen in any part of the country , or the world . Tornadoes are forming in places where they never formed years ago , so it will be interesting to observe whether or not the silver lining variations happen in other areas , including coastal regions around the world , where hurricane activity is a concern .
