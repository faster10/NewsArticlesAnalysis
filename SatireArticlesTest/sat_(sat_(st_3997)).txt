Tonight ' s the night that Sarah Palin , the Republican Hillary Clinton , debates Barak Obama ' s running mate Joe Biden . Finally John McCain can prove once and for all to Hillary supporters that there ' s no difference between Governor Palin and Senator Clinton not in substance , basic intelligence , grasp of foreign policy , the economy , healthcare or even for that matter , military affairs . In fact , a vote for John McCain is really just like a vote for Hillary Clinton . Of course , John McCain has to die or stroke out for Sarah Palin to jump in , but still . By the end of this day at least Hillary supporters will know she ' s ready to step in at the drop of a bright orange hunting cap .
