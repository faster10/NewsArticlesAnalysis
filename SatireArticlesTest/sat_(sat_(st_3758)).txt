Well , the election is today and I ' m looking at the end of my Presidency . I wanted to write you a letter , since you don ' t always answer the phone anymore , both to talk about the last eight years and look forward to what comes next . I know that you both , but Mom especially , might be a little disappointed in my performance as President because it means Jeb won ' t get his turn , but I really did my best .
