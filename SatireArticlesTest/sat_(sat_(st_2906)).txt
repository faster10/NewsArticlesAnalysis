The point is , Aristotle once said , " Fear is pain arising from the anticipation of evil . " Global warming is that evil , and the pain we ' re feeling is the anticipation of that evil . If you combine that with another famous philosophical dictum , that the fear of a thing is worse than the thing itself , then we can deduce that dying from a climate induced pandemic won ' t be nearly as bad as the fear of dying of a climate induced pandemic . In other words , when the tidal wave hits or the food disappears or the starving polar bears come south and raid our daycare centers , or whatever , we ' ll be like , Oh , this is what I got so worked up about ? Silly me . " '
