According to the plan , " Perfect Citizen " would " embed surveillance probes in privately owned networks " , presumably banks and utility companies and such , looking for suspicious behavior . Still all well and good after all , these would be the most likely targets of a cyber attack and a successful breach would cause massive chaos . But given the abundance of privately owned computer security companies and firewalls , is a massive governmental surveillance even needed ? And anyway , " Perfect Citizen " is not a firewall , it ' s a spy tool on it ' s own it wouldn ' t stop a hack attack it would be just looking around to see what ' s out there .
