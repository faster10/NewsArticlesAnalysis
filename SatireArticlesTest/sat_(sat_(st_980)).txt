" We want players to get a real feel of what it ' s like to run an ICU fresh out of medical school , " stated Tom Chesterfield , Ubisoft designer . " Players will be given the options of whether or not to return pages , call for backup , study , listen or disregard seasoned ICU nurse advice , or turn the pager off , say it and grab a sandwich . We tried really hard to give people those same tough decisions faced by MICU residents every day . "
