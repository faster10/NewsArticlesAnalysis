" No one at BBC2 and no one on the Top Gear staff considered it to be serious , but Piers Morgan ' s tweets may have landed him the biggest gig of his career , " said one BBC staffer . " I think he only meant it in jest , but it was enough for the big wigs to say hey , Piers Morgan isn ' t really doing anything right now , maybe we can grab him . ' I can ' t think of anything that would be more insulting to Jeremy Clarkson or his fans than replacing him with someone like Piers Morgan . Maybe that ' s why they ' re doing it . "
