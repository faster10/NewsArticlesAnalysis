The biological behavior of fibrous alveolar keloidal enchondroma , also known as " Platt ' s tumor , " has yet to be studied . " It is believed to be benign , " says Dr Weissinger , " despite a potentially high risk of local recurrence and metastasis . In order to rule out FAKE , I recommend a broad panel of immunohistochemical markers , including pan cytokeratin , vimentin , S100 , CK7 , CK20 , beta catenin , desmin , smooth muscle actin , myogenin , p63 , synaptophysin , chromogranin , ER , PR , CD3 , CD5 , CD10 , CD20 , brachyury , TFE3 , and INI 1 .
