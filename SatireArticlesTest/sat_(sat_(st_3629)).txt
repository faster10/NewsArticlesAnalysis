Bush : Well the story is about this fellow and I always have trouble with names it started with an M French sounding and he smoked a lot we ' ll call him Marlboro . This guy Marlboro finds out one day that his Mee Maw died , that ' s how the book starts , it says , " Mee Maw died today " . You can tell that he ' s pretty broken up about it because he doesn ' t show it , but nobody else seems to get it .
