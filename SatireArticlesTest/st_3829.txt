There ' s a certain cachet to having " Governor of California or New York ( respectively ) " written on your tombstone , I get that ( I ' ll have " Another Poor Useless Schmuck " on mine ) . Hubris is another reason thinking because you made money in business you can run a state . Of course , that ' s like me thinking because I ' m a carpenter , I can build a space shuttle . Maybe I could too , if I had a lifetime ' s worth of proper training , but right now ? No . ( Hey , did you know there ' s not one nail in a space shuttle ? Amazing . )
