I see that you look a bit uncomfortable . There ' s really no need to recoil from Henry like that . It looks like all he wants to do is whisper something into your ear . Maybe he wants to share a secret with you . That ' s very impressive Henry doesn ' t usually share secrets with people this quickly . He ' s been trained to establish at least some kind of rapport before telling people about important personal secrets , like that time he worked for the special forces .
