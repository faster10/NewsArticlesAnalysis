" It ' s like when you point to an electrical outlet and say to your baby , ' No ! ' You ' re teaching him not to play with dangerous things , " said the Rev . Marilyn Beecher , a minister in Melbourne , Australia . " Maybe God is warning us not to play with Jupiter . Maybe Jupiter is electrical . Or poisonous . Or maybe it bites . Whatever the case , I think a big ' Thank you , God ! ' is in order . "
