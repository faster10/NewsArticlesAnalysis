Malouf is a software engineer with ten years experience in the IT industry , and is hoping to apply that experience as a new business owner in Grace . He intends to start a computer repair and education center where people of all income levels can come and learn how to use various high tech devices . " The idea , " Malouf said , " is that if we give people the tools to update their technical skills , they may qualify for higher paying office jobs and thereby help our local economy and give the social safety net a little breathing room . " Malouf says he already has the capital in place , and just needs a home to set up his Tennessee residence in to begin the process .
