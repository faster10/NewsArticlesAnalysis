She went on to describe the quality of the culinary options : " The food service was TERRIBLE ! Everything had to be ordered from room service ' . I tried to order a pizza from Papa John ' s , but the staff wouldn ' t allow the delivery guy up to my room . They wouldn ' t even let my family or friends bring food to me . Who cares if I ' m having surgery in the morning ? ? ? This is AMERICA , it ' s a free country ! That ' s how capitalism works , COMPETITION ! And whenever I did order from room service , half the stuff on the menu was not available ' . Something about being on a heart healthy ' diet hey Ratatouille , I already HAD my quadruple bypass ! I can have greasy food again now if I want to . " "
