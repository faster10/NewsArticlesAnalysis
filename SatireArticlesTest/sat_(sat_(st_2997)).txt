Nigel T . , Massachusetts : " Usually my fantasy goes like this : my wife comes home from work and she gets on the Mac and it ' s acting kind of slow and she says , Nigel , did you install the latest Airport update ? ' and I come in the room and say No dear ' and she throws me over her knee and shouts Bad boy ! Bad boy . " ' and starts spanking me with a 6 pin FireWire cable . And in my fantasy I never use our safe word , which is QuickTime . " '
