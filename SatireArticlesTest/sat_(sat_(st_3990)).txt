( On Feminists ) So I would like to see , perhaps , some of these feminist women and sometimes , you know , I consider myself , too , as a feminist , whatever that means . In fact , I subscribe to Feminists for Life . I ' m a pro life woman who wants to make sure that , you know , we cherish the sanctity of life . And this group , Feminists for Life , sort of encapsulates all that I believe in with that with the pro life movement . "
