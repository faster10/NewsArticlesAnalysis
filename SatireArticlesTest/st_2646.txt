" Back in 2004 , President Bush laid out his vision for a return to the moon , followed by a manned mission to Mars . That was ten , eleven , years ago . When Kennedy did that , we got to the Moon inside of what , nine years ? And here we are , eleven years later , and we haven ' t been back to the moon , and we haven ' t done anything to even try to get there . In fact , President Obama retired our space shuttle , so you might say he ' s been actively trying to not ' get us to the Moon . History is going to remember this as one of the many terrible failures of this presidency . History books will forever remember Obama ' s crimes against scientific opportunity and advancement . "
