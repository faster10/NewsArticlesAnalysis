I didn ' t ask to come to America . I liked things at home , the limited news coverage and resources and lack of clean water . I had a nice routine going , you know ? I thrived in it . Sleep in , infect a few people , go to bed . I felt well traveled between Guinea , Liberia , and Sierra Leone . But here ? America ' s so far from home . I ' m not used to things here in the States . It ' s really hard . I can ' t get into any kind of virulent rhythm What ' s that ? Yes , there are extra gloves in the back
