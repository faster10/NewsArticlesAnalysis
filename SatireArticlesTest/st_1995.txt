" Every child ' s dream is to one day get paid to not do the job they ' ve wanted all their life , " Boehner said . " For some kids it ' s not playing center field for their favorite baseball team , for other kids it ' s not acting in front of lights and cameras , and other kids just have humble dreams of not working for their family ' s shop one day , or not working at the local factory not producing things that Americans need . " Boehner says that his lifelong dream was always to be an elected official who didn ' t do his job but still got a paycheck and he " did that in spades . "
