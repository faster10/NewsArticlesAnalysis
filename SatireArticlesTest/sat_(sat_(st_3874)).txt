Anyway , with what seemed like perfect logic to me , she shipped him off to the Nuns . Having been sentenced to 12 years of Catholic school myself in my younger days , I was well aware of what lay ahead for the poor kid . But hey , it was for his own good . A yard stick across the back never hurt anyone well , it hurt me , but that ' s beside the point . So imagine my surprise when I saw her not long ago and she told me the kid was back in public school . I asked her why .
