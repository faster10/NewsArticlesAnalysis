Turns out on September 11 , 2012 at Wexnar Medical Center in Columbus , OH , OR 5 had a significant anesthesia delay . They struggled to get an arterial line , suggested they needed 2 more large bore IVs . Eventually , when anesthesia couldn ' t get the extra IV access , the first year anesthesia resident proceeded to struggle in placing a central line . This mandatory anesthesia mess around time lasted almost 5 times longer than normal , a clear link to Al Qaeda and their attack on the American consulate .
