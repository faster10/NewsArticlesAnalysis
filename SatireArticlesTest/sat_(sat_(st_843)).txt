" I was a seventh year resident in Neurosurgery when the opportunity for an iRheum fellowship came knocking at my door . Literally , someone knocked on my door one night and there was a flyer for the program on the floor with freshly baked cookies on top . You know , the ability to stamp out some of these diseases bring social justice to the injustice that society has brought upon patients who suffer from these diseases , and that is a disease in it itself . Plus , who says no to fresh cookies ! "
