The Bush Department of Justice ( DOJ ) , in a backdoor move has found a novel way to help Alaska Senator Ted Steven ' s win his bribery trial . Realizing that 90 of them will be out of a job in January if Barak Obama wins the presidential election or conversely , that no one ' s gonna be axed if John McCain wins , they ' ve decided to throw the trial . Also , having Ted Steven ' s in his seat to vote against any investigation of them would be a pretty good idea .
