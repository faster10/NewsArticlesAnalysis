Now critics are complaining about the President ' s order to secretly spy on thousands of US citizens and residents in the US without search warrants . The president ordered the National Security Agency to spy on anyone in the US because he ' s the boss . All we have to do is trust him and his neo con advisors , who wouldn ' t dream of using these laws against critics like Valerie Wilson , political opponents like John McCain , or those in his own party who oppose his policies , like Richard Clarke . And he doesn ' t have to explain the process : The Supreme Court appointed him president , didn ' t they ?
