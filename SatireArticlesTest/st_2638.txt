Cruz , while speaking at a conservative breakfast conference a few blocks from Capitol Hill , embraced what he called " the spirit and the mojo " of the OWS movement , while distancing himself from their tactics . His goal , according to Cruz himself , is to " re envision , rebuild , re embolden , and reenergize " OWS , and in a room full of nearly two hundred conservative congressmen , senators , and donors , he wasn ' t afraid to let his audience know that they ' d need to start fundraising for an OWS rebirth immediately .
