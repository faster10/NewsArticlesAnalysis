" This is a huge opportunity for John Kerry . " Says the shrill Paul Krugmen . " I have to say I ' m very surprised at the apparent disorganization of the Presidents re election team . I figured that the only way Kerry was going to win was if he won the Electoral College and the popular vote walking away . I mean a real landslide of 8 to 10 points to keep the election safe from post election day chicanery . It now appears that he may be able to win by just a few points and still not lose the election afterward . The Bush ' s have left a real opening here . It will be interesting to see if John Kerry can take advantage of it . "
