To make matters worse , medical providers are beginning to encounter more unusual cases of pain scale misuse . This year alone , three cases in the literature describe patients with pain rated as the letters M , S , or V on the scale from 0 to 10 . The strangest case to date describes a healthy 26 year old female patient presenting to an emergency room with negative pain ( 3 out of 10 ) . She was requesting pain stimulants to bring her pain level up to 0 . This case will be presented at the next American Academy of Pain Medicine meeting .
