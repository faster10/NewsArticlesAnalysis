" Also , what people don ' t understand is that I never wanted to be known as Sneezy , " Sneezy stated later at the press conference . " Once I moved in with the other dwarves , I played along because that was the name I was given . However , I was teased and bullied all the time by my colleagues . No one wanted to sit , stand , or work near me because they were afraid they would catch something . While I may have looked cheerful in the movie , rest assured that off the set , I was very depressed and I went to bed crying every night . "
