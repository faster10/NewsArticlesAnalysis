We put the same first question to Linda . After a moment she said she knew about Madonna . " Madonna moved from her native Michigan to New York in 1977 , with dreams of becoming a ballet dancer . She studied with choreographer Alvin Ailey and modeled . In 1979 , she became part of the Patrick Hernandez Revue , a disco outfit who had the hit " Born to Be Alive . " She traveled to Paris with Hernandez it was there that she met Dan Gilroy , who would soon become her boyfriend " We stopped her there , and asked her , as we did Jane , " Who is the Vice President of the United States ? "
