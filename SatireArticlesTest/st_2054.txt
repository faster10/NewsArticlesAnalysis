Ryan said that " it ' s just not fair " that he and his fellow conservative Christian Americans will " have to face the same kind of scrutiny , generalizations and discrimination " they have " insisted that Muslims live under since 9 11 . " In his words , Ryan said that it ' s " obvious that Muslims are more dangerous in general , even though more people have died in right wing extremist attacks in this country since 9 11 than in Islamic terror attacks . " Ryan said though , that he ' s most " disgusted with the liberal media " for comparing the Planned Parenthood shooting to that of the attacks in Paris , France a couple of weeks ago .
