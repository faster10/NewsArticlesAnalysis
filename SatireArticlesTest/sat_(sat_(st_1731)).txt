I do in fact remember your family . Over a year ago , we kicked in your daughter ' s door and saved her in the nick of time before she succumbed to the effects of The Phish and the drug smoke that perfumed her room . Thank you for your generous donations . My ministry to rid society of jamband influences ( especially The Phish ) is becoming more and more difficult . Expenses continue to rise in the form of ticket prices , travel , and meals abroad as I investigate and report on these demonic groups . I can assure you that your money is going to good use .
