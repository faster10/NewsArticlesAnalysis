Whether or not Bush receives the Republican nomination will be a factor as to whether the plan can work . Dean reiterated several times that over the months leading up to the primaries , Clinton will steer clear of debasing Jeb Bush , but focus on the extreme positions of fellow GOP candidates Ted Cruz , Rick Perry , Scott Walker , Ted Nugent , Sarah Palin , Donald Trump and , in particular , former US Ambassador and GOP curmudgeon John Bolton . She is hoping that her repeated referrals to Walker and Cruz will " stir up the Tea Party , " as Dean put it several times . With Tea Party activists and conservative radio talk show hosts enraged at Clinton , they will rally the most conservative voters ( who are more likely to vote in the Republican primaries ) to lead Walker or Cruz to the nomination , leaving Bush well behind in the running . Following that , Clinton will start to praise the moderation of the Bush campaign , showing signs of potential compatibility . If Bush bows out early , Team Clinton will immediately start to stoke the fire of adulation on how well Jeb handled himself and that he was " treated unfairly . "
