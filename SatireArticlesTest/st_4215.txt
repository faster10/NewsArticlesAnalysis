In the name of protecting your freedom , George Bush has authorized the NSA to read your emails , listen to your phone calls , sneak in and search your house without ever telling you it happened . They want to know what websites you visit , what books you buy or borrow from your library ( which has somewhat surprisingly placed several meek and mild mannered librarians smack in the front lines of the battle to maintain your right to privacy ) . And don ' t for a minute think it won ' t happen to you . If it can happen to one , it can happen to all , eventually .
