Cruz told reporters after the rally that while he " respects the douche level that Trump has brought " to the campaign so far , he himself is " far more douchey , for more often " and therefore is the " right douche and the right time " for Republican voters . " Who else has led a shutdown of the federal government over a hissy fit they threw about giving poor people access to doctors and medicine , " Cruz asked as proof of his " supreme douchy ness . " He pointed to the fact that " within ten minutes of arriving in D . C . " had " managed to make everyone in his own party hate him " as more evidence that he is the " douchebag the Republican base really wants to vote for . "
