This I agree with anyone who kills you , ( as Robertson would kill Chavez ) " do such things because they have not known the Father . " It ' s an odd passage to quote , given the topic . Rev . Messiah also mentions that while George Bush did nothing , Pat Robertson ' s group was right there delivering hurricane relief . Good for them , although I don ' t know if they were in New Orleans helping the poor impoverished Blacks abandoned there or if they were just concentrating on their own people . I do hope they helped the Muslims , Pagans and Jews caught there , turbines or not . Messiah also does seem to agree that Robertson should have kept his stupid mouth shut apparently he wanted the assassination thing to be a surprise . However , he does think that there are various types of murder killing Chavez is alright but killing me is bad . I thank him for that I was a little worried . But Chavez is not a self proclaimed enemy of the US . More correctly , Chavez is George Bush ' s enemy . Republicans don ' t like Socialists in their backyard it makes em look bad . He also suggests I go to Venezuela and write bad things about Chavez . If I was a Venezuelan , didn ' t like Chavez and could speak or write Spanish I like to think I would . I ' m pretty up front about my feelings for Bush and probably have an FBI file because of it , even though I ' m a depressingly law abiding citizen . We ' ll see how long I last here .
