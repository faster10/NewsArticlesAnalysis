I should talk about our corporate culture . Let me tell you , it is really , really great . It ' s true that our Corporate Culture Manifesto forbids employees from partaking in any outside cultural activities , but that ' s only because our internal corporate culture makes up for it . We believe in inclusion , equality , active participation , innovation , and mandatory tattoos of our company logo . After receiving lots of feedback and several class action lawsuits , we no longer require our logo tattoos to be located on your face or neck .
