According to Michael Banio of Great Britain ' s Royal Astronomical Society , asteroid " 2001 YB5 passed within 375 , 000 miles of Earth on Monday , but it was still too far away for useful studies to be conducted . And because YB5 was not discovered until December , scientists did not have time to prepare for its arrival . However , using electron particle impulses emitted by a modified NASA satellite early this morning , British and American astrophysicists said they successfully nudged the next asteroid , a kilometer wide giant they ' ve labeled 2002 CUL8R , directly into Earth ' s path .
