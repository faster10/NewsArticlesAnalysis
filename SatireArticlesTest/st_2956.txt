OK , so that ' s settled . Wait , stay away ' is another way to put it . Stay away from anything Facebook is involved in , or thinking of getting involved in . Which is pretty much everything . You think you might go into photo sharing like Picasa ? I ' m already doing that . Video streaming like YouTube ? Doing that too . The coupon Grouon business ? Nope . I ' m there already . Pretty much . What about hardware ? That would be safe . Except you ' d be competing with me and the Open Compute Project I ' ve set up . And if you go up against me you will be crushed , and your 200 , 000 educations will be wasted because my PR people will hunt you down and spread rumors about you and your malformed startups that will make your fathers cry and your mothers ill and your siblings shred your baby pictures and your friends slap your grandparents for having your parents for having you .
