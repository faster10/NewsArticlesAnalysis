We all get stressed out and frustrated at times . Sometimes it ' s due to work sometimes it ' s due to other things . When that happens , the best thing to do is ignore yourself and bottle those emotions tightly , keeping them suppressed for as long as possible , until the right unpredictable moment in the future when some insignificant thing causes you to snap and break down into an inconsolable ball of sadness and tears . It ' s totally unhealthy that ' s why we recommend it !
