To some it may sound funny to praise the Pope and then immediately buy more guns , but it makes perfect sense when you realize who we are going to use the guns on . We are going to kill Arabs with those guns , for Christ sake ! We are going to defend Christianity from those godless oil smeared heathens in the Middle East with those guns . We are going to make the world safe for our children and our children ' s children with those guns . What could be more Christian then that ?
