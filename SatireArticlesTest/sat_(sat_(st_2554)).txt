Do you think for one minute your automobile won ' t be ransacked the moment you leave it alone in the parking lot at a The Phish show ? Don ' t leave anything of value in your car . Kiss that after show beer and cooler goodbye . While walking in to the festival grounds , do you not see the vagrant type trolls that meander along the path begging for a " miracle " or offering up sexual favors for a coveted concert ticket ? Check the souvenir booth and you ' ll find glazed eyed zealots coveting sold out tour posters and cheaply stitched t shirts . You ' ll experience the draw of envy at a The Phish concert because the groupthink is so overwhelming . Your awful lawn seats will cause great apprehension as you watch other phans file into the pavilion .
