According to numerous realtors in and around Binghamton , New York , Notch has been buying up commercial and industrial properties in the city of Binghamton itself , as well as approximately 9 square miles of land a few miles north of Binghamton , not far from Interstate 81 . His goal for this property is to build a massive theme park inspired by the hit indie game " Minecraft " for which Notch is famous , where players of all ages explore an Earth sized planet fighting zombies and building cabins and castles out of 1 meter cubes of dirt , stone , wood , and other resources .
