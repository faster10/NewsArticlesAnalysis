" I must apologize , " Huckabee told the press after a rally in Connard , Iowa , " I come from a simpler time . A time of guns , gravy , God , and unrepentant racial stereotypes . I truly meant no offense to Americans , just to North Koreans , and maybe any other Asian type that eats dogs . " Huckabee insisted that his joke " wouldn ' t have even been looked at twice twenty years ago " and that " the liberal lamestream media " wouldn ' t let up on him until he apologized .
