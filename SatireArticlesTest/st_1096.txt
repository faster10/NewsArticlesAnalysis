When asked for a comment , Dr Cannon , eminent surgeon , veteran of many many surgeries , and president of the American College of Surgeons , stabbed his scalpel through a copy of the New England Journal of Medicine and then , cackling replied , " Studies ? Studies ? I don ' t need no stinking studies , I have genuine true to god fearing experience to guide me . I ' ve been doing this for 30 years . Ask me how many Whipples I ' ve done . Go ahead ask . Ask ! "
