" I do not believe it is wrong to criticize the war on terror or any aspect of the Iraq war that is on the approved list . " Said Cheney . " What is not legitimate , and what I will again say is dishonest and reprehensible , is the suggestion by some U . S . senators that the president . . . misled the American people on prewar intelligence . That topic is not on the approved list and discussion of it is revisionism of the most corrupt and shameless variety . Discussions of other topics , not on the list , will certainly have an insidious effect on the war effort itself . "
