Follow the alternate side of the street parking signs : it ' s a pain in the butt , but there ' re good reasons for it . Fire trucks and ambulances can ' t get through our narrow streets with cars parked on both sides , so you may one day end up being responsible for the immolation death of some pretty young coed who couldn ' t get out of her house in time because the rescue guys couldn ' t get through and it ' ll weigh on you for the rest of your worthless life until you become so consumed with secret remorse that you ' ll blow your brains out in front of your children . And in the Winter trucks can ' t plow with you ' re stupid Mitsubishi Eclipses parked on the wrong side of the street cause you were too stoned or uncaring to move it across the road .
