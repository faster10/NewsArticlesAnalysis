" Mr President , the treasury is broke . The war and tax breaks to the wealthy cleaned it out . You spent every last cent . Secretary of the Treasury , John Snow , is in New Zealand seeking political asylum . The USA has been downgraded to ' deadbeat nation ' by the IMF . This rating is below that of Haiti and Rwanda . I ' m so sorry , really sorry , Mr President ! but I ' m sure that your friend , Rush Limbaugh , can put you and Laura up at his Florida Estate . "
