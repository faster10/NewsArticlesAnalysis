" Dude , I saw Wide spread Panic in Colorado last year at Telluride , which would have been the highlight of my life if I ' d only had a joint to smoke at the start of the guitar solo of ' Love Tractor ' , " said fan Winston " Wildhorse " Breneman about the last Widespread Panic show he saw . " I was totally sober , so I can ' t be sure that it was as good as it could have been , so we ' ll just put it up with one of those ' off night ' shows . "
