According to Gachette , he and the NRA executives " most definitely want " to " find a solution to our gun problem that doesn ' t end in a war between gun nuts and citizens who just want common sense gun reforms put in place , " but that " the sinister liberal , gun grabbing agenda of the president and his other thugs " is preventing that . " So what other choice will the country have than to start murdering each other over our right to have completely unfettered and unchecked access to implements of murder ? I mean , are you really suggesting we could be adults , bring our differences to the table , hash out the stuff we can ' t ever agree on , and then just work on solutions we could agree on , " Gachette said .
