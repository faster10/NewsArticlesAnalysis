According to Shear , the sales tax increase will affect most citizens however there are a few groups that will currently fall within an exempt status . Any citizen that resides in Alaska , Montana , New Hampshire , Delaware , or Oregon will temporarily be exempt from the tax as their respective states do not currently require its citizens to pay sales tax . Shear claims that the president is currently looking for additional avenues citizens of the above mentioned states can contribute and is looking at increased property tax as a viable option .
