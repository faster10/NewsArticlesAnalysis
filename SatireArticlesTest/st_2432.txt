" I was confused when I arrived here in town and within ten minutes I heard gunshots , " Malouf said . Gunshots are something he says he had become very accustomed to hearing , but he said he he didn ' t know what to make of the ones he heard in the small Arkansas town he had been settled in by the refugee placement program . His fears were quickly assuaged by a man he saw walking down the street , seemingly unaware of the gun fire ringing out in the street . " I stopped him and asked him why he wasn ' t ducking for cover , " Malouf told us , " then he reassured me it was just two American citizens exercising their Second Amendment rights to end disputes with murdering each other , as the Founding Fathers intended . " Malouf said he knew then and there " that this American war zone would be much different than the one in Syria he left behind . "
