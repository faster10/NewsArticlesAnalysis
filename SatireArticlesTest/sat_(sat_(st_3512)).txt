There ' s also a cyber security bill up for vote in the Senate that would give " the president the authority to seize control of their networks in an emergency . " Again , it ' s a question of what " an emergency " would be . George Bush shut down all flights after 9 11 I could see the logic of that . But say we had the net in 1973 when the Washington Post was breaking the story of Nixon and Watergate I have no doubt that Tricky Dick would have manufactured an " emergency " to shut down the web to keep that story quiet . That ' s where the problem is .
