Unnamed Tea Party Source Wegman ( Pudgy ) Waterhouse , speaking on the condition of anonymity , explained , " Members of the Tea Party always insist they ' re not members of a " Tea Party " . That ' s how you know em . Because , you see , the Tea Party is not a Party , it ' s a Movement that just happens to be called a Party because it has the word Party in it ' s name , but it ' s not . A Party , that is . It ' s a Movement well , maybe it ' s a little of both , a Movement and a Party or a Marty , if you will . Anyway , if you say you ' re not a member of the Tea Party , then you are one . By the same token , if you say you are a member , you ' re not . "
