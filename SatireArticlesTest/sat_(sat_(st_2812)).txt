Raduljica was not alone . Lithuanian head coach Jude Zdovc , whom the USA beat in the semi final , called USA ' s effort a " disgrace to the sport , " in his post game press conference . " I looked out on the court and saw guys from the NBA , THE NBA ! I don ' t see why they needed to try so hard . They could have came and did some passing exercises but instead they were dunking and setting actual screens . I actually saw sweat on some of those guys . I don ' t know why we bothered ! "
