" It was an intense ordeal . I was shaking for an hour , " said Jim Gray , the campaign staffer who had accompanied Marco Rubio on the fateful trip to Phoenix . " I ' m white , so they didn ' t ask me for ID . Actually , one of them offered to buy me a beer and asked me if I ' d been kidnapped . They let me fire off a couple rounds from their pistol , too they were swell guys . But what they did to Senator Rubio was shocking . Patriotic , heroic , and American as all hell , but shocking . "
