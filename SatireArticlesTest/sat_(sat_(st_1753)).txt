Former classmate Alex Tupper remembers the constant taunts pitched at Roof . " Oh , he had a different nickname every year : Wedge head , Mopsy Topsy , Shaggie Maggie , Dick Toothbrush . ' I think the last straw was in ninth grade when everyone just started calling him Miranda from Sex in The City . He never fought back , he just would get mad and stomp away and everybody would chant , ' Storm off ! Through the Roof ! Storm off ! Through the Roof ! ' Kids can be so cruel . " Records indicate Roof repeated the ninth grade , but it is not known whether he graduated .
