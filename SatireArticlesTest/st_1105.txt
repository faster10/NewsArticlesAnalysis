Mr J . Lewis glowingly describes his experience : " My doctors laughed at me for 25 years and told me I was a hypochondriac or had somatization disorder . I kept telling them I had a sticking feeling on my left side that would come and go for 30 seconds . It felt like a little troll lived inside me and was sticking me with prongs . CT scans , MRIs , and endoscopies were all normal . At Google Medical Center , I quickly discovered I had either a splenic laceration or an accessory splenule all this time . Either way , my spleen was removed 2 days after I walked through the door . Who ' s laughing now ?
