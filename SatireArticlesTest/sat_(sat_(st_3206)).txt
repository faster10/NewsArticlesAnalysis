In the end it doesn ' t matter what any of you think . I know deep down in where my heart would be that one day Manti and I will be together again , for the first time . I know this because not only was I " made for him , but he was made for me . That ' s right , Manti Te ' o is fictional . If you think about it , you know it ' s true . That would explain why he didn ' t show up at the hospital , or at my funeral , or for the Notre Dame Alabama game .
