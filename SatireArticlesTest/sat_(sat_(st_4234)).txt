Well , I gotta go take care the sub prime mortgage crisis , which was Alan Greenspan ' s fault , I admit it , but I ' d sure appreciate it if you could get back to me as soon as you can . Laura and I will be outta town for Christmas , but I ' m pretty sure they ' ll forward your reply to me . They always tell me the bad stuff , even if there ' s nothing I can do about it . I think they do it on purpose .
