" Miss Alexis Wormwood , my grade one teacher , read us a story about a poor girl who was walking through the forest one day and found a frog , " tells the girl , in between bouts of vomiting . " She kissed it , and it turned into a prince and she became a princess ! I want to be a princess too , so I went into the forest behind my grade school and looked for my prince . I found a frog and kissed him , but nothing happened . So I kissed him again and again , but I guess it was a girl frog because she didn ' t turn into a prince . I went home after that and the next day I was all hot and sore and I have to poop a lot . "
