If you ' re a Republican these days you ' re part of a war . Not the military war in Iraq or Afghanistan , although that ' s certainly a part of it , but a greater war for the moral and spiritual control of the nation , if not the world . Forget fiscal conservatism , because the leaders in this war are committed to spending however many billions or trillions of dollars it takes to win this war . Sure , in exchange for your support they won ' t raise your federal income taxes , no . That would be wrong .
