Senator Neil Downes ( R Madison ) told Conservative Frontline after the AGP attack last week , " I believe that , nationwide , we ' ve created these gay free zones so activists like Randy Peters that want to be a martyr for their cause are attracted to them because they know that they ' re going to be more successful in whatever form of terrorism that they are trying to accomplish . " He continued , " So when we label a gay free zone , we actually create some sort of sick arena for those people who obviously aren ' t going to follow the law . "
