Further into the letter Dennis states , " After weeks of abuse I was finally able to determine that the only wrong I had committed in Phillips ' eyes was being born in the south . Phillips is an avid , and extremely vocal Obama supporter . He was always talking about how amazing President Obama is , and how he wished Obama could be president forever . He would also try to bully the other employees into agreeing with his left wing political beliefs . I identify as a conservative , but I ' ve never thought politics were an appropriate workplace topic . I did what I could to ignore Jack Phillips ' preaching . Eventually , Phillips was strutting around the office , making jokes about " rednecks " , and always being sure to say it within ' earshot of me . "
