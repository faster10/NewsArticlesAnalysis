" We need to make spending cuts that not everyone will be happy with , but we need to come up with solutions that make up for those cuts , too .

We ' re talking billions and billions of dollars here . That ' s an innovative idea right there , and I just came up with it on the spot . That ' s what I want to bring to the White House . "
