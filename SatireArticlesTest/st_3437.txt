After apologizing for the fact that he had spent his twenties and thirties screwing around and getting stoned rather than taking computer classes , this reporter further queried Waterhouse as to whether the fact that he didn ' t exist may hurt his chances of winning anything , Waterhouse , now speaking on the condition that this reporter create a twenty two year old Swedish masseuse named Inga for him to have an affair with said , " Actually , no candidate for president since Eisenhower has actually existed and none ever will again , not in American politics . I ' m mean sure , having a face to photograph is an advantage , but as for policies or beliefs or any of that crap , they ' re all just as much of a fantasy as I am . We ' re all just a creation of whoever pays the most .

At least you imagined a boyishly good looking , tall , tanned and toned fictional character I ' d have really been pissed if you made me look like Newt Gingrich . "
