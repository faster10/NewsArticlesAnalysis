" Bernie Sanders , on the other hand , is currently the only other voice Democrats are now hearing beside Hillary ' s . He is smart , considerate and not in the pocket of a wealthy donor or Super PAC . More than that , he is a proud liberal , a Socialist , and far to the left of Hillary on practically every issue . If he can at least move her as far to the left as possible , it may be the only chance the Republicans have . The more liberal the Democratic candidate , the better chance that our candidate can appeal to the center . All Republican donors must heed the call : Donate heavily to Bernie Sanders ! He is the one who can take down Hillary . His voice and ideas must be heard throughout the long campaign season . Once he is quieted , the media ' s love affair with the Clintons will continue . Bernie forces her to move closer to his populist message . "
