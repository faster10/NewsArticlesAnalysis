Some folks in Jackson are not happy with the attention seeking pastor and have accused Jardon of using the church as his personal bully pulpit to preach political propaganda and hate speech . " If the church wants to preach politics , let them start paying taxes , " says Lou Sanus , a local LGBT activist and freelance writer for the Jackson Action . " Pastor Jardon is a hate mongering , right wing bigot who is currently under federal investigation for fraud , with known ties to various racist and anti government organizations . " Lou is not surprised Jardon ' s church would pull a publicity stunt for a Donald Trump visit , " These idiots are painting themselves orange , just let that sink in for a minute . "
