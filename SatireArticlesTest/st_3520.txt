But this year , when I got the call from Hef , it was almost my 45th birthday . The Republican party had just received a humpin ' , so I thought , " Wow at 45 , America doesn ' t want us anymore ? " And I thought it ' s almost an epiphany like a " F ' em all ! " moment . I feel empowered that you can criticize other people ' s morals and yet still be single , with no children , sexy and confident , and then bare all for the world .
