Mr Kahn said at first he didn ' t " trust the media ' s narrative " about mass shootings , so he checked the FBI ' s website , and found that indeed the number of mass killings and active shooter events has been rising sharply in recent years . " I just had no idea how frequent spree shootings were happening in this country , " Kahn said , " and once you see the numbers it just becomes too much to process after awhile . So I ' m giving myself a full reprieve from it all until the next shooting happens . "
