" In most cases , the emotional support animal is a common domesticated beast like a cat or dog , " said Professor Kendra White speaking on behalf of the Foundation For A Better Tomorrow . " We ' re beginning to see people use some pretty strange animals that they ' re trying to claim as an emotional support animal . I ' m not sure how a pig is able to really help someone with their emotional issues . In the case up in South Dakota , I ' m not sure what that woman was thinking walking through a heavily wooded area with an unleashed deer during hunting season . I don ' t fault the hunter at all and think the lawsuit is unreasonable and disgusting . "
