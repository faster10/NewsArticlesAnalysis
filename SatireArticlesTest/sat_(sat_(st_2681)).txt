" You simply have not lived until you have taken the stage on a dark night with a massive flaming T behind you , and you look out and see a throng of hooded sycophants chanting your name , " Trump told the press . " It ' s really quite awe inspiring , and I hope that everyone understands and appreciates not just me , but what my campaign is and what it represents when they go to the ballot boxes next year . I ' m the winner everyone wants to win , and I will win as long as you loser ass losers remember that . God Bless Trump ! "
