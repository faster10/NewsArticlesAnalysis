Vice Admiral Richard H . Carmona , M . D . , F . A . C . S . , H . M . F . I . C . , the 17th surgeon general of the United States , warns that the Bird Flu virus is especially dangerous because it can be contracted not only from eating contaminated chicken but also from exchanging bodily fluids with an infected individual before that individual becomes symptomatic . " Fortunately , there ' s little danger of contracting the virus from persons who are already symptomatic , " Carmona said , " because only a pervert would find that sort of behavior attractive . "
