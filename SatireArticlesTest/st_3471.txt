Of course , it ' s not just Asian males that evoke some kind of biased based response . I can ' t look at a kid in baggy rapper clothes and a parka without figuring that he ' s carrying a Glock 9mm or at least a Colt and will start spraying lead wildly if I happen to beat him to a parking space at the mall ( come to think of it , I can ' t look at any eight year old school kid , girl or boy , without feeling that they ' re quietly planning out how to blow away the principal and a janitor or two at the local grammar school ) .
