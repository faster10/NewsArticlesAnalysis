This isn ' t the first time an act of violence occurred on the set of The Dare . On July 4th , while filming the show ' s second episode , a Missouri man was brutally beaten by several of his neighbors after decorating his lawn with pro Obama items , flying a large British Flag from his porch , and wearing a T shirt that read " f NASCAR ! " in big bold letters while putting it all up . That man spent four days in the hospital , and was only paid 25 , 000 , having only completed his second dare .
