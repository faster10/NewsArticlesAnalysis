Can it be stopped ? Sure it ' s easy too . Vote . Vote against the people who would foster anger and intolerance . Vote to allow the civil rights of every American , whether you agree with them or not , to be protected . Vote to work together , for reasoned debate and compromise . Vote to support the man we elected in the first place , not punish him for trying . Expect mistakes , missteps and outright failures , but also expect new ideas , possible solutions and successes . We ' re all in uncharted territory here and dangerously close to falling off the edge of the world . If you believe we can finally succeed , vote . Please .
