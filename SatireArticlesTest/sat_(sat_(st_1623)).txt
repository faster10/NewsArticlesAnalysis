Justin Watson , a mechanic in Albany , New York , has dealt with two of the twenty six " tampon Mazdas " himself . " Whenever I get a 2015 Mazda 6 , even if it ' s just for an oil change , I sigh and look under the engine cover , " says Watson . " You can tell when a Mazda 6 is a tampon Mazda ' because there ' s usually a little bit of string sticking out from the top of the cylinder . They don ' t always have it , but I found that twice now , out of four cars . I ' m guessing I ' ll find more , too . "
