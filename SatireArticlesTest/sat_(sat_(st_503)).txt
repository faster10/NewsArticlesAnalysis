" It ' s not like I agree with what he ' s saying , I just think it ' s hilarious , " said John Bowden , 16 , of Forest Hills , NY . " Replacing the super serious and overplayed Martin Luther King Jr . ' s memorable quote ' I Have a Dream ' with the national anthem of the Third Reich ' Horst Wessel Lied ' really lightens the mood whenever someone calls . If it were still Dr King , then I ' d be reminded to consider the plight of the civil rights movement every time Mom calls . Talk about a downer ! "
