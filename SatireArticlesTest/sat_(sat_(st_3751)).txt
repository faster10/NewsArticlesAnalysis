About twelve years ago I was working in Brooklyn , New York as a construction supervisor . Practically everyone on my site was an illegal immigrant , and none of us , including myself , made much money . But I ' ll tell you about one in particular Lorenzo Santiago Tzoc Vasquez , a man who became my best friend . Lorenzo came from a little village in Guatemala San Miguel . There were about a half dozen guys on my site from that same town . Lorenzo was about thirty years old and had a wife and two children back home . He was a Mayan Indian , a group despised in his home country by the Hispanics who controlled society this all goes back to the time of the Conquistadors . Anyway , Lorenzo , like everyone else on the site , first had to scrape together around 300 . 00 American dollars a huge amount of money in San Miguel . Then he took the next step , which was walking halfway up through Mexico , hundreds of miles . Then three days hidden in the back of a truck with twenty or thirty other illegals , sweating through Mexico ' s desert country , then walking all night to get across the US border in Texas . Finally , through the immigrant underground , Lorenzo made his way halfway across the US to end up in Brooklyn , New York .
