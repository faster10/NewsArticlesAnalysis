Spears reportedly has been adamant in her refusal to wear the black sequined burka insisted upon by bin Laden stating that , " it chafes " . After critics made light of her possible weight gain during her MTV performance last night , Spears is rumored to be reconsidering the burka . A deal has also reportedly been worked out in which Spears , who has had to face growing criticism over her parenting , will hand over childcare responsibilities of sons Sean Preston and Jayden James to a local Los Angeles madrasa .
