" This logjam is worse than ever , " said Denver passenger Lloyd Briscoe . " Seems like every agent here today is a trainee . Last time it was this bad was when the Broncos showed up for a flight . I thought they had their own private jet , but they went through screening just like any Tom , Dick and Harry . It took hours for the whole team to get checked out . Every last one of them set that alarm off . I missed my connecting flight but I got loads of autographs . "
