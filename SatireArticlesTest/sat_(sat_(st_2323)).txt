WASHINGTON , D . C . The scramble to replace outgoing Speaker of the House John Boehner ( R OH ) is in full swing , according to sources close to several Republican congresspeople . When Boehner suddenly announced his plans to retire from Congress this month during Pope Francis ' visit to the United States , it was presumed that Boehner ' s right hand and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( R CA ) would take the reins . Yet , after McCarthy made a serious error in judgment in commenting to Fox News Sean Hannity that the House Benghazi committee had benefited the GOP by hurting Hillary Clinton politically , McCarthy took his name out of consideration , and a full court press on Rep . Paul Ryan ( R WI ) began from all over the Republican Party .
