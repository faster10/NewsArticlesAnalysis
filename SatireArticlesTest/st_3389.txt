" Masterful ! " Said Jim Bixby of FOX News . " The president has really taken the fight to John Kerry in this campaign . He is stealing Kerry ' s best issues and it seems to be working . Our polls indicate that in states where The President rails against the administration he gains lots of support . Folks want to know that a guy like George W . Bush is a fighter for the people , and that is exactly what this new speech is doing . Masterful ! "
