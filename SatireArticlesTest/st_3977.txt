The second miracle is going to be rougher water on which to walk . On this one , I ' m stumped . Maybe you can help , because it ' s my hope that I ' ve convinced some of you that Paris is worthy to join the legion of the holy . Sure , she ' s not like Saint Francis . Of course , there is Tinkerbell . And she ' s not like Saint Lucia , whose eyes were gouged out as punishment for keeping her Christian virtue , though Paris is near sighted . But do you see anyone around up for this gig I mean the gig the way it used to be ? This is a Saint for the 21st Century . Even Barry Bonds had to use steroids to beat Hammerin ' Hank Aaron ' s homerun record . Can we really expect the saints of the new millennium to be like the saints of the old ?
