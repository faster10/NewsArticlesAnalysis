BALTIMORE , MD Nurse anesthetist Megan Poole , a veteran CRNA at Johns Hopkins University , set a new record on Tuesday morning by taking a break while already on a break from her case . The 46 year old had smoothly induced anesthesia on a 70 year old patient for placement of a prosthetic heart valve , when her colleague , Jim Wilson , arrived to give her a planned lunch break . After the standard brief signout procedure , Poole left the operating room and moved to the Anesthesia Lounge adjacent to the Hopkins ORs .
