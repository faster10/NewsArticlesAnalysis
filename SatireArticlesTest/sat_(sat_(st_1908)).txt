" Let ' s put it this way , " Gowdy later told reporters , " we don ' t have any evidence that Planned Parenthood broke any laws and they ' ve been cleared of wrongdoing in several investigations run by the states . We didn ' t have any evidence that Lois Lerner targeted only conservative groups in her scrutiny of Super PACs at the IRS . We never had any evidence that Hillary did anything bad on the night of the Benghazi attacks , and it ' s not like we had any evidence she had anything to do with Vince Foster ' s death . " Gowdy paused , " So how much evidence do you think I really need to in order to push the theory that Hillary somehow created the Holocaust before her own conception , really ? "
