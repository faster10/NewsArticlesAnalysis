The Wyoming Institute of Technology ( W . I . T . ) has concluded their findings based on a survey of over 20 , 000 police reports and interviews in areas throughout the nation . These include both reports that have led to convictions and those dismissed or withdrawn from court by the complainant or judge . Reports range from actual rape and sexual assault complaints to workplace harassment and various behaviors not advancing to the level of assault , but still supposedly not permitted in the new post revolution society that the 60 ' s has forged . Whistling , making lewd gestures and telling locker room style jokes make up a share of such reports identified and pursued with litigation in the range of this massively inclusive study . Some cases were settled out of court .
