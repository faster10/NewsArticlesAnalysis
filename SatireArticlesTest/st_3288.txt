" Imagine you ' re walking to the bus and it starts raining really hard , " LaPointe continued . " You ' re not wearing rubber boots , because it ' s hard to predict when it ' s going to rain , so your feet get soaked before you get on the bus , which is damp and crowded with damp people . It ' s dark outside and you ' re trying to put your umbrella away and get your change out for the bus , and the bus starts moving and you panic a bit because the floor is so slippery . By the time you sit down , you ' re sweating inside your coat and you feel bad . That ' s why I think the rain is yucky . " '
