A provider in the depressed stage will say things like " I ' m so sad I have to admit this person , why bother with anything ? or " I miss not admitting patients , why go on ? The admitting provider begins to acknowledge the certainty of an admission , but the idea of an admission seems pointless ( " Ugh , I guess I ' ll admit this neutropenic fever , whatever ) . It is common for a provider to become isolated and cry constantly , soothed only by a favorite blanket or warm milk .
