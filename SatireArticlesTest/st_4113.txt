As a political thesis , it is brilliant in it ' s clarity , monumental in it ' s obtuseness and precise in it ' s lack of specificity . It is also virtually unreadable . Still , there are some universal concerns that all nonmembers of the Movement seem to share . First and foremost among them seems to be , as we keep harping on ad nauseam , whether or not the Tea Party is actually a legitimate political Party or instead a Movement . The question seems to be at the very heart of the Movement , even the bowels ( making the TP a bowel movement ? ) . Even the document ' s title ( which is too much trouble to repeat here see paragraph one ) is perhaps the greatest tribute to the diverse nature of the Movement that ' s called the Tea Party .
