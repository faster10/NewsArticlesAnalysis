" I girded up my loins , and when that ball was snapped , I took the hand off and I hit the hole hard ! I ducked , weaved , dodged and jumped over players . At one point three defenders had me cornered with nowhere to go . To this day I can ' t explain it , but I was able to just jump about 22 feet in the air , do a somersault , land on my feet , and then take the ball all the way to the house for a touch down , actually a game winning touch down now that I think about it ! Yeah , it was a perfect undefeated season too ! It was really my greatest gridiron achievement ever . "
