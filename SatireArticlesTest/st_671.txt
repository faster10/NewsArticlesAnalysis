" And when the Lord ' s sheep Timothy returns unto him , the Lord will see him and welcome him , and notice that his 60 " plasma TV with HDMI inputs was totally sweet , " the priest intoned . " I spoke to many members of the family before coming up here today , and you all had some very cherished , lovely memories of Tim ' s things . Hold on to these memories and keep them dear to your heart , and hopefully , you will get the thing you ' re thinking of at the will reading after the ceremonies . "
