" There ' s too much snow to shovel , and these blow gangs , they know that , " said Lt . Richard Hengele of the Hamden , Conn . , police department . " People whose driveways are two feet under come up to them and they ' re like , Blow me ! Blow me ! Please please do me now . " ' So they blow your driveway , or your walk , and now you ' re in debt to them . They own you . "
