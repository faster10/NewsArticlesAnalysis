5 . Alternate energy sources ? wind , geothermal , hydrogen , fuel cells , solar power ? Nah ! The oily types pretend that they are ' researching ' these . Bull ! They are sinking money into the utterly ridiculous production of ethanol . The corn farmers love the idea . The entire country will have to be one large cornfield to supply the demand . Also , heat is required for the distillation of ethanol . Where does the heat come from ? fossil oil or gas ! 110 btu ' s of petroleum energy to make 105 btu ' s of ethanol energy . A huge , obscene scam .
