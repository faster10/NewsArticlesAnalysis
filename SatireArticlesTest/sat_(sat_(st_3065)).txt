As you know , my condition involves a faulty ignition switch that causes my engine to shut off occasionally . And with it the steering and airbags and brakes . I ' m not alone . I know of 2 . 6 million other GM vehicles that are also differently abled . Fortunately , it was diagnosed early , but my GM parents decided not to do anything about it . You have heard they were motivated by money , that they didn ' t think it was worth the cost to fix , but if you knew the real reason , you ' d be ashamed of the way you ' ve been treating me .
