Constantin told Gormerblog , Working in the ER is more pleasant and productive . The doctor asks how long the patient has had chest pain , and the patient says ' a while . ' Instead of a ten minute struggle to narrow that dumb answer down to seconds , minutes or hours , I just read the patient ' s mind and say , ' two days . ' " The psychic admits things can get tricky . A druggie came in once , high on five different party drugs . " I read his mind and got sick as a dog . They sent me home ! "
