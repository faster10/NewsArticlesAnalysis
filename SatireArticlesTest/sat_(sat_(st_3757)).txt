Immigration issue is a hot topic right now . Half the country hates immigrants . But tell me , if you had a country , what type of people would you want to come ? These men , who excepting Lorenzo , who at five foot ten inches was a giant among Mayans , were about five foot , three inches tall and maybe 145 pounds , but they would lug heavy materials all day long , never complaining . If they didn ' t have work because materials didn ' t show up on time , they ' d want to leave rather than get paid for sitting around doing nothing . Strong , simple but dedicated men , respectful , lonely , caring for each other because no one cared about them . I ' m honored to know them . Tell me you wouldn ' t want those guys to be legal Americans . If you don ' t , it ' s because you know , deep down inside , that they ' re better than you and you ' re afraid of them .
