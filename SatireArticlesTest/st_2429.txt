Worse still is that according to one of the show ' s associate producers , the network is planning to not pay the woman for the near deadly dare . " I spoke with one of our senior guys , and he says we aren ' t going to pay the victim the 500 , 000 she ' d earned up to that point , because she hadn ' t completed ' the dare . She ' s only getting the 250 , 000 . She had to you know finish him off ' for it to count , and she didn ' t have time to do that . I ' m leaving the show as a result . It ' s despicable . "
