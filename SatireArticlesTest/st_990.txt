The beauty of swiping a credit card is that it ' s not cash , so you can spend and not think twice about it . Why buy a bag of Cheetos at the hospital gift shop with cash when you can pay interest on it too ? Don ' t worry about paying off those credit card bills right away . It ' s not about being financially sound it ' s all about convenience . Did you know debt and interest builds character , just like burnout ? Like " no pain , no gain , " I truly believe " no debt , no wealth . "
