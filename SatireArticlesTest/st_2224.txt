The new regulations would put a cap on the total grams of sugars allowed in food and beverage products made in , or imported into , the United States . All consumable products , regardless of what type of product they are , will be limited to 5g of sugars per serving . Products that use a warning label , which the FDA is currently conceptually designing , will be allowed to go up to 15g of sugars per serving . All products with 10g of sugar or more will also need to sport a " candy " sticker on their outer packaging .
