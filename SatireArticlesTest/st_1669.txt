" Once they ' ve made up their mind , you ' re not going to convince them , " said industry expert Dorothy Miller . " They let this one run fourteen and a half seasons . They cancelled ' Miami ' after ten and ' New York ' after nine . With hardly any of the original cast even still on the show it seems market research reflected that the majority of viewers have moved on . Sure , like any show that has been around a few years , there is a vocal minority of fans that will speak up on social media , but I seriously doubt that will matter much to CBS ' s bottom line . "
