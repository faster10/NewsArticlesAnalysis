Although he was employed by the Department of Homeland Security , Mr Doyle represents a more personal side of the Administration ' s " No Child ' s Left Behind " initiative . Arrested by the FBI for having sexually explicit conversations with what he assumed was a 14 year old girl in Florida , but who in reality was an FBI agent , Mr Doyle apparently actually gave the agent posing as the girl his and his employers name and offered the number of his Homeland Security office and cell phones , sent a photograph of himself wearing his official TSA badge and offered to have Air Force One come to Florida to pick up the girl for a trip to visit his own personal " Washington Monument " . According to his lawyer , Mr Doyle is still trying to figure out how they caught him .
