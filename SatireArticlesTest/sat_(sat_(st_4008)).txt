Our government will be grid locked beyond belief . Taxes will be cut as our debt grows to unsustainable levels . Healthcare will be repealed . The power of states to make up any law that suits them , whether it ' s constitutional or not , will be strengthened . Rand Paul will try to pass a law allowing businesses to refuse service based on a persons color or religion or whatever criteria they chose . Hispanics and Muslims will be targeted and harassed and a few will probably be killed . Wall Street executives will find a new way to screw us . I suppose it ' s even possible war funding for Afghanistan will be cut , so they can say Obama lost a war .
