My next thought would ' ve been ( if the first one hadn ' t died of loneliness ) : since I believe the NSA is not mandated with investigating ' regular ' domestic civil or criminal cases , that any evidence gathered by them would be inadmissible , especially since in domestic trials a warrant is needed to gather evidence . The fact that ' In 2008 Telecoms were granted government immunity ' would seem to assume an illegal act was unwittingly committed by them , much in the way that if you helped a uniformed cop subdue someone and it turns out later the cop was just beating up his ex girlfriend ' s new lover , you thought that you were assisting the law , not breaking it and were innocent of assault .
