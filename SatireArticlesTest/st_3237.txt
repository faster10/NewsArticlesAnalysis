In Fresno , Cal . , Bristlewaite Construction president Richard Harper suggested the real problem lies with the Commerce Department ' s research , not the factory makers . Bristlewaite , which builds factories across central California , has never been polled by Commerce officials , he said . " We ' re one of the biggest factory builders in the West , so you ' d think we ' d be one of the companies they survey , " said Harper . " We got orders to build three factories in July . Three ! That ' s a 200 percent jump , not a decrease . "
