" There seems to be a retaliatory motivation behind Obama ' s slam against corporate America , " said former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin . The former GOP vice presidential nominee took to Facebook as Obama boarded Marine One en route to his 17 day Hawaiian vacation . " Well , " wrote Palin , " I guess we all should feel fortunate and honored that Obama bestowed a few few seconds out of his oh so busy day before hopping off to yet another island destination for an extended vacation of golf and partying with his buddies to throw us a bone . I guess Martha ' s Vineyard is too cold this time of year for his U . S . constitution . "
