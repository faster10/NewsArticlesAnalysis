" Oh sweet mercy , please don ' t make me work another shift with him , " said one of his ER physician partners . " Seriously , he doesn ' t even go into the rooms any more . We had a patient with fibromyalgia who was literally writhing in pain . He did nothing . I even showed him , in his own medical book out of his briefcase , how debilitating and painful the disease can be . I just went into the room and saw the patient after Dr Nim had dismissed without even going in the room . He needs to just retire or die . " We tried to speak with other co workers about his behavior , but others were not as positive .
