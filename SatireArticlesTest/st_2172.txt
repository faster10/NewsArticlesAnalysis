Asked about his mother ' s endorsement of Hillary Clinton , Reagan thought it showed how little America actually knew about the woman behind the Republican icon . " She wants people to know that the First Ladies are tight . They get together once a year to support each other . In fact , Hillary had no interest in running until both Laura and Barbara Bush cornered her at their get together in May 2013 and talked her into at least thinking about it ! So , in a sense , if Mrs Clinton does run and win , you can blame the Bush family . "
