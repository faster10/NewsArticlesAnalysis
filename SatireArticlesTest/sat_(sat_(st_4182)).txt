But we can ' t afford health insurance . We had it in 2003 for a year . Blue Cross charged us 3 , 750 . 00 apiece , or 7 , 500 . 00 . Our plan was to get insurance , then a complete physical . Then we complain about various illness we didn ' t have ( Gee Doc , my liver hurts " ) and have some extra tests done . If we found something was wrong we ' d keep the insurance . If not , we ' d drop it and wait another five years and do it again .
