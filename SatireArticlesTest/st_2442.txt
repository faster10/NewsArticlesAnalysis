" Reparations Bistro " opened it ' s doors in September of 2011 in the gentrified North Portland district as a way of paying the people of color back , as well as any other downtrodden minorities and casualties of white greed . " We proudly invite old residents of this neighborhood back to dine here , free of charge " , Derringer added . He has even expanded the menu and added a " soul food " section to cater to ethnic groups who may not enjoy the rest of the pricey fare available at his swanky bistro . Things like southern fried chicken , ribs , fried catfish , chitterlings and grits . " Don ' t forget the bottomless grape Kool Aid ! " Derringer enthusiastically exclaims .
