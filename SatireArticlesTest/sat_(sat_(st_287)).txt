" I used to listen to Mozart to calm myself down and meditate , but it just wasn ' t working , so I figured that maybe a better stereo would help make the experience more satisfying , " Westfin recalled . " So ever since I installed the Paradigm Performance Series stereo system , the only CD I could find that would truly push the limits of my system was the recording of the Koto Drummers I picked up from Starbucks , and that ' s all that I ' ve been listening to lately . Truly amazing . "
