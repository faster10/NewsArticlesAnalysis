Dr Chip Hackman received an unpleasant surprise during one of his emergency consultations for appendicitis . The OR nurse reports that while Hackman was discussing the particulars of surgery with the patient , the patient commented , " Thank God I ' ll be asleep for this ! " to which Dr Hackman replied , " You ' re welcome . " Both the patient and the nurse present began laughing and it took several minutes of intense questioning for Hackman to realize that the patient had been referring to some other God , who wasn ' t even a surgeon .
