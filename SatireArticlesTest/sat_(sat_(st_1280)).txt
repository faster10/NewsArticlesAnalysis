You never really " clear " a patient when doing a preoperative evaluation for noncardiac surgery . The goal is to make an objective assessment of risk and make recommendations to best optimize a patient before surgery . It ' s up to the surgeon to use that information to properly inform the patient about risks , benefits , and alternatives . Many hospitalists want to defer to cardiology , but it ' s best to keep it simple . If surgery is emergent , that trumps all . If there are active cardiac issues , fix those first . If there are no cardiac issues and the surgery is low risk , then proceed to surgery . The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is a very useful tool if you need to quote risk as percentages .
