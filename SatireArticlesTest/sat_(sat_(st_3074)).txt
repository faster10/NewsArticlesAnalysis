Oh my God , I found Arab Spring just so mischievous , even , dare I say it , naughty ? ! Everyone I went , people sported that dangerous , Come and get me ' look . Threatening . Very Malcolm X in the City . " ' For Arab Summer , I sense more muted , repressive tones . More a throwback , 1950s feel . Think Abdul Nasser patriotic , but at the same time despotic . I ' m thinking the uniform look will be back . Khakis and camouflage . Everywhere . Day and night . The catchphrase will be Repress for Success . " '
