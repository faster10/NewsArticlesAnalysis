ED physician Jennifer Hillgis is very happy with the new rules saying , " America has the highest opioid use in the whole world , it ' s time to just accept it and move on . Plus these drug seekers don ' t take up any of my beds anymore . They come in , get their drugs , and go home . No more spitting at my staff or cussing me out because I ' m denying them medication by looking out for their safety . " Dr Hillgis was surprised that some patient ' s allergies have literally disappeared overnight . " If we are out of Dilaudid then many people are ' willing to try something else , ' even if they have a documented allergy for it ! "
