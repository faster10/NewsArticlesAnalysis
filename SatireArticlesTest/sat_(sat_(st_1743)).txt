" Maybe Putin will be president , I ' ll be Vice President , and we ' ll move legislative functions to Moscow , " Trump said , " and maybe we ' ll just let Russia handle it all . I ' m not sure . What I do know is that no matter what we ' ll start paying taxes to Russia . Whether we get representation for that taxation would be up to the arbitrators , and don ' t worry , I ' d hire attorneys from Matzoh Town , so you know we ' d be getting the best negotiators possible .
