ANN ARBOR , MI For several days medical intern Brent Hammock appeared very confused . He had lucid moments now and again , but he was usually in a daze . He was disoriented , agitated , and combative . He was clueless . More often than not , he responded only in one to three word answers , if he chose to answer questions at all . Family members were concerned that he was different . So were his colleagues . Nurses questioned his judgement and finally brought it up with Hammock ' s team : he was altered and becoming a danger to himself and others . For that reason , Donna Rice of Psychiatry was consulted .
