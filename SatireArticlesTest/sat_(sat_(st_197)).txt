" I rapidly noticed that something was seriously wrong , but it was already too late , " Mr zt rk told reporters . " I ' ve had some whale getting caught in the nets before , but this had nothing to do with it . It literally made our ship rotate and it began pulling us . It was extremely scary ! Most of the men panicked and jumped overboard , so it was impossible to release the nets in time to save the ship . After about two minutes , I realized that there was nothing that I could do and I jumped in the water , only moments before the ship capsized . "
