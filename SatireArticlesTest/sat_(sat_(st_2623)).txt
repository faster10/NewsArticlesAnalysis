Despite the cold welcome , Malouf says he is not bitter toward America , its citizens , or even Governor Haslam . " I get it , we all get it , " Malouf said , " religious extremism is religious extremism no matter what . The sad part is really that the Christians here are playing right into ISIS ' plans by doing this . They want us to feel cold and shut out . They want to foment an us versus them mentality between the West and the Islamic community of the world . So hopefully one day Americans re embrace the melting pot idea and my family and I can live in peace and pursue the American dream for ourselves . "
