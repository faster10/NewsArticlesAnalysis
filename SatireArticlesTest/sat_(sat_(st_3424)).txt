Bush stated that America was at a crossroads of hard choices , and that unless other funding appeared , the rebuilding strategy in Iraq was over , and that simple prayer would have to suffice from this point onward . Bush further signaled that he had not totally given up the possibility of rebuilding in Iraq and that the administration would be launching a " Pledge for Victory " campaign to the American public which would coincide with National Public Radio spring funding drives across the nation . " Americans will simply have to make a choice between supporting their troops and the country of Iraq versus a liberal defeatist propaganda outlet . " he stated .
