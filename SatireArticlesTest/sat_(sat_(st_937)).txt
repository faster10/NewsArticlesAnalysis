" Just these past few days alone , he has misplaced his stethoscope , mistaken insulin for aspirin , gone into an airborne isolation room without a mask , ordered a stat social work consult for placement , and fallen asleep during a spinal tap he was performing . Did I mention he once ordered serial chloride levels ? Chloride levels . I ' m glad Rice was called . It was time . "
