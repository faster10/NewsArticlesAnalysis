Native Americans aren ' t holding a gun to our heads and forcing us to buy their gas and cigarettes or gamble in their casinos if they did we ' d no doubt start shooting them again . And while I ' m doing my best to quit smoking , until I do I ' m going to search out the cheapest prices I can find for cigarettes , like I try to find the cheapest prices for everything else I buy . I pay income tax , property tax and sales taxes on 99 . 5 of everything I buy to the state of New York they can get along without my cigarette tax . Or , if they really want honest competition , they can lower it . That would show those Indians .
