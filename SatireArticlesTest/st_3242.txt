This is a new approach for me , as I ' ve said . Normally I ' m what you ' d call a " stage setter . " I like to set the scene , shape the context around which my media are experienced . But this time I ' m going commando . Frankly , I don ' t know how you ' ll react . Surprise ? Shock ? Joy ? Likely all of these and more . We will know for sure once you ' ve seen the shot , a vacation selfie taken outside a rustic but delicious seaside shrimp shack .
