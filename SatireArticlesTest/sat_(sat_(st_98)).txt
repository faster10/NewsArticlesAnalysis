According to the Quran , Muhammad sought to marry the young woman after dreaming of her multiple times . " You were shown to me twice ( in my dream ) before I married you . I saw an angel carrying you in a silken piece of cloth , and I said to him , ' Uncover ( her ) , ' and behold , it was you . I said ( to myself ) , ' If this is from Allah , then it must happen , " reads the Quran .
