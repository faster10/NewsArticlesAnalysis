" Another stop on the Obama Apology Tour , " said former Alaska Governor and FOX News political commentator Sarah Palin . " Apparently , even while on vacation Obama just can ' t stop saying ' I ' m sorry . ' You ' d think he ' d give himself a vacation from all that apologizing while on vacation , but I guess they do things differently when they go far away from the U . S . where golf is his main priority instead of respecting a brave military couple ' s fighting for our great nation ' s freedoms while trying to find a little bit of happiness and create a lifetime of memories .
