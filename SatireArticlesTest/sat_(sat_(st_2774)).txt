Many voters are outraged by the technical issue . " It ' s expletive ridiculous . Totally expletive ridiculous , " says George Riley , 48 , of Richmond , Virginia . " I voted Republican straight down the board . I ' m an American , not a Russian . I don ' t vote for communists . But this machine here , it switched every single one of my expletive votes . All of them . It ' s like I didn ' t even have to show up today . Why did I even leave the house ? I could be watching TV , and instead I ' m sitting here watching that expletive Obama steal my expletive votes . What the expletive country is this , anyway ? "
