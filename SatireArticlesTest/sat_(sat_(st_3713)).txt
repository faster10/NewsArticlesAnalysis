Lorenzo Vasquez , Mr Camping ' s illegal Mexican gardener ( for as Mr Camping has many times said , " The meek shall inherit the Earth , and you can ' t get any meeker than a guy who gets 5 . 50 an hour to edge your sidewalk ) was quoted as saying , " Mira , at first I was a leetle afraid that Senor Camping would have another stroke when he woke up and saw us all gone , but Madre Dios , how upset can you be about a guy who pays you 5 . 50 an hour ? "
