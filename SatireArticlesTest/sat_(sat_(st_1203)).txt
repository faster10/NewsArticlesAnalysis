Richard Dorowitz , lead counsel for the NRMP , issued the following statement : " Medical school admission is a highly competitive process , and ultimate selection of the student body at each of the nation ' s LCME accredited medical schools is predicated on a variety of factors , specialty balance chief among them . Obviously it makes no sense to carefully allot positions to future family practitioners , OB GYNs , and " baby doctors for rural Africa " only to have students change their minds and wreck the balance down the line .
