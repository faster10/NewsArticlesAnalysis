" I ' ve been trying to get our polling station closed , but they ' re not letting us , " says Martha Logan , a local election official in Murfreesboro , Tennessee . " I ' ve been on the phone all day with the State ' s election commission , trying to tell them what ' s going on , and meanwhile I ' ve got angry voters in my other ear , but they just keep telling me that there isn ' t anything we can do but keep letting people vote . I don ' t know what to tell these poor people , and I don ' t even know if this ' ll get fixed , either . "
