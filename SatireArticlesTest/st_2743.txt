" This terror attack was awful . Very , very awful . None of those people deserved to die the way they died . It ' s disgusting , " Trump told the station ' s anchors . " You know , I ' m going to get in a lot of trouble for saying this , a lot of trouble , but I said this was going to happen . I predicted this . I ' m like , ' why does no one ever listen to me when I ' m always right ? ' But Obama , he ' ll never listen . Hillary doesn ' t listen . They aren ' t great thinkers like I am . They aren ' t great listeners . "
