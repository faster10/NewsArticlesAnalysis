Carol F . , Virginia : " I know it ' s wrong to think about my best friend ' s husband , but he ' s , wow . He ' s got the whole package : iPhone , MacBook Air , iPod Classic , AppleTV , plus a massive , 12 core Mac Pro with Xeon Westmere processors and two terabytes of memory . My husband , by comparison , has an iPod nano . Which is why I keep an external hard drive in my bedside drawer . "
