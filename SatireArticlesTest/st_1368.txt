When asked what the ramifications of deleting all the third year clerkships might be regarding the training of these young physicians , a dean from one of the participating schools had this to say : " Medicine has simply changed . Doctors no longer need to talk to patients or examine them . Doctors can simply cut and paste from other physicians ' electronic notes and scan patients from head to toe . Why should we train them in these anachronistic skills when what they really need to know is how to code ? We need to train doctors for the job they will be doing , not the job their grandfathers did . And the reality is that ICD and E M coding are so complex that today ' s physicians simply don ' t understand it . We can no longer justify sending young doctors out into the world without this vital skill . "
