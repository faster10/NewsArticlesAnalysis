" There ' s nothing entirely remarkable about Binkies immediate appeal " , said noted clown expert and curator of Americas largest clown museum Mitch Headly . " in one instance you have a simple minded audience who loves exaggerated movements , old overdone tricks and have trouble realizing that it ' s all a show . Then , of course , you have actual children who clowns usually perform for . It ' s very understandable that a group of people conditioned to political pantomime have trouble distinguishing between the empty words of people like Marco Rubio and the empty fire buckets of a professional clown .
