" I stopped by this little Asian market to pick up a 6 pack of my favorite pale ale and that ' s when I noticed the bath salts . I figured , what the heck I thought they were a little pricey for such a miniscule amount , but you know these little corner markets jack up the price of everything . I thought the guy kind of looked at me funny when I requested to purchase them . I wish I would have known then what I do now . "
