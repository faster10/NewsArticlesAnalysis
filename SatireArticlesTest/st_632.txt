Said resident Tim Robinson of the performance : " We have people come over here and sing all the time , but nothing like Remi . You can tell by the way he got into the part of the song that goes ' No woman , no cry , ' that he ' s got more soul in his fingernail than any of us have anywhere . It was the kind of thing that only an African American can do , and I don ' t think I can ever listen to a Bob Marley song again that isn ' t sung by someone from Africa . I mean , you can ' t fake soul . "
