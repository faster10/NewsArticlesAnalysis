Here ' s some statistics : out of the 34 counties in New York , only 8 have a majority Democrat voter registration in short , New York state has over a quarter million more registered Republicans than Democrats . Until Spitzer came in last year we had a Republican governor for the last twelve years and our state senate is GOP controlled . Yet by her second election Hillary pulled a fair amount of those Republicans into the fold . Sure , a lot of them could have been Independents , Working Families or even the one registered Rent Is Too High party voter ( now , there ' s someone I gotta meet ) , but a case can be made that almost a half million of them at least were from the GOP . In short , Hillary Clinton has been a damn fine Senator and even the Republicans here know it .
