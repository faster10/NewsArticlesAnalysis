McElroy also took umbrage at the noise level during her stay . " There was all kinds of noise out in the hall outside my room , all night long I could hear other guests ' yelling and screaming at all night long . Some of them sounded like they were delirious or in severe pain . They must have been throwing some sort of drug fueled , BDSM party down the hall , but meanwhile , I ' m trying to get some shuteye ! But even if they had been quiet , I still had some box mounted on a pole next to my bed that kept beeping . ALL . NIGHT . LONG . But the worst was the helicopter that always seemed to be nearly landing on the roof . You ' d think the FAA would be more careful with their flight paths . "
