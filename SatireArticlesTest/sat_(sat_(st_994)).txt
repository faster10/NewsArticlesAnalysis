As for the menu ? Chef Lacroix ' s summer tasting menu features eight dishes that exemplify hospital cuisine at its finest . The dishes progress in consistency and complexity . The first dish , entitled NPO , is a fantastically simple dish that is best described as a plate full of nothing , which celebrates a patient ' s fast and inability to eat before a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure . Clear Liquids is a refreshing chilled dish featuring creme fraiche and chives in a Gatorade consomme that dazzles . Renal Diet is a dish of fantastic irony using kidney beans in a lemonade broth . All of the dishes , including palate cleansers , reflect on the history and culture of hospital dining with a sense of humor .
