" The music business is tough , but sometimes you get lucky and catch a break , which is what ' s happened here , " said Drexel . " We ' ve already been in touch with local bands ' Conflagration ' and ' Your Mom ' . This town sucks and nobody has any gigs yet , but as soon as one of us does , then all three will have a chance to rock out and show our stuff to all kinds of people who wouldn ' t have seen us otherwise .
