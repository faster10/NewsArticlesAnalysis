Another parent , who asked not to be identified , says he ' s filing a lawsuit . " This is America . In this country , we speak American . We pray to our American God , Jesus Christ . And I never read nothing in the Bible demanding I dress a certain way . If you ask me , these kids were heroes . Maybe it ' ll teach these people that this is America . They don ' t need to believe in that stuff no more . They don ' t need to wake up every morning and say Allah aardvark ' or whatever it they say . I ' m suing the school district . I don ' t want my kid to become a Muslim . I don ' t want them to become bad people . "
