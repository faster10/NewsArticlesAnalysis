" I was working a shift once when this horrible case of abdominal pain came through , " she explains . " It was a 17 year old girl who told triage she had 10 10 pain all over her belly and that she hadn ' t been able to eat all day . I ran over to her room only to find her chatting on her cell phone with a friend about a boy in her class that she liked . No moaning or groaning . She looked truly comfortable . "
