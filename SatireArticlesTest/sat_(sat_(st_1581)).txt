Carson also said since one of the alleged attackers is still at large , people should not open their doors to strangers , and should exercise extra caution when accepting mail deliveries . " If you aren ' t expecting a package for example , and one just shows up , I would contact the authorities . There was a box sitting on my front stoop the other day that I refused to bring inside until the bomb squad arrived . Luckily it turned out to be from Fruit Of The Month Club . Bartlett pears . Delicious , but they could just as easily have been deadly hand grenades . "
