5 ) All these so called " social " programs Medicaid , Medicare , even Social Security and now Obama care are actually government run Socialist programs designed to let the government control your own medical needs and decisions . Shouldn ' t we " opt out " of them not cash our Social Security checks , refuse to enroll in Medicare when we turn sixty five , not apply for food stamps or mortgage restructuring should it become available through job loss , our reaching retirement age , etc . ? The Tea Party is first and foremost a moral Movement , even more than a political one . The majority of us believe that abortion is a sin and we respect the sanctity of all life . Shouldn ' t we refuse to participate in whatever cures are derived from stem cell research , volunteer to adopt the children of unmarried pregnant women who are considering abortion and not participate in any so called Social ( ist ) program that already exists ? It is , after all , our moral duty to stay true to tenants ' of the Movement .
