But the GOP ( Greedy Old People ) weren ' t beaten yet . Within weeks , Rush Limbaugh was blaming everything the GOP did under Bush on the new president and openly advocating against the leader of our country , asking , " What ' s wrong with wanting the President to fail ? " , perhaps forgetting that if the President failed then the country would stay in deep shit . Americans were appalled when they realized that ' Affordable Healthcare " meant you still actually had to pay something for it . Catholic bishops complained about birth control , rightly pointing out that since their priests only diddled little boys who couldn ' t even get pregnant , they shouldn ' t have to be forced to pay for contraception . It just wasn ' t fair .
