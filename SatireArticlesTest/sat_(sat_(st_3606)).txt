Mr Wellstone died 11 days before the election . If he had died 10 days before , the Democratic Party could have left his name on the ballot . He would be a shoe in as a sympathy vote , then the Democrats could have found someone later to take his seat . Knowing this , Wellstone made sure he took his wife with him so she would not substitute for him on the ballot as did Jean Carnahan for her husband Mel , running against John Ashcroft in Missouri in 2000 , Webb speculates .
