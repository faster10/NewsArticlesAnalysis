Originally from Detroit , Michigan , Nugent initially found fame as lead guitarist for The Amboy Dukes before embarking on a solo career . Highlights from Nugent ' s life include a 1977 interview appearing in High Times magazine , in which he famously told a reporter how he avoided the Viet Nam War draft : he did not bathe , brush his teeth , or shave for 30 days leading up to his pre induction physical . To sweeten the pot , he also defecated in his pants . " I was so proud , " Nugent recalled . In later years he denied those accounts , saying he made up the story to trick the gullible reporter . That same year , Nugent ' s song Cat Scratch Fever dominated the rock and roll charts .
