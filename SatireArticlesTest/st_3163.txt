Author ' s Plea : Every day , millions of cicadas are cruelly , savagely , needlessly eaten . Any why ? Because they ' re delicious . But it doesn ' t have to be this way . You can make a difference . Take the time , right now , to call or write the birds . Tell them to stop eating cicadas . Do it for Treetop and Grass , for Ptera and Cyllata . But most of all , do it because it will really confuse the birds , who don ' t know how to read .
