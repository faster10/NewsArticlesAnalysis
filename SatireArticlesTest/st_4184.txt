I don ' t want free healthcare , mind you , and I don ' t even really want extensive healthcare . I ' d love one complete physical with perhaps two fifteen minute checkup visits and maybe a blood test a flu shot a year for my wife and myself maybe two grand worth of stuff . That would be about 1 of my income and I ' d pay for it in premiums . Then I ' d pay another 1 as ' insurance ' , whether I ' m sick or not . For any other doctor visits I ' d be happy to do a co pay right now , a self pay visit costs me about 70 . 00 I ' d be happy to pay for half .
