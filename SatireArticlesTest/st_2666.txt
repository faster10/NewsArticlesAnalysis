Proponents of LGBT History Month say it ' s the logical next step in honoring all Americans for their contributions to society , regardless of their sexual preference or gender identity . Jack Tiede , former history professor and choral director at McMurry University in Abilene , believes teaching children LGBT history may even help some kids struggling with their own sexuality or gender identity . " I really don ' t see what all the fuss is about , " said Mr Tiede , " what ' s wrong with teaching our kids that people from all walks of life have contributed to this great nation ? " Jack says parents have a simple choice to make , raise their kids to be tolerant and well educated , or keep them sheltered and uninformed . " I don ' t know what they ' re so afraid of , " continued Tiede , " intolerance is something taught in the home , and unlike being gay , lesbian , or bisexual , nobody is born a bigot . "
