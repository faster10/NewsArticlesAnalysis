" I recently had a patient come in with pain , " explained EM physician Ted Stelling , as he clicks " unable to obtain history on his electronic medical record ' s admission document . " What kind of pain ? Beats me . He didn ' t know when it started or how long it ' s been going on . When I asked where his pain was , he sweepingly gestured with his arms from head to toe . Gee , great , thanks . " He amended his note in an all too familiar way : " Patient is a poor historian . "
