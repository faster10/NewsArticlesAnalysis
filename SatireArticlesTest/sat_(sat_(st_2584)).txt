" We ' re fighting for something bigger here , " Thompaulsen said , " an overpopulated , under educated , simple minded populace that truly believes their government is best run by people who will take their money and give them nothing in return just because they ' re asking for less money than in other states . We don ' t live in America anymore if we can force rape victims to have their rapists ' babies , nor if we don ' t have the freedom to climb inside every coochie in our state if we have to , to ensure the dignity of life is preserved . Not the dignity of the women , because that ' s not as important as the dignity of that tiny , unformed , sort of gelatinous life form that ' s kinda like a parasite if you think about it . "
