One of Chicago ' s most infamous crowd unrest events occurred in 1979 , after a local radio station advertised a " Disco Demolition Night " at Comiskey Park , to boost ticket sales for a White Sox double header . Reduced admission prices caused the anticipated crowd of 20 , 000 to grow to more than twice that number . Over 50 , 000 Chicagoland fans showed up , crashing the event after it was sold out . The crowd rushed the field and began rioting , causing the Chicago PD to intervene , resulting in multiple arrests and the cancellation of the second game of the double header .
