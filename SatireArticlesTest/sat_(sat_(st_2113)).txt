After one bite of my bland taco , I assessed a need for spice . A bottle of vinegar based hot sauce sat next to the dented napkin dispenser at our table . I removed the wooden ball shaped cap to discover it completely clogged with a red clump of dried sauce . I shook the bottle but to no avail as nothing came out . I wound up having to smack the bottom of the bottle with the same force I would a scratch awl to make a rivet mark on a piece of sheet metal . The clog dislodged and a huge squirt of hot sauce spewed forth soaking my taco and the nearby rice . The look of exasperation on my face caused my wife to touch my hand in a signal to calm down .
