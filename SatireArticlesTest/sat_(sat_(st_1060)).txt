What ' s that ? The patient ' s chief complaint is of a kind treated almost exclusively by my variety of doctor ? Don ' t worry . My team will guide your team ' s management of the problem by distantly following the patient as consultants . You will know we are true to our word when you see our hastily scribbled one line notes in the patient ' s medical record . And , rest assured , we will make sure the patient receives a visit in our clinic , should it become evident that we must continue to manage the problem after your team has written and signed his discharge summary .
