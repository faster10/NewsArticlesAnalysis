I feel very strongly about the genital herpes crisis occurring throughout our great country right now . Something needs to be done , and it needs to be done NOW . There are millions of young men , women , and a surprising number of women in their 60s who suffer from this lifelong affliction . NO LONGER do they need to suffer in silence . I encourage everybody out there with recurrent perineal sores to stand up and shout , ' I ' M WITH HERPES ! ( Cheers and applause . )
