For a moment I wondered if that could ever be true . Am I really to blame for the all things that I do ? I thought about calling to Karl for help , then I shook my head no , and I laughed at myself . You see , I can ' t be blamed for the things that I ' ve done since you can never have Peace without bombers and guns . So I called to my guards , " Send them into the night ! Merry Christmas to all , now get out of my sight . "
