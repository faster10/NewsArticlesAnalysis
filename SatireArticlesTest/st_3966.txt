The cops come to my house yesterday . They were responding to a neighbor ' s complaint about my RV . By the way , there ' s nothing more enjoyable than having the police show up at your door because someone called them on you , listen to your story , then leave after apologizing for bothering you . Well , actually it wasn ' t the ' police ' , but the security guards here in this gated community where we ' ve been renting a house . The reason for the complaint ? I had a 35 Winnebago motor home parked outside my house . Now , anybody who ' s read my stuff should realize that out of all the things I ' ve done in my life that could ' ve required police intervention , parking an RV outside falls way down on the list .
