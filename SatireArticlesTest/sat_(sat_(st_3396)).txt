The Pentagon referred to one prisoner whose condition was probably aggravated by being left in intense isolation by doctors trying to avoid the malpractice liability incurred in treating him . " The patient ' s regular interrogator was unavailable , so a guard asked the psychiatrist who usually worked with him to turn out the lights in the cell . He said , ' Are you out of your mind ? ' Cpl . Latos recalled . ' I have never seen this patient before , I could get creamed . ' " As a result , the patient ' s cell was flooded with light 24 hours a day for three months , and he ended up talking to nonexistent people , hearing voices , and crouching in a corner of the cell covered with a sheet . The " creaming " the psychiatrist feared , according to the Pentagon was a malpractice suit .
