If I was to give the photo a title it would be " Serendipity , " since everything came together perfectly as I was taking it , as you ' re soon to discover . But I decided not to give it a title to avoid influencing your interpretation the meaning you assign to it . I guess technically , then , the title is " Untitled . " But I will go with " Serendipity if anyone out there wants to use the image in a photography textbook or awards show .
