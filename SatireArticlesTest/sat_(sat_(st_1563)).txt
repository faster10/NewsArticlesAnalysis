It ' s a common superstition that it is bad luck if anyone or anything crosses the path in front of the dugout during a game . Cubs fans will be quick to inform doubters that Santos immediately struck out on three pitches from Mets Pitcher Dwight Strawberry which started a turn of events that led to the Cubs giving up a 6 0 lead and falling in extra innings to the Mets , 8 6 . Cub pitcher Ray Burris , who had sailed along until the incident , lost all command of the strike zone and the Metropolitans batted around twice in the next inning to tie the score . The Cubs then proceeded to drop the next two games and suffer an inglorious three game sweep to the Mets .
