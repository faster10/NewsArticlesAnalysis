Copenhagen Construction workers working on the renovation of the basement of an old warehouse in the Danish capital , have discovered many boxes of documents dating from 1917 and 1918 , that allegedly confirm that Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov , better known as Lenin , would have been for many years an active agent of the German Secret Service . The files are linked to the Handels og Eksport Kompagniet , an import export company that was used as a front organization by the Bolsheviks before and during the revolution , and which presumably served to enable the transfer of German funds , weapons and supplies to the Bolsheviks .
