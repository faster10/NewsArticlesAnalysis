We smoke , but are trying to quit . But statistically smokers are good for the system . Forty or so years of paying thousands of dollars in extra tobacco fees , then at around sixty five or so we get lung cancer and die quickly . We don ' t linger and burden the system like say , a diabetic would . We just kick off and all the FICA and Social Security money we paid for forty five years just ends up in the system . We ' re a pretty good deal , even if we do smell like an ashtray .
