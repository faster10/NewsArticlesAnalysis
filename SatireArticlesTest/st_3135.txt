Named for the rough weather " sou ' wester " hats popularized by the Gorton ' s fisherman and Van Gogh , the Sou ' wester Alliance is comprised of five distinct , yet closely knit , ethnic tribes the Mary Celestes , the Gloria Anns , the Andrea Jeans , the Dorothy Alexanders , and the Stella Maries . Although to a person they lack light hair , Nordic builds , and ruddy complexions , they claim their ancestors came from Nova Scotia and were shipwrecked in Zaranj after getting lost during a storm off the Grand Banks .
