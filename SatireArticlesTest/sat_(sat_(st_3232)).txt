Right now looking at my schedule , and I really can ' t see anything before June , and then we ' ve got two weeks scheduled at Cape Cod with the kids . And I cannot change that . The wife would kill me . And those places book up in advance , too . At least the ones near the water . We ' re not ON the water because my wife booked the place and it was called Ocean View ' something and I ' ve been to the Cape enough to know that ' s probably not anywhere near the ocean . It might not even be on the Cape . Seriously , when I do show up , those places are the first to go .
