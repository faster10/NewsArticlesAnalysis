If a certain site like , say , the Temple Mount in Jerusalem , is claimed by more than one religion as a holy place , then it becomes not just say , a synagogue , but a multi denominational place of worship a church , a mosque and a synagogue . Muslims pray there on Friday , Jews on Saturday and Christians on Sunday . The rest of the week fat tourists in checkered shorts , sandals and gym socks take pictures . All symbols , the crosses the crescents and stars , stay in place side by side , symbols of peace and understanding . And also in the interest of peace , no restaurant would sell pork chops or cheeseburgers .
