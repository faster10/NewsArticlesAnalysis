Reportedly , Hewlett Packard ex CEO Carly Fiorina was livid about the line of questions she and the other candidates got . " Have they not been paying any attention to the last seven years , " Fiorina demanded back in her hotel room according to staffers , " we have been acting like petulant children for a long time . We ignore real world problems like income and wealth inequality , gun violence , and climate change . That should tell everyone right then and there that we are in no way interested in tough questions . That ' s why we bang the culture war drum so loudly it ' s far easier to look good to conservatives by bashing immigrants and women who practice their own sexual autonomy than it is to have a real discussion about how to actually lift people out of poverty .
