It ' s something they do well , this flip flop thing . It ' s an Administration that prides itself on never changing it ' s mind , never adapting to the ebb and flow of either politics or war . They ' ve taken a serious character flaw and somehow turned it into an asset in the minds of half the nation . It allows them sit back , nod sagely and say , " Good . Everything ' s falling apart on schedule . " just as if they planned it that way . For my part , I love to see people change their minds , acknowledge their mistakes , then try to do better .
