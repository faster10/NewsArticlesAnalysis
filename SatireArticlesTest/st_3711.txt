The close friends and followers of Harold Camping the spiritual leader and long time host of the Family Radio Network that has broadcast his call in shows for decades have shown that although Mr Camping ' s first assertion that the Apocalypse would occur on May 21 , 2011 failed to be accurate , rather than being disillusioned or angry , they are indeed , as the Bible urges us , forgiving and filled with love . Of course , in their case , the ' love ' part seems to have been the love of good old fashioned practical joke to be played on Mr Camping , who had revised his " End Time " date from last May till October 21 , 2011 .
