Cruz finished his question and answer session with reporters and told them that he would " make a decision sometime in the next few months as to whether to focus more hate on refugees or immigrants , " but that ultimately he doesn ' t think voters will punish him too harshly for whichever decision he makes . " As long as I cast aspersions on some group that our voters dislike gays , uppity minorities , refugees , immigrants , or liberals they ' ll support me , " Cruz said , " I know that . They know that . So why hide it anymore ? Cruz out ! "
