No one can do what Waters has done today . Now laws are in place to protect the general public and the innocent impressionable eyes of America ' s pure and virtuous teens from the purity of Waters ' trash . John Waters will be remembered as the world ' s greatest cult filmmaker and he will forever hold a place in my heart . The world has lost a great man who put his garbage on film for all to see , and Satan has gained an esteemed colleague . Rest in peace John .
