Last year , administrators from Westchester Medical Center observed how pet therapy with dogs at nearby Blythedale Children ' s Hospital was helping children cope with their illness , bring some joy into their hospital stay , which led to more pleasant experiences and even quicker recovery times . It didn ' t take long for them to champion and implement a parallel program to help with hospitalized adults . Though Westchester Medical Center is only a few months into the project , hospital administrators are very optimistic about its potential .
