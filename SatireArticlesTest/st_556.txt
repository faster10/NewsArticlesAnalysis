" The State of California is considering mandatory counseling for couples about to get married or considering having babies , in which they would each watch two hours of the Aleman family ' s home videos of their trip to Disneyland , " said Clara Thompson of the Children and Family Services Division of northern California .

In fact , it made me infertile on the spot . "
