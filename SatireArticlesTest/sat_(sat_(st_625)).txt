" Thank God no one was killed , " said Hillary Guffman of Human Rights Watch at the UN headquarters in New York . " It would have been so easy for security officials to murder one of the suspected perpetrators at any point in this bust , which in of itself is a gross violation of the rights of these individuals as civil dissidents whose only connection to mass murder is based on circumstantial evidence . The loss of a single human life without due procedure is a crime against all humanity , and we might not be so lucky the next time government spooks pull a stunt like this . "
