Walk around campus with a big bag of mini eggs . Look friendly . Offer them to people you know , people who you were in Vanier with back in first year , people who dropped out of your MATH 152 class back in the day . Offer mini eggs to total strangers . Be nice ! Tell them you ' re running for a position , but don ' t be a dick about it . Answer any questions they have honestly . Maybe tell a joke . Then leave them alone .
