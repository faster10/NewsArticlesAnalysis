Look Kim uh , Jong er , Il I wanna get serious here for a minute . First , I commend you for shutting down all those nuke plants , but I think you missed the point a bit when you shut down your program , you weren ' t supposed to send all the stuff to Syria and Iran . Maybe we shoulda been more clear on that , but that ' s Condi ' s fault , I admit it . Still , it shows your commitment to peace , and I ' ve always said you should be committed . Get it ? Committed . That one kills me too . Of course , it might not be as funny in North Korean .
