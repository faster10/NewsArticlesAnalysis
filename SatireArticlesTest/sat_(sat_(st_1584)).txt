LEE , SOUTH CAROLINA 2016 Republican Presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina has been rising in the polls since her performance in the second televised GOP primary debate . In that debate , Fiorina attacked Planned Parenthood based on sting videos put out by a right wing , anti abortion group . The veracity of the sting videos has been largely dismissed , but that didn ' t stop House Republicans from holding a congressional oversight hearing over defunding the low income health service provider , and though none of what she said she saw on the videos in question can be found , and certainly not in the context she provided , Ms . Fiorina has won an award from The League of Anti Female Women , a conservative think tank focused on " returning control of our uteruses to those who know how best to utilize them men , " according to its charter .
