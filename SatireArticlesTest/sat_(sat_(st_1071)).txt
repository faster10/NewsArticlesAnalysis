I ' ve been wheezing a little bit more over the past few days and I ' m worried that my asthma is starting to act up . I use my Advair regularly , but I ' ve been needing my rescue inhaler a little bit more . I don ' t smoke . My nephew has been sick with a cold I think that ' s what did it . Do you think it ' s safe for me to tough it out at home or should I come to the emergency room and get evaluated ?
