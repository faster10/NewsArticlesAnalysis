For Japan in the 1930 ' s leading up to WWII , their reason for attacking China and Southeast Asia had more to do with economics than anything else . Sure , ideologically they believed they were superior to Chinese and Koreans , but what they needed were resources . They had no oil , no iron ore , none of the things a country needs to expand peacefully through trade , so they decided to just go take it from everyone else . They attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor to forestall reprisal for those actions . Of course , Roosevelt ' s embargoes of scrap steel and such in reaction to Japan ' s invasions actually made Japan ' s problems more acute , a self perpetrating cycle . So for Japan , the war in the Pacific was primarily an economic one , for the US and it ' s Allies , it was a defensive one . Ironically , the Allies were fighting to keep the possessions they had taken by force a century or more earlier for economic purposes themselves . What a world .
