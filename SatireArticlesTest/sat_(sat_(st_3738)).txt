Sure , I was as angry and saddened as every other sane thinking person in the civilized world as I sat , first watching the aftermath of the deadly explosion of the Deepwater Horizon , then the devastation caused by the subsequent oil spill . I was horrified when Sarah Palin tried to blame environmentalists for the disaster . And I was , at least initially , enraged at Texas Representative Joe Barton ' s apology to BP ' s Tony Hayward and his description of the 20 billion dollar fund the Obama Administration forced BP to set up as a " Chicago style shakedown . " But then I got to thinking about it all maybe Barton wasn ' t so far off the mark .
