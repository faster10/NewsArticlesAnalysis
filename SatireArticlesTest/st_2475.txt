" All my brother did was commit a wire fraud , " explained Jane . " He ' s not some thug on the street . He ' s paying his debt to society and he ' s remorseful . It ' s not fair ! If he were an animal or a minority , PETA would be all over this case , or Al Sharpton and the new Attorney General , Loretta Lynn . But since my brother ' s a normal , average , conservative American , nobody cares ! This administration doesn ' t give a damn about regular American citizens ! "
