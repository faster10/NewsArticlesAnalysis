Audience members reported hearing about a dozen shots , aimed directly at the former vice presidential nominee during the opening moments of her speech . " They were apparently waiting for her , " said Clive Hersholt , seated in the fifth row of the auditorium just feet away from one of the two arrested men . " There was one speaker before her who made opening remarks , and then Gov . Palin got up to speak . " Roughly 3 minutes into her prepared remarks , two men at opposite ends of the auditorium stood up and started to heckle the former governor , shouting Grifter ! Opportunist ! and Money grubber ! " This one guy kept firing these cheap shots at her , one right after another , calling her a quitter and a " half termer " before the security guys jumped on him and dragged him out . He probably fired off a good dozen shots or so rapid fire before it was all over . "
