Don ' t get me wrong there are Hispanic gangs and there are a lot of Hispanic illegal immigrants and some of them take advantage of the various social service systems . There are also a lot of White Supremacist and Black gangs and a lot of poor ( and rich ) White and Black Americans who game the system too , not to mention Chinese , Vietnamese and Cambodians , Native Americans and radical Christians . Pick a race , creed or color and you ' ll get bad people . You ' ll also get a whole lot of good ones too .
