It ' s amazing really , but I posted my first Cindy Sheehan story on August 7th , just ten days ago . When I Googled the News link to Ms . Sheehan ' s name at that time to get some background , I think there were maybe a couple of dozen pieces about her her web search had more , but the news link was pretty sparse . After posting my first piece a few of my ultra Liberal and well informed friends had no idea who I was talking about . Today , there are nearly two million news pieces posted about this woman and I think you ' d have to go deep into the Brazilian rainforest to find someone who hasn ' t heard of her , although I ' m pretty sure I even saw a posting about her on The Yanomamo Tribe Blog .
