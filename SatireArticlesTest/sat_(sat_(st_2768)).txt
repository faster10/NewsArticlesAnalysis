An acting colleague of Vin Diesel that asked to remain anonymous believes that Diesel is being wrongly targeted . " I ' ve played with him ( Vin Diesel ) several times in the past few months and he is a charismatic and level headed player . " explains the anonymous source . " I think these people complaining about him are just terrible at the game and are jealous of Vin ' s skills . You don ' t put decades into playing these games , like he has , and not become one of the premier players out there . I ' m sure him being well known just compounds this problem because the media will pick up on something as ridiculous as this and run with it and these kids know that . "
