When my computer committed some sort of technocide last December , I found myself with extra time to kill in my day where I used to be online , like twelve or thirteen hours . Since I couldn ' t write about politics and my wife refused to listen to me rant for more than a minute at a clip ( to be quite honest , I agree entirely I can be pretty boring ) , I decided that the best thing to do was pretend politics and the attempted Evangelical rape of my civil rights just didn ' t exist . No George Bush , no Iraq , no warrant less wiretaps or Creationism taught as science , no NPR , no CNN , no foreign policy debacles or indictments of our nations leaders in short , it was like I was living in Alabama , except for the no Creationist thing of course .
