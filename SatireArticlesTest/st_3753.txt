Lorenzo was also saving up each week for something special he was going to buy an old box truck , load it with construction materials and tools and when he was ready to go home , which on average for these men was after three years , he ' d drive it all back to Guatemala , build a house with the materials , then use the truck to start a delivery business . Remember , this was a guy , who spoke not one word of English when I met him other than hello , and barely spoke Spanish as the Mayan dialect K ' iche ' was his native tongue , could hardly read or write Spanish , let alone English , having maybe a third or fourth grade education . To me , that ' s the American spirit in a nutshell .
