You can protest a ticket , but once a car is towed , you must pay the money for your car before you can protest the parking ticket . When you finally get the chance to protest the ticket , an image of your car is all they need . The photo does not need to show a Loading Zone if your car is in a loading zone it does not need to show Street Cleaning times if your car is parked during that time . With your license plate in the photo is all the need .
