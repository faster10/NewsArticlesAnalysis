BTW the ties I ' m referring to are Oprah ' s boyfriend Stedman Graham and his partner , Armstrong Williams . You remember Armstrong Williams he ' s the fellow who took a quarter mil from the Bush Administration to tout their No Child Left Behind program by pretending to just be a disinterested observer . It was just one more thing that the Bush Administration did that was against the law , but this time it happened to be with Stedman ' s business partner . And Oprah has always been friendly with Laura just watch her old shows .
