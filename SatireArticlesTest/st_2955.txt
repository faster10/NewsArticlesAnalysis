Maybe that sounded awkward . I can ' t tell about things like that . So let me explain it another way . When I look out at your young , smiling faces , I see a thousand beacons of hope for our future . I see a thousand torchbearers for the world of tomorrow . But mostly I see a thousand potential competitors who , if they get in my way , I swear to God I will screw so bad that when I ' m done with them they will be looking up at Friendster .
