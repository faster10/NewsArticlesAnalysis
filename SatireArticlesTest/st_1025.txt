" That kid was real goofy , memorable for damn sure , " replied Peterson when asked about Eric Johnson . " He wrote his name across his mask before scrubbing into every case , which was just real weird . Then he would sing to every damn song on the radio right up in my ear ! I wanted to scoop out my eardrums with the scalpel . He ' d be basically leaning on me and singing in this high pitched voice . He knew every word to every damned song on the radio but couldn ' t answer a damned thing about anatomy . And to top it , the son a bitch wore that stethoscope around his neck all the time , called it his ' ears . ' He ' d usually use those damned ears to tell me about bowel sounds or some other nonsense . "
