Mr Fitzgerald immediately turned over the find to the National Zoo staff . " I was just walking along and I happened to see the little guy out of the corner of my eye as he was trying to dart for cover into the mud , " said Mr Fitzgerald . " The little thing is kind of pathetic because it tries to pull its heads in its shell when it gets frightened , but they block each other from getting into safety . On the other hand , it really has an overdeveloped ability to urinate copiously to drive predators away almost like it ' s constantly leaking . "
