Unnamed White House Source Wegman ( Pudgy ) Waterhouse , speaking on the condition of anonymity said , " Before you get all hot and bothered , just think about it . First , ever since the war began Democrats have been falling all over themselves trying to convince everyone that they support the troops . Second , they keep critising George Bush over the way he ' s been handling the war . Third , everybody keeps calling formore troops . Well , this is a perfect way to get all those extra boots on the ground that everybody keeps calling for . We can drop a quarter million more bodies in Baghdad in no time flat . Put up or shut up , that ' s my attitude , dude . "
