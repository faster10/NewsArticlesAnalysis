On a personal note , I had just completed civic duty , my days spent as a juror where a 17 year old piece of garbage tried to weasel out of an armed robbery conviction . Thankfully , I was made " foreman " and I saw to it that the punk was sent up to the federal lockup where he belongs despite his threats against me and a well publicized attempted assault during deliberations . It ' s a good thing for him the police made me leave my side arm in the car or they would have been burying a bullet ridden lump of smoldering Swiss cheese , not sending it to prison .
