" If the lady had not refused to come out peacefully of the washroom and explain calmly that she was in fact in her rights to be there , there would not have been an escalation of violence . The woman threatened police officers and that is what made things difficult for her and the agents that intervened " said Charlotte Mecklenburg Police Department spokesman , Allan Jones , in a press conference . " She was hysterical and represented a possible threat to our officers who followed all proper procedures in this case , " he adds .
