Anyway , now everyone is starting to question whether or not having women serving the Church in amore uh , I mean in a more substantial capacity may lower the incidences of child sexual abuse among male Priests . To them I reiterate the Catholic Church and it ' s centuries long practice of both Priestly Celibacy and these recent allegations of abuse prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Church is not really a ' chick oriented ' organization , so just forget it . It ain ' t gonna happen on my watch .
