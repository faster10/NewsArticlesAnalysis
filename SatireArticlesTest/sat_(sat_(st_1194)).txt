Surgery is the lovable rogue , the one out for personal gain like Han Solo but likable since he ' s honestly trying not to kill anyone . There ' s a heart buried somewhere under that scruffy exterior and belt full of lasers , bovies , and power tools . Han Solo freezes upon exposure to carbonite or ECGs . Han Solo is always trying to get into the pants of Princess Leia . His " bucket of bolts Millennium Falcon is the Da Vinci Robot circa 2000 . Yeehaw !
