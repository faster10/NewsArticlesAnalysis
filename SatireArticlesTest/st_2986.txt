Polar bears are so cute . Look at them dancing and playing and watching TV and drinking Coca Cola . We really do love them . In fact , hmmm , aren ' t they in some kind of trouble ? Why yes , yes they are ! Global warming ! Oh my God , save the polar bears ! Save the ice caps ! Reduce carbon emissions ! Over regulate industry ! Raise taxes ! Veto drilling rights for oil and gas reserves right here at home in ( North ) America ! Think of the polar bears ! blech . This spot is worse than The Day After Tomorrow . But I think David Axelrod , or whoever wrote this , miscalculated . The protagonist is fat and white . It ' s like giving Newt free face time .
