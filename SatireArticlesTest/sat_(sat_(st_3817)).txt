I had been there about an hour when this was actually April 5th news didn ' t travel instantly back then and Nuns as a habit get it ? A habit ? listen to much radio or TV one of them came running outside , completely distraught and with tears running down her face , almost screaming that Reverend King had been murdered . I ' d never seen a Nun display any other emotion than frustrated anger at their pupils in school before and the sight of her fear and obvious agony startled me to point where her expression is still imprinted in my memory to this day . It was clear in that look that somehow the world had just changed . And it was a bad change .
