" I am realizing too late that all of my jokes were about Mrs Boston , " Peterman said . " My insistence on mocking her personally has been my downfall . If I had instead focused on her policies and the system that she was a part of , one that emphasizes lack of independent thought , conformity , rote memorization , obedience to some nebulous authority and God figure with the concomitant and arbitrary persecution of anyone who does not follow the rules , then I would have legs to stand on . But instead , now I sincerely miss Mrs Boston . "
