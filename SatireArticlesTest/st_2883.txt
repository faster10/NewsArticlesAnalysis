Strike out on your own to pick through the original James Fort and see not just things left over by settlers , but leftovers of the settlers themselves ! Or join a small , inside and up close tour of the 1609 storehouse led by master chef Gilles Grimande , Director of the Jamestown Anthropogastronomic Society . The tour then moves on to an exclusive , behind the scenes visit of the archaeological vault for a rare look at the 1609 1610 menu collection , most of which will never go on public display because they ' re all so insanely repulsive ! And that ' s before you realize what the menus were written on !
