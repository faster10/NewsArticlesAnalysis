Sole survivor of a crew of seven Chinese fishermen who ' s ship capsized during a violent storm , Mr W ng showed some incredible perseverance and resourcefulness to survive in this harsh environment , making the best use of every possible resource available . He first gathered thousands of plastic bottles that he put together by using some torn fishing net , creating a raft of acceptable floatability . He then arranged a few large plastic tarps that he found to cover the maximum possible surface area in an attempt to collect some drops of rain or condensation , gathering with difficulty the minimal quantity of water he needed to survive . He also achieved to gather some fish and even catch some sea birds by using some other pieces of fishing nets and his ragtag fishing rod .
