Speaker Ryan ' s critics came to the fore when he made his list of demands for accepting the Speakership . Ryan insisted to his Republican cohorts that should he run and win the election to replace former Congressman John Boehner ( R OH ) as the second in line to the presidency behind Vice President Biden that they fall in line behind him . But what set off his opponents is when he made his " family time " a strict condition of his speakership . Ryan said that he didn ' t want to spend as much time fundraising as Boehner had because his family time was so important to him .
