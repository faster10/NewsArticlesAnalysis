Once there , all the San Miguelian ' s shared the same ratty apartment perhaps twelve or thirteen guys total sleeping mattresses spread all over the apartment , all eating from a huge pot of black beans and rice as a normal daily meal . I had managed , through all sorts of lying and padding my labor bills to add one or two phantom Juans or Pedros to the workers lists in order to make sure that if one real guy got sick or hurt I could still give him a days pay . They each made about three hundred fifty dollars for a fifty hour week , better than most sites . Three hundred of that usually got sent back to their families , ten or so got thrown into the communal pot for food and rent , the rest was theirs for Salvation Army clothes or whatever .
