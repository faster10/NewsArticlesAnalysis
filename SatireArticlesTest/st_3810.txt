My parents were kids during the Roaring Twenties and then lived as teenagers through the Great Depression . Their parents came to the US from Europe just before WWI . They were the poor immigrants of the early Twentieth Century and although they had a decade or so to get started on their new lives in America , they also hadn ' t really acquired much wealth to lose by 1929 . My grandfather had small farm , which my Uncle ' s John , Al and to a lesser extent my Dad were able to keep paying the mortgage on .
