In closing , I hope I have inspired you to follow your dreams today . Although apparently I haven ' t inspired all of you . I ' ve just been passed a note saying , " Please stop talking . My friend Terry is suicidal now . " That is nice of you , warning us of your friend ' s potential suicide . But did you know I already do that with Facebook ' s suicide alert system ? It ' s true . And if you try to help , I ' ll think you ' re competing with me . And I won ' t trigger the alert system . And your friend Terry will die .
