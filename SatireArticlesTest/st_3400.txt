Bush called the Guantanamo malpractice suit " a perfect example of the out of control litigiousness of our society . " He recalled that John Kerry once blamed him for failing to head off a flu vaccine shortage he knew was coming . Bush said the Guantanamo suit illustrates the " broken medical malpractice liability system that Democrats falsely claim to want to fix , while voting ten times against reforming " that is the real reason so few companies make flu vaccines , and not the incapacity of profit driven corporations for developing money losing treatments even in the interest of national health .
