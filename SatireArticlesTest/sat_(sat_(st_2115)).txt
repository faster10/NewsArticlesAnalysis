I was in fear of rising from the table to make my way to the restroom , afraid of accidentally blocking one of the wild kids as they ran through the restaurant aisles . What would happen if one clunked my knee or thigh and pummeled to the floor in a bawling fit ? I was more than 20 to 1 outnumbered and my concealed Ruger six shot wheel gun only had 2 rounds in it , hardly the firepower I would need to escape the place should a race confrontation ensue . My wife in her zeal to eat dinner out had left her pistol at home .
