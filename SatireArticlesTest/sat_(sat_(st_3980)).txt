After watching this trend with dismay from the late Forties through early Sixties I had finally found some hope in the Hippie Generation . For awhile it seemed that people would finally begin to change their ways and adhere to principles I stand for , but alas , the Hippies ( who you can call your grandparents ) morphed into greedy and self absorbed adults and have now passed down their expectations of entitlement without effort to first their children , and now you , their grandkids . My continuing to reward such avarice only makes me an enabler . It must stop now . I ' ve come to realize that the last children who actually deserved anything for Christmas grew up during the Great Depression .
