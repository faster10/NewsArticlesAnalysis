Seriously , I don ' t know why you ' re even making a big deal out of this . Unless I caught you at a bad time . Did I catch you at a bad time ? You were busy killing innocent civilians or something , right ? Isn ' t that always the way ? I mean , you ' re just getting in the shower or sitting down to dinner or killing innocent civilians and suddenly the doorbell rings , except in this case it ' s not a doorbell it ' s a bomb . Semantics .
