Having morphed from a groove based band having new wave stylings into a synthesized pop elevation jamband , The Flaming Lips present a danger to youth with their confetti strewn visual carnivals and large handed excess . Young girls ( and boys with feminine qualities ) are drawn to the Flaming Lips jamband . Their stage show , having many of the same traits as Justin Beeber or any tiger beat Pop Sensation , is the next step up from childhood allures spawned by Saturday morning cartoons , barbie dolls , and watching construction machines . When psychedelic drugs are introduced , that same effeminate child , having grown to reject Jesus and authority , will gravitate to this dangerous band .
