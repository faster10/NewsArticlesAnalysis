One of the quickest ways to get the lifestyle you want is to have someone else get it for you . But it ' s not all that easy to convince someone to just cut check after check to you . If you get creative though , you can find ways to entice them to hand you money that you can use to pay for stuff , as long as that stuff can in any way be remotely defined as serving some purpose other than purely personal gain . Like say , if you promise to help that billionaire get something out of his government he normally wouldn ' t be able to get because he didn ' t have personal , direct access to someone with enormous power and influence , that ' s a great way to get money from super rich people .
