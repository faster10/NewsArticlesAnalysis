" The truth is that Congressman Ryan , like most people with two brain cells to rub together , knows that no matter who takes the job they ' ll be maligned by the base , and hamstrung from compromising and therefore governing . It ' s a fool ' s errand , " one source close to Ryan said , " and so if for some reason Rep . Chaffetz can out bench Congress ' most ripped rep , then he ' ll take the job , otherwise , he ' ll just keep his head down and keep writing punishments that are short on working math , but long on demagoguing the poor .
