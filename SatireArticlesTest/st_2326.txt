" It ' s very important to Congressman Ryan that everyone understands how ripped he is , " one staffer told the press , " and being very pro Second Amendment , he ' s always offering people two tickets to a gun show . " The same staffer said that should Ryan accept the nomination and win the House election , he will install several free weight stations throughout the rotunda , and will put a set of free weights and barbells on the Speaker ' s dais itself so that he can " always be sculpting his finely chiseled body .
