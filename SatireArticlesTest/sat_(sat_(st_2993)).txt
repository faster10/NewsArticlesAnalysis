Elton John is the king . He doesn ' t want to share his Pepsi . His subjects try to entertain him to get some . Acrobats , dancers , jesters . When they fail , he pushes a lever . They fall into the dungeon . Then Melanie Amaro comes in , sings " Respect , wins the crowd over , and drops Elton through the hole to the dungeon , where he meets Flava Flav . Honestly , who wrote that ? Nancy Pelosi ? I ' m not gonna waste my breath explaining it .
