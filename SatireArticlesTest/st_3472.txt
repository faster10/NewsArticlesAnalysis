It ' s not just me either . I believe everyone ' s biased against me as well . I feel like every pretty woman who looks at me thinks I ' m an ugly , disgusting letch ( which may not be a bias but a sad recognition of an indisputable truth ) , every conservative I talk to thinks I ' m too radical while every radical thinks I ' m too conservative ( actually , they ' re both right I like to think of myself as a liberal , tree hugging gun lover ) .
