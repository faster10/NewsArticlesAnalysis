" After all , what is ' deviant , ' what is ' morbid ? ' " Roberts asked . " Is it deviant ' that in Jurisprudence II ' s Roe v . Wade ultralevel , the players have to fight innocent zombie virgins and gun toting fetuses ? Is it morbid ' that MegaChief Justice , the Chambers of Death protagonist , must dismember the spectators in the gallery by the end of oral arguments , which he does by switching his nanorobes to invisibility mode and wielding his six bladed sword of justice ? But beware the evil Primogeniture , his bloodthirsty henchwoman Casus Belli , and their pet Boa Constrictionist . "
