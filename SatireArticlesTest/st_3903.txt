2008 After eight years of borrowing money from China to fund a couple of wars and refusing to raise the money to repay the loans , capitalist America under Dubya found itself in the odd and rather ironic position of being deeply in debt to a communist country . Then one morning all the bankers woke up and realized , " Shit ! We ' re broke too ! " and promptly went to their Uncle Sam to get ' bailed out ' . To help things along , the stock market went into panic mode and crashed as well . Uncle George , uh , Sam , signed TARP into law , then let the bankers keep taking huge bonuses while they foreclosed on Americans homes . It was a happy time ( if you were a banker ) , but regular Americans were troubled something to do with losing their homes , life savings and all that crap they ' d bought from China ( You just can ' t help some people , I swear ) .
