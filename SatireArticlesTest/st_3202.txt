Now , to be honest , I don ' t remember saying that , per se . Maybe I was too sick . In those final days , the medication they give you tends to cloud your memory , which is particularly difficult when you don ' t have a memory . Or maybe I don ' t remember because the pain was too intense because I couldn ' t take the medications because the nurses couldn ' t hook up the IV because they couldn ' t find a vein because I didn ' t have , for instance , arms .
