The revelation of what has become known as the " Downing Street Memo " and which may come to be referred to as the Real Downer Memo by White House insiders has begun to reverberate throughout the halls of Congress and the Senate , prompting Democrats and even some Republicans to call for a formal investigation into when exactly President Bush decided to bomb the crap out Baghdad . Bits and pieces of evidence suggest that it was as early as November of 2001 , or a full fifteen months before the invasion began , something that the Bush Administration has long denied . Those same bits and pieces also seem to suggest that George Bush and his staff were not just committed to war , they were also willing to manufacture the pretext to support it .
