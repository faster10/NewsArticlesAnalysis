" I had my heart set on a new " Surfmate " fishing rig for my truck , " said Beaufort Hunsacker , 45 , of Virginia Beach , Virginia . " Bass Pro Shops Outdoor World had it for 50 off , so I made the trip all the way from Virginia Beach this morning . I got to the store early this morning and almost had one in my hands , and all of a sudden I got tackled from behind , and this Secret Service guy is telling me to relax and stop struggling after the pepper spray I couldn ' t really see anything else that happened . The " Surfmate " was gone after they let me go . "
