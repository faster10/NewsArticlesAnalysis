Since war is good for the economy , but houses are bad for the economy , then why don ' t we start a war against homes , Mr President ? This would be a fantastic idea that only a liberal nut could disagree with . I say we start demolishing homes of those whiny liberals who will only end up going through a foreclosure anyways . Not only would this create jobs for people destroying the homes and get rid of these houses that liberals don ' t deserve , but it would reduce the foreclosure rate by getting rid of the houses before they are foreclosed upon . Just think of what a merciful act that would be on your part , since you would be sparing liberals from having to go through foreclosures .
