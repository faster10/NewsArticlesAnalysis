I did find out that he calls himself a " board certified " ophthalmologist . Actually , he ' s certified by the National Board of Ophthalmology founded by Paul himself , he ' s it ' s president and his wife the vice president . It ' s address is a UPS store and lacks even a website . God only knows why , but its not recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties , the group that actually does that sort of thing . A spokesperson for the ABMS stated bluntly : " He is not board certified . "
