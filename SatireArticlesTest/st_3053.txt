Aside from the card games , gamblers at " The Sigh " can try their skills at charades , musical chairs , acrostics , or wander into the Scissors Paper Rock Room , which allows bets of up to 20 on a best of seven series . If they want to experience just a little of the Vegas flash , they can wager on local youth league basketball games , or play Spin the Bottle with what Sighing Pines pit boss Larry Storch termed " high class Minnesota prostitutes .
