WEST LAKE , IOWA Just days after making national headlines in the second televised Republican debate of the 2016 presidential election season , Carly Fiorina is back on the campaign trail and grasping at even bigger headlines . During last week ' s debate , Fiorina made a splash by not only confronting Donald Trump for his comments about her looks , but also by daring Hillary Clinton and other Democrats to watch the " sting " videos released by a right wing , anti abortion group against Planned Parenthood while citing a scene that many in the media have said simply does not exist in any of the tapes released . While many of Fiorina ' s detractors have said her statements about the sting videos show a pattern of deceit and exaggeration such as her touting of her record as CEO of Hewlett Packard which is flawed at best the candidate herself seems to have shrugged off any criticism of her alleged fibbing and is now telling a story on the campaign trail that paints her in an even more extraordinary light .
