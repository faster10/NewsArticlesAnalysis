" Here ' s what I will say about gun violence in America , " God said as he was ending the press conference , " it ' s not something that can be fixed in one , two , or maybe even three generations . " However , God said , " That doesn ' t mean you all shouldn ' t try to do everything you can in your time . Yon ' t rid your body of cancer by ignoring it . You don ' t clean up after a flood with more water . You try to do the best you can to fix what you think you can and you keep doing it . Maybe the number of people dying in mass murders is a relatively , statistically small amount of people , but frankly I ' m offended that anyone would use that as an excuse to not do anything about them .
