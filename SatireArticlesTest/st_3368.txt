" The Fed is committed to ensuring that inefficiency clears the market . Until inefficiency clears the market , we will print as much money as necessary , creating more inefficiency to be bought and sold , since inefficiency likes company , " said Chairman Ben Bernanke . " We ' re not quite certain what the exact market clearing price of inefficiency is , but according to our econometric models , we know with certainty that it isn ' t lower , and it must continually rise in perpetuity .
