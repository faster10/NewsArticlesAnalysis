And by the way , the sidewalks are for what their name implies walking . You ' re young and strong ( or fat and lazy only you know the answer to that ) , but what makes you more important than women with baby carriages and old people with canes that allows you to park blocking the sidewalks with your cars ? If you ' re young and strong you can park down the street and walk . If you ' re fat and lazy , you should park down the street and walk it ' ll do you good . And remember , the police will ticket you ( mostly because I call them and ask them to I actually add up the number of potential tickets and point out that if they hit a certain street , they ' ll pay a cop ' s salary for that shift . Works like a charm . )
