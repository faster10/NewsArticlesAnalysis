God said " it ' s not rocket science how laws are supposed to work . " He said that " when he gave Moses the Ten Commandments he never expected that all murder , adultery , lying and being shitty to your neighbor would stop magically . " God said he put rules against those types of behavior in place " to protect as many people as possible " once he " saw the need to instruct humans how to be less shitty to each other . " He said he couldn ' t understand why " everyone all of a sudden thinks if a law doesn ' t completely stop something from happening that it ' s a bad law . "
