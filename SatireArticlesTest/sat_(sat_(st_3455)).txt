Also , deep down inside , I think most of the people who initially supported the war are now embarrassed by it . They ' re embarrassed because they allowed George W . Bush to play to their fears , to lie to them , to use them and now they don ' t want to think about it . It ' s become that thing you saw on TV that you absolutely had to have but didn ' t need , that you paid too much for and it doesn ' t work well or fit right so you stick it in the closet and pretend it doesn ' t exist .
