" We never cheated on each other before this . Our marriage was sound , " Palmer continued . " We raised three beautiful children , we went to Church services every Sunday , we made sweet heterosexual love two , sometimes even three times a month , or more if we had a birthday or it was Valentine ' s Day or Labor Day . It ' s obvious that gay marriage did all of this . Gay marriage ruined the sanctity of our traditional , heterosexual marriage . And we won ' t rest until it ' s banned again in Indiana . "
