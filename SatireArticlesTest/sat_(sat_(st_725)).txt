" It is always hard when moving to a new place and struggling to be accepted , especially when simple things like daily prayer are looked upon with great suspicion and scorn , " said Abdul Mutalib . " But it did not take people of Browning long to stop eying my family like we were plotting to take over city hall and replace the village charter with Sharia . We know now that this is the place where we will raise our children as good citizens , with strict instructions not to travel to Pakistan to train with al Qaeda . Thanks , Browning . "
