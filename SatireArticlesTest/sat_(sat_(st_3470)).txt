Anyway , let ' s get back to the real reason I ' m writing this , which is how I perceive young Asian men . I can ' t look at a twenty something Asian male without thinking that if he wants to he can kill me in a second with some esoteric karate aikido martial arts thing that obviously all young Asian males know how to do , even if they were born in Cincinnati and are Art history majors in school . ( You know , it must be great . all ' s you ' ve got to do is stand there with a slight scowl on your face , looking all inscrutable and people automatically assume you ' re a stone killer . Plus that straight hair thing is too cool . ) You can even be a ninety pound weakling and it doesn ' t matter , cause everybody knows that size means nothing when you ' re a black belt heart pulling karate dude .
