We all do it , it ' s the ultimate failsafe . Palliative Care makes it all better . You may try to dance around the consult and win them over with key phrases like " code status and " goals of care , " but they ' ll figure it out , based on the patient hollering belligerently in the background of your phone call . But that ' s what ' s amazing about Palliative Care . They ' re fazed by nothing , and when all ' s said and done one of two things will happen : ( 1 ) the patient will be cooperative or ( 2 ) the patient will be DNR . I ' m not sure how they make this magic happen , but I swear they do it every time .
