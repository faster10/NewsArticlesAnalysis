I was starting to have reservations about dining at this particular establishment when our food arrived . Two large platters were placed in front of me and my wife . On half of my plate , three soft shelled tacos were hidden beneath a bed of shredded lettuce that was stuffed into the doubled corn tortillas along with the meat , onions , Mexican cheese , and tomato bits . A flat scoop of brown refried beans with melted shreds of the same cheese overlapped a similar scoop of orange Mexican rice with green onion and pepper specks , both items of which occupied the other half of the plate . My wife had a similar rice beans ' side dish on her plate . Her burrito was thick and covered with a brown sauce , Mexican cheese , and clumps of shredded lettuce . For some reason , even more fried tortilla chips were piled on top of the mess .
