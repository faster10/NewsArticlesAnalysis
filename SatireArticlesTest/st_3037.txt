According to sources , the 87 new members were given a long list of challenges late Tuesday , with the goal of collecting points for each task achieved ( see list below ) . The points varied depending on the difficulty of the task . Taking down the President ' s pants , for example , was worth 100 points , while treeing an atheist or a Prius owner ( literally chasing them up a tree ) was worth five . Getting a 5 , 000 donation from an oil company ( 1 point ) , and turning in potential illegal aliens ( 3 5 points each ) , were deemed to be the easiest tasks , while the most difficult missions were photographing Barney Frank and Rachel Maddow kissing ( 200 points ) , actually reading a Sarah Palin book ( 500 points ) , and finding Barack Obama ' s Kenyan birth certificate ( 5 , 000 points ) . The winner , not known at press time , will become president of the freshman class .
