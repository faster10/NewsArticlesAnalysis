" These two incredible women showed me that it ' s not about how people define you . It ' s how you define yourself , " Bieber explained in his personal email message . " Rachel Dolezal proved to the world that your outward appearance isn ' t what matters . It ' s how you feel on the inside that ' s what you need to put out there for the world . And Caitlyn Jenner showed us that America is a place where anything is possible . Where modern technological advances in medicine can let you become whoever it is you know you are on the inside . You just need to belieb ' in yourself , and anything is possible . "
