BP itself is a noble and caring entity whose angst over the spill is palpable . After all , who wouldn ' t be affected to the point of tears watching 2 . 5 million gallons of profit a day leaking out into the water ? That ' s a terrible tragedy , certainly on par with the losses being sustained by fishermen and tourist communities along the coast . At 3 . 00 a gallon , BP is losing nearly 7 . 5 million dollars a day ! Are any shrimper ' s losing that much ? I don ' t think so . So it ' s actually worse for BP than it is for the people of the Gulf Coast , but all ' s they can think about is their selves . It ' s sad .
