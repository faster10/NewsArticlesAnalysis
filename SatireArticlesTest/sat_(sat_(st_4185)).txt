But if I got hurt or really sick , I ' d need help . Ten years ago I had a 3 hour surgery with an overnight hospital stay . I was out before breakfast . I had two fifteen minute return checkups as well total cost 20 , 000 . 00 . At the time I was pulling down 30K a year , but I also couldn ' t work for nearly nine months because of it . Luckily , I made it clear before I went in that there was no way in hell I could ever pay for it , so since I was dying and all the hospital did me as a " Clinic Patient " , a degrading category that means you don ' t get breakfast and when you go in for a follow up you wait with the homeless and junkies for as many hours as they want for your turn . Believe me , I was grateful for it .
