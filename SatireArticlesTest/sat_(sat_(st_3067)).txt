I shouldn ' t be surprised . Humans have a long and sordid history of prejudice . For example , do you know what an " absence seizure is ? It ' s a type of seizure where your body briefly just switches off . One second you ' re up and running , the next you ' re not . These seizures are associated with epilepsy , and in ye olde barbaric days , epileptics were considered abnormal . They were persecuted , ridiculed , cast out . And all because they shut down occasionally . Just like me .
