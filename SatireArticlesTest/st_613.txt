" This isn ' t the first time this has happened , " said Paul Shriver , who has been friends with Davis since childhood . " A couple of weeks ago , I was telling Brian about the time I got stoned off my ass and took my Mom ' s SUV off roading . It was a funny story , but the whole time I was telling it , Brian was all straight faced and shit . Then , he gave me this speech about how things like that are so much more dangerous when drugs are involved . I mean , I could almost see Sheila pulling the puppet strings above his head . "
