The Reality : Gov . Romney has in fact been very consistent about what he would do , it ' s just that no one believes it . His strategy : On day one , as promised , President Romney would declare China a currency manipulator . To keep China from retaliating with trade tariffs , Romney would then agree to outsource U . S . currency manipulation currently handled by the Treasury Department to China , which can manipulate currency more cheaply . Utilizing his experience running the Salt Lake City Olympics , Romney will also make China pay a sponsorship fee to become the " Official Currency Manipulator of the U . S . Treasury , " which China can use in advertisements and on athletic wear . President Romney would then use the sponsorship fees , as well as the savings and tax deductions for outsourcing , to enact a leveraged buyout of Syria , which , in its distressed state , he would declare bankrupt , lay off its citizens , sell off its assets , and clear an estimated 480 million ( after taxes and depreciation ) , which would be used to pay for a war against Iran , unless Iran backs down , in which case he will just buy a really nice horse for his wife .
