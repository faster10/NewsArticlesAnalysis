Zimmerman is heard yelling something again , and finally the teens stop . One of the teens rather articulately asks Zimmerman to leave him , his friend , and his town , alone . " Sir , sir , we don ' t we don ' t have an issue with you , sir . Please leave us alone , " the younger teenager says in the video , while Zimmerman continues to rant about something in the background . " Mr Zimmerman , I don ' t know why you ' re here in Ferguson , but It ' s pretty damn insensitive , you showing up here . This town ' s been through enough already , we don ' t need you here intensifying things , okay ? And my friend and I didn ' t say anything to you . "
