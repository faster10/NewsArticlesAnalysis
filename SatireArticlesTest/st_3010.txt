" No , everyone knows they ' re going to take them all . They ' ll take all 10 . So if I buy 20 no wait Oh , I remember ! I ' ll hide them ! I ' ll bury them in the yard ! That way , the government won ' t get at them , and if I need them like if a burglar breaks into my house at night I won ' t be able to get at them either and no more questions . "
