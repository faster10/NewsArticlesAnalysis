Palin posted an image of the Confederate flag juxtaposed with the Planned Parenthood logo to her page , asking , " Which symbol killed 90 , 000 black babies last year ? " The controversial posting reportedly led Trump to intervene to make sure " we ' re all on the same page here with the important issues .

" I have a great relationship with the blacks , " Trump repeated . " I love the blacks . Also the Mexicans . "
