The " air plant " has been hailed as a marvel of modern technology . It works by sucking in huge quantities of polluted air upwards of 90 tons per day through vents around the county , which feed into pipelines leading to the plant . Once it reaches Nestl , the company separates the oxygen , carbon dioxide , and carbon monoxide . Large machines , called " scrubbers , " are able to extract the oxygen from carbon dioxide and monoxide and blend it in with the unpolluted oxygen processed by the plant , before pumping 70 of the freshly cleaned oxygen out through separate pipelines and back into the county .
