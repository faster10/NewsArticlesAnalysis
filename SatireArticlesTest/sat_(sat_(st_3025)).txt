The Reality : Barack Obama did support the green movement in Iran , secretly sending nearly 8 , 000 wind turbines to Tehran in the hopes they would drop their insistence on nuclear power and instead turn to renewable energies . Since the turbines came unassembled , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad unfortunately mistook the 8 , 000 metal poles for short , portable minarets , which he distributed to nomadic anti American clerics . The blades for the turbines , initially thought to be poorly made scimitars , were eventually given to madrasas and used to paddle impious 8 year olds , which in turn led to the formation of the RBB , or Red Buttocks Brigade , who rose up to challenge Ahmadinejad , but sadly failed as most of the children only rose up to 3 feet 9 inches tall .
