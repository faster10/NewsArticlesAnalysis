" If the president does not stop his socialist campaign against American economic liberty , " Senator Ted Cruz ( R TX ) said from the presidential campaign trail , " then we could have a true nightmare on our hands . " That nightmare , Cruz said , would come to pass " if Americans suddenly wake up to the fact that for all our rhetoric to the contrary , Democratic administrations shepherd our economy just fine . " Cruz further called the numbers into doubt as well . " Should we really trust the government ' s employment numbers if it ' s not a Republican in the White House , " Cruz asked , " I mean , isn ' t that really the crux of the issue , that we just can ' t trust that man because he ' s bla I mean , a black Democrat I mean a Democrat ? "
