" This one ' s gonna be a bear , no pun intended , " said ED nurse Annie Rogers , as she gives signout to one of the medical floor nurses , advising her to " put the patient in a room furthest from the nurse ' s station as humanly possible .

She added : " To be honest , there are times I ' d rather deal with actual live black bears and grizzlies running around this place than a patient with a teddy bear . "
