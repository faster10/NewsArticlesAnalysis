Where was I ? Oh yes , the gross little kid staring up at the TV screen , hands on the controls , fingers flickering savant like across the controller , mouth ajar with this not so much rapt as blank look on his face , dumbly manipulating some digital bovine breasted babe kick boxing with Ogres and Demons . I thought to myself , ' That ' s so sad . It ' s a shame we can ' t kill him . ' But we can ' t , ( it seems there are laws I checked ) , and more ' s the pity . I mean , when I was little I watched TV , sure . I got in some cartoons right after school , but then from 4 : 00 till dinner I was outside playing something cowboys , Civil War , cops and robbers anything that involved running around and going bang and pow a lot . Then dinner , homework , and another hour of The Monkees or Rat Patrol . But today ' s children spend an inordinate amount of in front of various screens , either video , TV or computer and as a result have become little butterballs of blandness with no imagination other than what ' s programmed into them by Sony or Nintendo .
