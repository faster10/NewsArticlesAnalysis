As a side note , the name for " Operation Strangerove " appears to have been inspired by the 1964 Stanley Kubrick film , " Dr Strangelove " . The film was a landmark in Kubrick ' s career , largely making fun of the fears of nuclear war at the time . Some say that this societal fear has been resurrected for " The War on Terror " , but the Bush administration has hotly refuted any parallels along these lines , as well as those to the Vietnam war .
