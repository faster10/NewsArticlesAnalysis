" Sadly , the rumors of the president ' s growing mental instability are true , " stated Cheney . " There has been a progressive decline in function , but he has noticeably deteriorated over the past week , as evidenced by his release of a highly classified national intelligence estimate to the public yesterday . In my capacity as vice president , I found it necessary to act aggressively at that point in the best interests of the security of America . I take no pleasure in assuming the mantle of the leader of the free world , but it is my sworn duty . "
