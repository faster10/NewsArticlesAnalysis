" I know that Ringo is growing senile and losing his mind , " says Sir Paul , " but he doesn ' t need to invent such idiotic stories to attract attention . He probably heard that Wings was about to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of fame and he felt jealous . I ' ve seen Ringo do and say many stupid things in my life , but this is one of the worst ! If he ' s so badly in need of media coverage , he could just invent crap about himself without implicating me in his delirium " he added with spite .
