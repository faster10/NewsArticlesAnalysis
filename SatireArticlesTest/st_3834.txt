Carl Palladino isn ' t doing so well in New York polls . But like Meg Whitman in California , when you ' re willing to spend millions of your own money to buy a political office , anything can happen . That still confuses me why would voters trust a person with their tax dollars who ' s so willing to piss away their own money on a low paying job ? Either they believe they ' re gonna get something big in return ( like major tax breaks on their own fortunes ) or they ' re just plain ego maniacs who think they can just step in and Bam ! change everything . Problem is , they succeeded in business cause they could A ) make decisions on their own and B ) could fire people who pissed em off . Welcome to state legislators and civil service workers , kids .
