My friend from up the street , who shall remain nameless so I won ' t get her in trouble for telling you this ( her name is Linda Paglione ) , just moved up to this area full time after growing up in Brooklyn , NY . She started this past school year by putting her little boy in the local Catholic school , 1st grade I think it was . She wanted a firm hand with this little hellion bear in mind , this is the kid who nicked me for like , 75 cents out of my change dish one day when they were visiting and when she confronted him , he lied through his baby teeth and refused to give it back . Ruffian .
