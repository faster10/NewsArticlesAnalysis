So I get to the airport and I ' m literally running to the gate , which I admit may have frightened a few people unnecessarily . I mean , I ' m kinda scary just at a canter . I get to the gate and look around and they ' re not there . My work colleagues . You know , my Four Horsemen . Turns out they ' re late . Why ? Well , remember the jackass ' who hit the ambulance ? Yup . It was Conflict . Naturally . The others were with him . So I ' m waiting and waiting but the airplane doors are going to close so I make one last call and it turns out Conflict got in an argument with the cops yeah , I know , shocker so now they ' re going to the station . But because Famine is in the car the cops decide they suddenly need to go to the doughnut shop first . So I ' m like Fine , nevermind , I ' ll do it myself , " ' and War is like , Hey no problem A Poc , we ' ll do this via GoToMeeting . " ' ( A Poc is my nickname , by the way . I ' m cool with it . ) Anyway , I say no we ' ll use Skype cause they were just bought by Microsoft , and that ' s more apocalyptic . I go in for that karmic stuff .
