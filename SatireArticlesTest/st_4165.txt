Isn ' t Sarah Palin sweet ? Rather than talking about serious policy changes , she ' s been running around trying to take our minds off the threat of the Second Great Depression . It ' s like " Scrubs " , you ' re laying in a hospital bed dying of cancer and Sarah is that relentlessly cheerful candy striper that bustles around the room telling jokes and dropping little tidbits of gossip about the doctors and staff , flashing you a perky smile , anything to avoid acknowledging how sick you are and how little the doctors can do to help you . It ' s nice .
