" In towns just like this one , there are many dark places where faith has gone , where confidence is swallowed up , and where the very life is squeezed out of the American worker . I come across those faces everywhere I go . As President , I will stand for the principle that every life matters the poor , the disabled and the unborn . I ' ll restore that faith , I ' ll restore that lost hope and I ' ll fill each and every glory hole up to the rim ! Join us ! Join us ! And let ' s take back America ! God bless you ! And God bless America ! "
