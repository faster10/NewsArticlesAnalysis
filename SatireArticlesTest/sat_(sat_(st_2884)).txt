Coming for the day ? Come hungry ! At Jamestown Settlement , we ' ve got loads of goodies , like 21 year old Goody Babbage , affectionately known around here as America ' s Founding Fodder . Watch in stunned awe as the innocent mistress Babbage steps out of her hut , is clubbed on the head , dismembered and parsed out to the delightful screams of children and adults alike . You can even take the remains home with you because at Jamestown Settlement , they ' re not just artifacts , they ' re eat ifacts !
