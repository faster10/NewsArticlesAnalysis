The British Medical Journal has released a report criticizing The United States and Great Britain lack of developing a death toll for Iraqi civilians killed during the invasion and occupation . Research conducted by The Lancet puts the number of innocent civilian deaths in excess of one hundred thousand while the British Foreign Office has documented the death toll at the somewhat lower number of three . Unnamed White House Source Wegman ( Pudgy ) Waterhouse , speaking on the condition of anonymity said , " We in the Administration have actually been very anxious to develop an accurate body count but the big problem has been that all those people look alike , at least the ones who still look like anything human at all , and we ' re afraid of double counting .
