" I was watching Celebrity Wife Swap ' a few weeks back , and they mentioned one of the celebrities was man named Coolio . My husband asked who that was , and I couldn ' t tell him . I couldn ' t think of a single thing he had done that made him a celebrity . We ' re pretty up to date with what ' s going on , but when I found out that Coolio did a whole series of shows in which he was simply a celebrity , " ' I felt like I was being lied to . "
