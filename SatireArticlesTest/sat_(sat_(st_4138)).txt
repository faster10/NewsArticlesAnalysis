Another Bush crony and close personal friend , Karen Hughes , undersecretary of state for public diplomacy , raised flaps in Turkey , Saudi Arabia and Egypt recently when she attempted to put a positive spin on the U . S . war in Iraq and Bush ' s policies . Although she lacked national experience , Hughes , a former journalist and PR consultant , helped Bush become governor in Texas and served as his communications director in the White House . Known for her personal loyalty and devotion , Hughes praised Bush as a strong and decisive boss , and defended him on TV . Perhaps that ' s why he appointed her to reach out to a hostile Muslim world .
