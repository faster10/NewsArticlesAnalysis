Vietnam Vet Jan Scruggs , who is actually a boy despite his first name , came up with the idea for the memorial during a screening of " The Dear Hunter . " After securing funds , a nationwide competition began for the design , which was won by architectural student Maya Ling , and building was completed in March of 1982 . The memorial consists of 482 feet of solid black granite upon which the names of soldiers who were classified as KIA ( Killed in Action ) or MIA ( Missing in Action ) are etched . Juxtaposed to most Washington monuments , which are made of white marble and reach out into the sky , the Vietnam Memorial actually sinks into the earth , symbolizing the burial of the 53 , 300 men and women who never made it home alive .
