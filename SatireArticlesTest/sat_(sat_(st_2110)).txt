The plastic coated menu was shabby and confusing as it seemed to be broken down by columns with Mexican on one side and American on the other . No pictures were presented to show what the dishes looked like , only crudely written descriptions , some of which were misspelled or so grammatically incorrect that it was all I could do to keep from busting out in politically incorrect laughter . I decided to have the three taco plate , two beef , or " carne de res , " one chicken , or " pollo . " My wife chose the pollo burrito plate , or sic britto as it was displayed in the menu . We placed our orders . I was immediately served a Coca cola in a similar hard plastic cup as the water was served . My wife was served her choice of a Corona with lime . I decided to refrain from alcohol in my growing disturbed state .
