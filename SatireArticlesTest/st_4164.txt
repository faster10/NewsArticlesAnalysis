It ' s Mr Wolf ' s apparent worry that the two things the potential use of illegal taps as legal evidence combined with the government ' s ability to seize assets before conviction is a legal nightmare . And he ' s absolutely right : combined with " Perfect Citizen " snooping around , it would be the perfect crime , the legal theft of assets based on normally inadmissible evidence illegally obtained by an entity who was breaking it ' s mandate in the first place by even looking for it . Pretty cool . Except now of course " Perfect Citizen " would remove a layer of illegality , but not in a good way . It ' s just making the crime legal . Isn ' t this a great country , or what ?
