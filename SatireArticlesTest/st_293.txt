" Man , I ' ve been there and it ' s a hard life to live , " said Aron . " No one in the family ever cared that I could play Billy Joel ' s ' Piano Man ' , which is all that I could do , but every day in high school some asshole would ask for that song so everyone could sing along . Do you know how annoying ' dah dah dah daaa dah dah dadada ' gets ? That shit stays with you forever man it haunts your dreams . "
