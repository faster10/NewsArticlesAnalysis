This highly biased , poorly thought out study used a simulation center at a local medical school , healthcare professionals of my choosing who knew what my goal endpoint would be , a really ugly and fragile yellow disposable stethoscope ( pseudostethoscope ) , and a used white Styrofoam cup from the nearly coffee area . My friends and colleagues listened to four basic sounds ( screaming , crying , cursing , and explosions ) using the two items , and I tested their proficiency using a protocol I made up as we went along . The study was sufficiently powered to achieve something .
