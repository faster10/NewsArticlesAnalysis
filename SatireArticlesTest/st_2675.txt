After the rally , Trump was assailed with questions from the press corps . One reporter asked if what Mr Trump was proposing was just a dressed up concentration camp . " Yes , of course it ' s a concentration camp , " Trump bellowed , " We built it so that Muslims can concentrate on being less Muslimish . " Trump said that expecting people to " drop any and all cultural ties to their mother country helps create a homogenized environment where people who are different aren ' t treated as well " and that this is " completely in line with what America is really all about . "
