A basket of corn tortilla chips with two sauces were placed in front of us along with the menus and waters in red , hard plastic cups . The sauces appeared cloudy , like the water . My wife agreed to try the red sauce while I cautiously sampled the green . I placed a tiny dab on a chip and sniffed it . A peppery sensation filled my nose but did not seem overly strong . I tasted the sauce . It had a bite , relieved that it did not bring about any sense of nausea or distaste . My wife complimented the red sauce . I tried a few chips of each before becoming bored .
