The buffalo ' s lawsuit concerns a period of time in the mid 1800 ' s , a time which they are referring to as the " Holocaust of Buffalo " . They claim that the Union Pacific promoted the shooting of buffalo by passengers on their trains , so as to ensure that the rails would not be blocked by crossing herds . Due to this " senseless , violent action " , the buffalo ' s numbers which had previously ranked in the millions decreased to mere thousands .
