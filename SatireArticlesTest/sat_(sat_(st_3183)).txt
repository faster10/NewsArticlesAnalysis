DRMALCOLM : You want to sit ? COLE08 : I am sitting . DRMALCOLM : How about we play a mind reading game ? I ' ll read your mind . If I ' m right , you type . If I ' m wrong , you type . If I ' m wrong twice , you can log off . Deal ? COLE08 : I ' m nodding yes , but too wary to type ' Yes . ' DRMALCOLM : OK , I ' m pressing my fingers to my temples and my eyes are shut , just like a mind reader . Now COLE08 : How can you type with your fingers on your temples and your eyes shut ? DRMALCOLM : Wow , you are scaring me with your prescience , but I am smiling benignly . OK , now , just before your mom and dad divorced , she went to a shrink like me and it didn ' t help her . And so you think I ' m not going to help you . COLE08 : DRMALCOLM : You have a secret . But you don ' t want to tell me . COLE08 : DRMALCOLM : You ' re a good student in school , and never get in trouble . COLE08 : We were supposed to draw a picture in school . I drew a man whose Internet revenue model was fatally flawed . The company folded . Nobody liked my picture . Now I only draw happy Internet pictures . Lots of pretty bubbles . DRMALCOLM : Let ' s pause here to build tension . COLE08 : What am I thinking now ? DRMALCOLM : I I don ' t know . COLE08 : I was thinking , you ' re nice . But you can ' t help me until Act II Scene VI .
