DVM Daniel Yost , the veterinarian who was in charge of Buddy ' s subsequent necropsy after the outbreak manifested elaborates further . " Rabies is a highly contagious virus . We have observed a change in attitude when it comes to vaccinating pets here in Orange county . Many owners decline despite the obvious risks and now we are seeing the consequences roll in . Essentially , with Buddy ' s case , we have a dog who arrives infected to a dog park where several other un vaccinated animals are also playing . He not only interacts with several other animals but he also urinates , defecates and drinks water from a communal style watering system which becomes contaminated with his saliva . Even after Buddy left the park , any other un vaccinated animal entering the park could potentially become infected . These infected animals in turn , infect other un vaccinated animals and now we have the catastrophic situation unfolding that you see now . "
