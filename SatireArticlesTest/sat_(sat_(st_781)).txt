A garbage dump can smell pretty bad , but it just doesn ' t reek of fresh melena , purulent discharge , and C . diff like a good ole medicine service . A garbage dump is covered daily with soil ( by choice ) . A medicine service is covered daily with stool , urine , saliva , blood , MRSA , paperwork , and complaints ( not by choice ) . Waste compaction at a garbage dump is good . Bowel disimpaction on a medicine service is bad . A garbage dump produces greenhouse gases from the decay of its waste . A medicine service produces angst and burnout from the decay of its morale .
