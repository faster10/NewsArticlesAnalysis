O ' Neil also says he isn ' t worried that his announcement will cause much of a panic , either . " It ' s been the science community ' s experience over the years that the public doesn ' t concern itself with much more than imminent danger . We ' ve been warning about the adverse affects of climate change for decades , but even today , with droughts and wildfires and record hurricanes , there are people who simply don ' t care , or question the validity of the science . So chances are most people won ' t even realize the danger this comet is imposing on us . "
