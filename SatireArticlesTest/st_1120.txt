Despite developing a necrotizing skin reaction at her vitamin K C infusion site which has spread to claim her left pinky , Hootro remains defiantly optimistic : " I can ' t believe those MD quacks I was seeing before missed my B . hominis infestation . I could have gotten septic any minute ! It ' s their fault that my leaky gut has progressed this far . A few more nips from Griff ' s teat should help me turn the corner though . She is unvaccinated , free range , and eats only organic Whole Foods leftovers that Dr Bob personally scrounges for . I should probably email Dr Bob and tell him I ' ve been scared to death to drink any water this week and I ' ve been foaming at the mouth more than usual . Probably my fatigued adrenals acting up . "
