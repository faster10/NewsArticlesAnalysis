Now here ' s the thing : if we move Christmas to April , we can keep the Christmas gift giving part of it right where it is now , on December 25th , or the Solstice on December 21st , another astronomical event . We keep Saint Nick but switch to calling him Father Xmas or Fred or Jared for that matter . The tree , the lights , celebrations , drunken driving and most importantly , the buying of many , many gifts all stay the same . We just remove all traces of religion from what would otherwise be a joyous occasion . Simple .
