The fact is , CNN has really become irrelevant . The Right and the Left are sewn up , the Weather Channel ' s got , well , the weather and no one wants to hear the Middle . Maybe they can become " news critics " like Stewart and Colbert but seriously , telling us , " Fox News reported this and here ' s where they lied " " MSNBC said this without a shred of evidence . " and " The Car Guys Were Wrong About The Ford Focus Muffler " . Their new tagline could be " Resorting To Reporting " , a sort of televised FactCheck . org . Or they could just show re runs of the good old days when they were an important part of our lives .
