" Just last week I saw some hippie looking guy walking down the street , and instead of pushing a baby carriage down the street , he was carrying a guitar , " lamented Jen Borowski , resident of the neighborhood since 2002 . " This neighborhood has changed so much since my husband and I moved in , and not for the better . We don ' t want a place where the bartender talks to us as if he were our equal , but sooner or later this place is going to get too full of hippies and rejects for a place like Zella to survive . "
