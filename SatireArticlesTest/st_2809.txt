We as women have to realize that our bodies are a huge distraction for men . Wearing revealing clothing , clothing specifically designed to lead men into temptation , is a sin against God , against men , and against ourselves . It is our responsibility as Christian women to be of modest dress and to keep the minds of men pure and focused on Christ . It is grossly unfair to tempt men with our bodies , and then to cry rape when we so clearly brought it upon ourselves with our sinful and revealing clothes . Men cannot be held responsible for their actions when women are at fault for leading them into shameful behavior .
