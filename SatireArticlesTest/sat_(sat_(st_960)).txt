" These med students are shining bright , " admitted nurse Elaine Rivers . " More importantly , they ' re no longer hogging our computers . " She points to her favorite med student , Julie Jenkins , in Room 2120 . " She ' s an all star . She doesn ' t drop a thing and can stand hours on one leg . Horrible C . diff ? Not a peep out of her . Things I love about her ? She makes a BEEP sound when her patient ' s arm isn ' t straight . She also let ' s patients have it if they go out for a smoke . Amazing . "
