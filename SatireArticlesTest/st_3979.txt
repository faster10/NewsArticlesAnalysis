Children have , for the last half century or so , been ganging up their good days , as it were the cynical thought here seems to be that as long as you ' re good in the several weeks leading up to Christmas , you can be bad during the rest of the year . This may fool your parents , who are no doubt pitifully grateful for any nano second of peace and quiet you give them , but it ' s not fooling me . Children who practice this form of moral subterfuge are not ' good ' in the accepted sense of the word , they ' re just pretending to be good for only as long as they feel it ' s necessary to achieve some monetary gain . This is not true The Spirit Of Christmas .
