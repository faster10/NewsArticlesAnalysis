CDC researcher Dr Jane Withnall advised Americans to avoid politics if possible and be aware that symptoms might not develop immediately . " Keep in mind that if someone is showing signs of CBTBI on a Monday , it may be because of something that Newt Gingrich or Al Sharpton or Rush Limbaugh said last Friday , " she said . Withnall does not , however , advise voters to wear helmets until the elections . " In this case a helmet would simply become a readily available object to beat their own heads with . "
