Sometimes Orthopedics will consult Medicine for hypertension management on a patient that has one medication , hydrochlorothiazide 12 . 5 mg . Other times if the patient has type II diabetes and is on metformin , Medicine will be consulted to hold the metformin during their hospital stay and maybe sign the insulin order set for a possible sliding scale . If Internal Medicine gets lucky they will be able to dictate the discharge summary , because once the surgery is over they are no longer a surgical case it will have " morphed " into a Medicine patient .
