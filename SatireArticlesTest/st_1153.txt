Coding Administrators will be on every floor and will follow all physicians and nurses to ensure proper documentation and coding . " Our ICD 10 coding will be so meticulous , almost to a micromanaging level , with watching every entry physicians and nurses make during the week , " said Waters . " This way we will ensure maximum reimbursement . We have already developed apps capable of figuring out codes that produce more revenue . If there is a disagreement between the physician ' s diagnosis and the administrator ' s code , well we will of course go with the more lucrative coding from the administrator . "
