Here ' s what you do . When you arrive at the office on Friday morning , remind people that you have to pick up your cousin in the evening . Then , at 4 : 15 , get up from your computer as if you ' re going to the restroom . But instead , head to the back storage nook by the testing lab , grab your messenger bag and coat which you stashed there earlier and slip out the west fire exit . If anyone asks where you ' re headed , just yell , " Coffee run . " and keep walking .
