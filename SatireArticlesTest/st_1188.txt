In the event you can ' t escape the hospital or clinic for greener pastures , then simply play the medical version of hide and seek from the angry patient until the next morning . Avoid the floor that contains the angry patient and if possible bury anything through which you might be reached : phone , pager , computer , house . Sure , there ' s only a 0 . 000001 chance that he or she will not be angry in the morning , but isn ' t that a chance worth taking ? If the angry patient finds you before the morning ? Scream " Tag ! You ' re it and run away .
