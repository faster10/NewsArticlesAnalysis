" What if it were Couricgate and not Rathergate ? " rhetorically asked Dale Marshal of Dover , PA , in reference to the falsified reports that Dan Rather read over the evening news during the 2004 Presidential campaign stating that Bush was documented as having gone AWOL during national guard service . " Everyone would have put it up to just another dumb blond making another dumb blond mistake , but with Rather ' s intense seriousness and believability , my buddies and I had a field day at the VFW about America ' s liberal bias in the media . How can we do that when it ' s a woman giving us the news , who we know is going to say stupid things ? This ruins the credibility of our arguments that the media lacks credibility . "
