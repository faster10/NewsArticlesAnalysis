Marijuana , which is known in scientific circles as the Devil ' s Weed , is a drug renowned for its ability to drive normal citizens to the brink of insanity . A 2004 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine decisively showed that if marijuana were legalized nationwide , 299 million people would become violently ill , vomit blood , and viciously kill one another , much like in the Drug War documentary 28 Days Later . The remaining one million Americans would be so hungry from the " munchies " that they would cannibalize one another until all of the world went extinct .
