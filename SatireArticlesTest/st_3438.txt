Waterhouse may have a valid point . While he may have no chance of winning himself , if he can keep his recent momentum going for another couple months he can be assured of two things FOX News , who does have enough money and twelve year olds on their staff to generate a boyishly good looking , tall , tanned and toned fictional character , will most certainly hire him as a talking head for a million a year ( just look at Sarah Palin ) and the Koch brothers , who are spending billions in pocket change to buy every candidate they can find , will probably keep him on the payroll , just in case . after all , they ' ve never let reality get in the way of a good return on an investment yet .
