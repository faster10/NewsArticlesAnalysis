Once the backup is installed , consider what kind of spare it is before attempting to drive off . Why ? To cut costs , some countries come equipped with miniaturized , space saving governments for use in emergencies . While these smaller spares make sense for compact , lightweight countries , where room is a concern , bigger , heavier nations should really come with full sized spares to handle the load . The backup U . S . government is quite small , and therefore should not be used for long periods or at speeds above 35 miles per hour . As soon as you can , go , but slowly , to your nearest national capital and see about getting a real government .
