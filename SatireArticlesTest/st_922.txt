The researchers watched five episodes of each show , and evaluated the validity of each claim made on the shows . Each individual claim was rated on a scale of 5 ( " strongly supported by the literature " ) to 5 ( " directly contradicted by the literature " ) , with 0 representing " insufficient data to support or refute the claim . " When the results were tallied , and an average score was calculated , the result was clear . With a score of 0 . 57 to 3 . 73 , Doc McStuffins was clearly the more science based show .
