" How freaky to think about the possibily that a virtual currency could replace the U . S . Dollar , " said GOP strategist , Emma Faye Kerr . Ms . Kerr continued , " If that ever happened , the entire economy would be replaced by a sort of virtual economy , where everybody , including the government , loses connection with the reality based world . Thank God we have a President that is still in touch with reality , who has decided to take action against the threat of virtual worlds replacing the real world . "
