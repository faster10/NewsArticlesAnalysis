One person Sarah Palin is not apologizing to is the former boyfriend of her daughter , Bristol , Levi Johnston . He recently claimed that Palin referred to her son Trig , who has Down Syndrome , as " retarded " . This week while promoting his " Playgirl " shoot , Johnston said that his ex future mother in law made it a point to make certain that there would be an audio version of her memoir out the same day as the hard cover version . Johnston maintains Palin wanted this because " there are plenty of illiterate intellectuals who have solid Christian values . We shouldn ' t exclude them . "
