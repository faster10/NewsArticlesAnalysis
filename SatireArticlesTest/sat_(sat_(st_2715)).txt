Las Vegas private investigator , Thomas Starling , says Senecal is still the number one suspect in Shakur ' s murder and is working to collect enough evidence to prove it . " He was there , had the motive , and one or two more pieces of the puzzle will blow this case wide open , " said Starling . " Hopefully the Secret Service and FBI do their job and spend the time and resources needed to bring this monster to justice . Tupac ' s family and fans deserve nothing less . "
