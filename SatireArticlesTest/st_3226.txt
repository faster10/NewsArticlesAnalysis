Sorry I ' m late . I know some of you were counting on me . But seriously , I had a hell of a day . Starts this morning . I ' m at home packing my stuff just a carry on as I refuse to pay 25 for a checked bag when Mrs Apocalypse comes in and says she doesn ' t want me to go . Says she has a bad feeling about today ' and I ' m like , Yeah , well , me too . I think that ' s the point . " ' But I convince her that I ' ll be fine , ( unlike everyone else right ? ) , but she ' s all weepy and has me wait and say goodbye to all the little Apocalypses , which I do . So I ' m already late , and the cab is sitting there racking up the meter . Then I ' m 10 miles from home when I realize I forgot my wallet , which I need because I ' ve got one of those Clear passes , to Fly through airport security . " ' Love that thing . And yeah , I ' m not on the no fly list . Me off all people , right ? Anyway , we ' re halfway to the airport when we get in this massive traffic jam . Some jackass rear ended an ambulance in the breakdown lane . Wasn ' t me , if that ' s what you ' re thinking .
