I don ' t think we should be too quick to forget that everyone involved in the 20 minutes of murder had been drinking and had recently listened to AC DC . In my opinion , the culture of excessive partying that we ' ve created in America is simply appalling . I equally blame the cultures of video games , baseball violence , knife play , religions other than my own , and raw denim . What do young people expect to happen to them when they become intoxicated to the point of losing consciousness ?
