Spending money to support the old , sick and stupid is not going to get our country anywhere . Taking care of the old is wasted money , what are these people going to do for us now ? That goes for the sick as well , if they can ' t be productive then we should pull the plug , unless like they can help us firm up the Republican base , like Teri Schavio . As far as giving money to the poor , screw ' em if they can ' t make their own way . It just isn ' t the government ' s fault or responsibility to take care of these people , who probably don ' t go to church anyway .
