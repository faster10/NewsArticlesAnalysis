Monica Hobbes , an NP student wasn ' t so lucky . " I had a patient with chronic low back pain who was out of MS Contin 30 ' s . He wanted a 90 day refill . I told him we do not refill narcotic pain medication in the ER . His ring went from green to yellow . I got nervous , began to sweat and felt palpitations . I really need to do well on this clinical and get a good grade ! I could not let him ruin it , so I offered him Tramadol . It turned orange . I got desperate and offered Tylenol 3 . The ring turned red , then black . I didn ' t know what to do so I just ran out of the room sobbing . "
