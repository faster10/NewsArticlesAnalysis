Kid Rock described the song as " A love letter to the south and a middle finger to the PC establishment . " Nugent , author of such songs as : Wang Dang Sweet Poontang , Lovejacker , and Saddle Sore , is no stranger to controversy when it comes to his music . " Rock n ' Roll ain ' t supposed to be nice , it ' s supposed to hit you upside the head with a tire iron , and that is exactly what this song does , " Nugent said .
