Phillips , age 46 , currently lives with his mother in Bovill , Idaho . " Because I know the truth behind what the US Government is doing to us , I ' ve been prevented from obtaining employment . " he explains . " Government shills were employed to spread rumors about me around town . That , and my mother ' s health is why I ' ve never moved out . She needs me . If I wasn ' t here , who knows what the Government would do to her simply to try and get to me ? "
