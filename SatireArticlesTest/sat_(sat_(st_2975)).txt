All we have to do is , at the beginning of the admissions process , in early Fall , we all get together and rub the bull testicles on our foreheads . Naked . We also have to be naked when we do this , that ' s according to our admissions director , Mr Hartswell , who is well versed in these things . So , we all gather naked in the pool did I mention we stand at the shallow end of an Olympic swimming pool filled with crude oil ? and we rub the bull testicles on our heads , and then the strobe lights come on . That ' s part of the magic . And then Mr Hartswell , who ' s sitting up in the lifeguard chair , pushes a button and 7 , 000 pounds of chicken feathers floats down on us .
