" America needs Chris Christie , and come January of 2017 , that ' s who America is going to have , " Murrell continued . " America needs a President who knows what it means to love and cherish our Constitution . A president who knows what it means to be hungry for change , hungry for the future , hungry just generally . This is just a minor early campaign setback , but you watch The Republican party is taking over in 2016 , and when it comes to Obamacare , Benghazi , and everything else Obama screwed up , America is going to learn that elephants never forget . I mean the Republican elephant , not well , you get what I mean . "
