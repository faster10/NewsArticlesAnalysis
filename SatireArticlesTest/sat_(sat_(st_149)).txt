53 year old Bettina H bers , who works as a caretaker at an old people ' s home in Berlin , claims her mother , Erika H bers , had an affair with the British musician between 1959 and 1962 . At the time the Beatles were playing on Hamburg ' s infamous Reeperbahn and hadn ' t yet risen to fame . Ms . H bers had a failed pop career under the name Tina McCartney , but Sir Paul has always denied he was her father , and the original paternity test backed up his claims . In 2007 , however , she claimed that McCartney had faked the paternity test , as she alleged that a look alike had taken Sir Paul ' s place in the court case .
