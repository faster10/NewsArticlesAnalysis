On September 7 , in the first court case on Gulf War I to reach Federal Court , nine veterans from a National Guard unit argued their case before a judge in New York , claiming the Army violated its own safety protocols by exposing them to radioactive depleted uranium and refusing to provide medical care . Representing the US Army , Assistant US Attorney John Cronan asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit immediately because courts can ' t decide " sensitive military matters " and a 1950 Supreme Court decision ruled that soldiers can ' t sue the government for injuries caused by their military service . The Court has not reached a decision .
