In the speech , Bush attacks many of the administrations key policies . He leaves no room to question his commitment to changing the culture in Washington . He has sworn to reverse what he called the ' ruinous ' fiscal and environmental polices of the current government . He even went so far as to say that he wouldn ' t have invaded Iraq on faulty intelligence , unlike those in control now . Bush has made it clear that if he gets the top job thing will really be different .
