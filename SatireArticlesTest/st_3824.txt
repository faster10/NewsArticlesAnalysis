He told me I didn ' t need an appointment and to just show up . On Monday morning I went to this hospital and asked the front desk for Dr John . They asked , " do you have an appointment ? " I told them no but he knew I was coming . Dr John came down the the lobby to greet me within two minutes . He led me up to his office . There was no waiting . I felt as if I was the only patient he had .
