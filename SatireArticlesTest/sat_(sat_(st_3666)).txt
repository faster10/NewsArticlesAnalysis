Twas the night before Christmas here in the White House . Laura was sleeping and the twins had passed out . Their stockings and spike heels were strewn everywhere , while I sat there thinking , ' It just isn ' t fair ' . Here it was Christmas and everything sucked . Life really stinks when you ' re just a Lame Duck . Nobody called , so I sat there alone My polls are so low even Cheney won ' t phone . No Angela Merkel , no Ehud Olmert no Vladimir Putin , they all think I ' m a jerk .
