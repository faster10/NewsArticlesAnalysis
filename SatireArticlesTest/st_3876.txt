Well , I just couldn ' t believe it , so I went straight away to Our Lady of the Church 2 Streets Up On The Left to find out what was going on . The school still looked the same it was like someone had taken Joliet Penitentiary and plugged it into the side of a Church . There was an older Nun standing on the side steps . As I walked up to her she saw me and dropped something on the step and ground it out with her heel . A thin wisp of smoke drifted from the corner of her mouth and she swallowed hard . Tears came into her eyes .
