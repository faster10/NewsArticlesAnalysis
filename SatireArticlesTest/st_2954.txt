So , Class of 2011 , how many times this week have you been told to " follow your dreams ? Six times ? A dozen ? Your teachers , your parents , your advisors , they all tend to give advice like that . Probably you ignore it . Well , maybe I ' m getting old , but I actually agree with them . You should follow your dreams . You should pursue your goals . You should give life to your ideas , wherever they lead . As trite as it sounds , I want you to truly believe that you can be anything you want to be and do anything absolutely anything you want to do . Unless , that is , it competes with me . Then you will fail .
