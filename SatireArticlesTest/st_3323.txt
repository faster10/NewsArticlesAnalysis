I am not a soldier , nor have I ever been one . The closest I ' ve come to war was listening to the stories of my Uncle John , a decorated veteran of World War II . Some of those stories , including one from a book written by a fellow soldier that mentions John by name , spoke of friendly fire incidents ( John inadvertanly almost burned him to death with a flame thrower when the two came on a house from different directions and these guys were buddies ) and civilians caught in the war zone , in this case France and Belgium in the summer of 1944 . These were friendly countries controlled by our then enemy , Nazi Germany . In that war , in Europe alone , millions of civilians died in carpet bombings , tank battles , artillery barrages , you name it . The Allied forces were probably responsible for most of those deaths , yet today Europeans still commemorate fallen Allied soldiers in cemeteries around their countries .
