While this reporter started swallowing Xanax by the fist full , Waterhouse rambled on , " Anyway , pretty soon we ' ll need more Americans to replace the fallen . Here ' s where we solve the immigration problem . We ' ll have to import fighting men and women mercenaries , I think they ' re called , as our own people go K . I . A . If they can contribute , and by that I mean loot , enough on our behalf , say , twenty thousand dollars per immigrant , they immediately become citizens as a reward . No more messy immigration problems , only the best and strongest , or at least the ones left alive , become Americans . And it ' s also the answer to answer the whole language thing , we only issue " incoming fire " warnings in English . That ' ll make foreign people learn American pretty darn quick , I ' ll tell you . "
