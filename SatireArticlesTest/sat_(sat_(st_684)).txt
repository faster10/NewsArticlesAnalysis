" I remember watching little Andy down the street grow up and play Cowboys and Indians with my little boys , " reminisced Pete Brownstone , contractor , of Bloomington , IN , about former neighbor and felled soldier Andrew Seiks . " I saw him transform a man all the way up until he joined the Army and was shipped out to fight in Iraq where he was killed by a roadside bomb intended to destroy the precious fuel inside the kick ass Humvee he was driving . I would go to his funeral today , but I ' ll be goddamned if they didn ' t raise the price of gasoline again , so it looks like I ' ll be phoning in my regrets . "
