WASHINGTON , D . C . Outgoing Speaker of the House John Boehner has set a date for the election to decide his replacement . All eyes are now on Rep . Paul Ryan ( R WI ) , as in the last few days it has become increasingly clear that he may be the only candidate in the entire Republican conference that enough of the various factions can get behind , which is one of many demands that Ryan has put on his decision to run for Speaker . Ryan has demanded total unity from his conference , including a rule change that would keep him securely in the Speakership without hardliners having any chance to pick him off , should he find himself on their bad side , but another one of Ryan ' s condition ' s also has some within his party balking .
