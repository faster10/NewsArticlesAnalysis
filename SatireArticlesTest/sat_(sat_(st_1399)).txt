" I love using these new DoYouEvenLift Gelpis ! They weigh 56 lbs . , so I can get a SIIIIIIIIICK curl in before I use them to retract , " says Dr Luke McStash , orthopaedic trauma surgeon at Harlorside Hospital in California . " During a case I asked for a new DoYouEvenLift depth gauge . It was 10lbs , not too bad . A Bennett was 38lbs that was better , but then I asked for my go to : Large Rongeur . I use that bad boy for everything from shaping bone to clamping off small bleeders . I was so happy that Synthesis made a DoYouEvenLift version , 134 lbs . . "
