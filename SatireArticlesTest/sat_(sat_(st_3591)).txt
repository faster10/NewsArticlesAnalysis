In August 2004 , the VA reported that over 518 , 739 Persian Gulf veterans were on medical disability since 1991 . Moret attributes many of these disabilities to DU exposure . Although some remain controversial , Moret compiled a list of 100 illnesses that veterans associated with DU , including brain tumors , Hodgkin lymphoma , leukemia , rectal cancer , Parkinson ' s disease , respiratory problems , rashes , kidney and eye problems , and thyroid cancer . Others point to definite connections between DU and brain tumors , and Hodgkin and non Hodgkin lymphoma .
