A study by the Pacific Research Institute , " The U . S . Economic Freedom Index : 2004 Report , " is an example of business friendly attitudes , assuming that economic freedom can be measured by workers migrating to places where they can economically prosper and away from poorer areas . While recognizing that the study doesn ' t deal with people who are attracted to urban areas for their diversity and many amenities , it defines migration as " a market based response to economic freedom . " After measuring 143 " variables , " the study declares that changes in gasoline , cigarette and inheritance taxes , and increases in welfare payments , determined changes in states ' ranking since 1999 . States that increased welfare and government regulation fell in the rankings , while those that cut taxes , welfare and regulation rose .
