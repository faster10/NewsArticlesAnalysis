This spectacular new find adds even more to the aura of the site , which is one of the most famous in all of archaeology . Digging at Hisarlik in Turkey in 1868 , the wealthy German businessman and archaeologist , Heinrich Schliemann , uncovered the ruins of several cities , built one on top of the other . He discovered in the lowest one , a cache of gold and other objects in May 1873 , that he mistakenly named " Priam ' s Treasure " . He later wrote that he had seen the gold glinting in the dirt and then had dismissed the workmen so that he and and his wife Sophia could excavate it themselves .
