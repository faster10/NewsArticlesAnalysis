When asked if this meant that he would be leaving politics , Mr Rove concluded : " I think it was a Republican Senator , Newt Gingrich , that once said , " It ' s all politics . " I have been approached by a couple of the Republican presidential contenders campaigns , and I do love a challenge . While it may be the right thing to do , I think this whole 9 11 thing is something of a dead horse at this point , and it might be a tough sell for a candidate attempting to present himself as a hero , but it ' s salvageable . I think the new theme for the race will be simply " Law and Order " and anyone able to wrap themselves up in that will be in like Flint . "
