The castle was managed by Bruno and Antoinette de Ferrieres de Sauvebeuf from 1978 until January 2009 , when Mr Ferrieres de Sauvebeuf passed away , followed by his wife a few months later . Le Plessis Bourr remained until that time , one of the few french castles inhabited by its owner . Upon the death of the couple in 2009 , a long and extremely complicated legal battle began between the heirs over the possession of the castle , as many relatives of the deceased contested the couple ' s legal will which bequeathed everything to the homeless Louis douard Reille Soult , a distant relative of Antoinette .
