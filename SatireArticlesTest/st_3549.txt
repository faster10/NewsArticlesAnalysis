( Wyoming Minnesota ) A billboard with a picture of a smiling George W . Bush paired with a caption " Miss Me Yet ? " is drawing attention to the small town . The ad was taken out by a group of small business owners who prefer to remain anonymous . The message they believe voices the majority of many Americans , that government should stay out of the pockets of business owners and not increase taxes that will only go to help those less fortunate . George W . Bush was asked for a comment . But the former President said that unfortunately Dick Cheney was unavailable , so he really didn ' t know how to respond .
