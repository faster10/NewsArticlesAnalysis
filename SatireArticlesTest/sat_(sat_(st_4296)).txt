Nuking Iran will send a positive message . It ' s obvious that invading Iraq and getting our butts beat is not sending the right kind of message . We need a new one . The Arab world needs to know that the USA is the one and only super power and we aim to keep it that way . Dropping the big one on Tehran will be like saying , " Don ' t mess with the USA baby ! " This type of strong signal will put a real damper on extremism across the Arab world . Terrorist thugs and criminals with realize that attacking the USA is futile and just get on with their lives instead of wasting them on some stupid Anti USA jihad .
