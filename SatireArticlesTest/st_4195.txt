Yeah , it would be great to believe that ' normal ' Americans , the nice ones who hold the door for strangers , bend over to pick up something someone else dropped , smile and nod as they walk past you the ones who do this regardless of your skin color , or whether you ' re wearing a yarmulke , dreadlocks or headscarf the ones who don ' t care if your worship day is Friday , Saturday or Sunday or not at all , are suddenly sitting up and saying , " Wait a minute , these folks are going too far . Sure , taxes are high and yes , the borders have become dangerous because we keep buying drugs from the Mexican Cartels and there are corrupt and self serving politicians out there . Of course there are a lot of things wrong with America there ' s always a lot of things wrong with America but these folks are just going too far . " ( boy , what a long sentence that was ) . Maybe some of them are too .
