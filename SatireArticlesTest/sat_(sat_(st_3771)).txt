" This is a wonderful day for democracy . " Said the President as he spoke with the group of Iraqi insurgents during the broadcast . " I ' m so glad that you men have decided that is was futile to fight the forces of democracy and have decided to join us in building a new America friendly Iraq . I promise that if you all let us pumps lots of oil we will leave you alone . I sure hope all this fighting hasn ' t ruined our chances at being good friends . I would like to have you over to the ranch for a pig roast . "
