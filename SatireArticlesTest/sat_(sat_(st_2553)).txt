You ' ll see and hear fistfights throughout the parking lot and inside a The Phish concert . It is inevitable that someone has a bag of dope or that one tape recording of the " hottest show " of the tour and won ' t let it go for under 100 bucks . Tapers record The Phish and later sell massively produced records and compacted discs at later shows for top dollar amounts . A ticket to a show might cost a person 50 , but the recording of the show is going to run the phan at least twice that amount . The drums on those unprofessionally recorded shows will sound like tin cans and the keyboards like kazoos when listening to the output of heavily distorted microphones hung haphazardly by lsd freaked tech wannabees . Whole guitar breaks will be lost during fumbled tape flips and there ' s always some screaming lunatic destroying the softer passages of the recording with insane howling or screaming , not that any phan actually listens that closely . Also , a phan will covet his ticket like a bum covets a jug of cheap wine .
