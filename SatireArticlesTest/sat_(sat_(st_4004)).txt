What makes the Tea Party so dangerous is the fact that they seemingly have no real political goal , no identifiable agenda , other than a free floating rage at Barack Obama . And although the things that enraged them the housing bubble and subsequent economic collapse , the Wall Street debacle , the Great Recession , our massive national debt , the ruinous war in Iraq and the near loss of Afghanistan , all happened during and were the result of a Republican administration , they don ' t seem to care . It ' s all about stopping Barack Obama now , no matter what he tries to do .
