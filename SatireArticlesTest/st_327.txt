Gibson ' s charitable work has garnered him the respect and admiration of his peers . " I remember when I was in high school , if we couldn ' t find anyone ' s older brother to buy us booze , we would be forced to huff Freon , do whip its , or rip bongs of pot all night , " said line cook Phil Taylor . " But if someone like Gibbs Gibson ' s nickname amongst the staff had been around for us back then , maybe we could have avoided all that and learned a healthy respect for drinking alcohol that didn ' t involve chugging mouthwash .
