OK , so we take off , and the flight is OK except I ' m sitting next to one of those white knuckle guys who keeps saying , I have a bad feeling about this , " ' and I ' m like , No , that ' s just me . " ' Now we get to Atlanta and it turns out I missed my connection . Which you probably figured by now . And of course there ' s a long line for the gate agent to rebook flights and I ' m frustrated . So I cut in line and tell the agent I have to be somewhere by six and the guy behind me is like , Hey buddy we all have to be somewhere by six ' and I ' m like , No , you won ' t be anywhere by six . " ' And I use my Apocalypse Voice . Which I shouldn ' t but I was angry .
