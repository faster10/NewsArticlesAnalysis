But they don ' t ( mostly because the Tea Party being wrong about something isn ' t really ' news ' anymore ) and Juan Williams did and now he ' s crying " Censorship ! " and Fox is giving him millions and having a grand old time ragging on a real news organization . And before you get all Tea ' d off ( Get it ? Tea ' d off ? Pretty good , huh ? ) , I don ' t watch to MSNBC for the same reason . I want news , not opinions , especially stupid ones , from either the Left or Right . I ' ll make up my own mind , such as it is , thank you .
