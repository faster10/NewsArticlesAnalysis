The mosh pit at a The Phish concert is entered at the risk of personal injury or even death . Get too close to the stage or cross in front of one of the deranged druggies and you ' ll be lucky to come away with only a black eye , bruises , and possibly a broken limb . Others aren ' t so lucky . Phans at The Phish concerts brazenly leap and jiggle to the acid rock beats coming at them from the stage . Fists and elbows fly and legs kick out with no regard . On the average , a hundred kids are beaten to the point of hospitalization at the Phish shows because they ventured into the mosh pit and got caught up in the senseless violence . Dozens are trampled to death each tour . Police are ready with riot gear at The Phish shows to confront the violence clearly the result of carelessly ingested narcotics .
