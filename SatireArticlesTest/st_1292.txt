The goal of this study was to identify BS early in the ED workup , and apply aggressive exit door directed therapy ( EDDT ) . The physicians and nurses involved were instructed to initiate the BS protocol when four of the BS criteria were met . This activates the entire hospital system of a possible BS situation . These patients are immediately seen by the hospital ' s BS Intervention Team , who come down to re assess the patient . If BS is suspected , the patient may then be given a lengthy lecture about the purpose of an emergency department , the dangers of ED misuse , and discussion about the critically sick patients who will receive less attention and care secondary to other patients ' BS behaviors .
