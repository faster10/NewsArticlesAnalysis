To me Arab Spring was a carefree trend , like the overthrow . It was so spontaneous , like I don ' t care what my government looks like , let ' s just throw on any damn thing . " ' It was an out with the old ' atmosphere . But of course most of that so called old stuff doesn ' t get thrown away . It ' s like chiffon or lace doilies . Always comes back . So I think in most cases you ' ll see the Arabs take that old look and dress it up a bit . Still restrictive and stifling , but just a hint of the new . Maybe a little off the shoulder , a soup on of freedom . Perfumes will be muted too . Nothing overthrowing . Maybe just the slightest hint of democracy . But not so much that you turn heads or attract undue official attention .
