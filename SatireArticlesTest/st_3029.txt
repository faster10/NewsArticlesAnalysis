" ' So Shelley , who owns the coffee shop and is the only woman in our group , she says , Gentlemen ? What about me ? ' and Romney says , Oh , right . Can you cook dinner for the guys when they ' re done ? ' Of course Shelley gets up and walks out . The next day bin Laden gets killed . Shelley calls me . Oh my God , " ' she says , was that you guys did that ? ' So I , well , let ' s just say I ' ve been getting free donuts the past year . "
