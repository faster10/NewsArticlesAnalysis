Triage nurse Sam Mandel describes Mrs Whitaker ' s presentation . " She was crying at the triage desk saying her seizures were completely out of control . Every minute or so she would stop talking and would start throwing her arms in the air and looking at the ceiling . Seriously , she looked like Gumby trying to catch a football . And I ' m sitting there thinking how I ' m only 30 minutes into this shift and already complete crap is coming in through the door . Damn . " Shaking his head in disbelief he went on , " The only reason I took her directly back to a resus bed is because I couldn ' t hear my iPad movie over her incessant fake seizure yell grunts in the triage area .
