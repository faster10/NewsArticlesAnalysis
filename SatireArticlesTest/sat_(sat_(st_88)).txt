" We saw this hairy creature in the water , and we wondered if it was a bear " says Timothy Sanders , one of the hunters implicated in the accident . " But after watching it for a minute or two , we were all convinced that it was actually a sasquatch . It was an extremely hairy humanoid and it seemed to be more intelligent than a bear . It kept moving around clumsily and appeared to be bipedal . We figured that we had to shoot it to prove to everyone that the Bigfoot actually existed . "
