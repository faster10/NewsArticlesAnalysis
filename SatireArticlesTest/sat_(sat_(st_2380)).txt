" The president told Pope Francis that while he ' d like to validate his parking , " one Obama aide told reporters , " the mall the parking garage is attached to has very strict rules about who can validate parking , and unfortunately the White House is not on their list of approved vendors . " The Pope then asked why President Obama doesn ' t have the authority to override the rules of the parking garage , and Obama told him that he " just didn ' t have that kind of authority under our Constitution , " according to the same staffer .
