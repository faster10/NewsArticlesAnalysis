" If Governor Scott happens to be in the state at the time it ' s passed and he ' s not out fundraising for his presidential campaign as all great governors who are focused on the issues related to their current job title do he ' ll most definitely sign the bill into law , " said Ronald Torkelson , a representative in Walker ' s office . " We can ' t have these poors thinking they are entitled to the pursuit of happiness , on top of their right to life and liberty , can we , " Torkelson asked rhetorically .
