" I had never dared to venture from the front screen with the buttons . Usually I just show up cursing under my breath , push the SILENCE button , shake the patient , and tell him to stop bending his arm . You know how it usually goes . It ' s bothering everyone else , especially his roommate , and besides his line is going to clot off and then I ' ll have to summon the energy to place another IV . But this time was different , there my patient was , snoring away , ' PATIENT SIDE OCCLUDED ' blinking away on the pump screen , the usual shrill banshee beep of the alarm . His sleep deprived roommate throwing balled up slipper socks in an attempt to sink one into the snorer ' s open mouth , and as I picked his roommate ' s sockballs off the floor , I looked at the pump ' s back , and there it was !
