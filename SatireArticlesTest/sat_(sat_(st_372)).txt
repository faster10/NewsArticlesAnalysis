" When my husband Tim comes home every night , it ' s never ' Hi , honey , I had a great day at work today , ' " said Vanessa Hutton . " No , it ' s ' Guess what that prick Lighter said today in the lunchroom God , I hate him . ' I ' m very concerned for my husband ' s well being , because if this goes on for much longer , he will either develop an ulcer , or he ' ll quit his job just to get away from Lighter . It ' s conditions like this that should remind everyone of the importance of legalizing unions . "
