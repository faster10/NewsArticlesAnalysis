US Marine Lt . General James Mattis caused some controversy when he told an Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association panel discussion that , " it ' s fun to shoot some people . " Marine Corps Commandant General Mike Hagee , reacting to Lt . General Mattis ' s comments said , " ( Mattis ) often speaks with a great deal of candor . I ' ve advised him not to be so honest when he ' s talking to the press , the stupid idiot . Sure , killing guys can be a hoot I mean , think about what you ' d like to have done with that asshole that cut you off on the highway on your way to work this morning . But still , we sort of like to keep that stuff under wraps . It ' s a little freaky for the wives and mothers . you know ? "
