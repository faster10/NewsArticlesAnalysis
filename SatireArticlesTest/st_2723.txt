Asked for comment , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was " adamantly against " Trump shooting any Americans just to make a point . " Then again , " McConnell said after thinking a moment , " we Republicans have to ask are immigrants really Americans ? Do Muslim Americans really count as much as Christian Americans do ? All of these things we ' ll have to sort out through the first 100 days of Emperor Trump ' s reign , and if a few Mexicans or Muslims have to be shot to hammer out all the fine print , isn ' t that worth it in the end ? "
