Every day we hear climate change is going to be disastrous : more wars , more famine , more flooding . Right now , it ' s not global warming that ' s killing me , it ' s the suspense that ' s killing me . I mean , yes , millions are going to die , and that ' s bad , but do you know what ' s just as bad ? The terrible psychological burden we live with , every day , of knowing that millions of us are going to die . Who needs that ? Really , if scientists genuinely cared about us , they wouldn ' t constantly berate us for not doing anything about climate change , they would figure out a way to speed up the whole process to put us out of our misery . Like pulling the plug .
