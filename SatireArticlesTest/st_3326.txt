Still , no one today believes that World War II was a bad war it needed to be fought . Which leads me to Afghanistan . Due to the later antics of the Bush Cheney administration , the reasons we ' re in Afghanistan have grown hazy . If not for Iraq , we probably wouldn ' t still even need to be in Afghanistan . But in 2001 , the Taliban who controlled that country harbored the man who was the spiritual leader of a small group of fanatics who attacked the United States and wouldn ' t give him up . You could say on our part it was a war of vengeance ( yet another reason ) , but since Osama bin Laden was promising more attacks , you can also regard it as a defensive war . And at one point we actually had won that war the Taliban were routed , the Afghanis were for the most part happy to see us and the future looked bright . In a way , it was too easy it just wasn ' t enough war for Bush and he was on a roll , determined to change the balance of power in the whole region . And boy , did he ever .
