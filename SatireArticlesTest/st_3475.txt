Aw , geez . The one place a husband shouldn ' t be on a Sunday afternoon is at the supermarket with his wife . But I ' m up and I ' ve already used the ' I think I ' m coming down with consumption dear , ( cough cough ) excuse last week , so with slumped shoulders , shuffling gait and the same sort of put upon sigh I used to give my mom when she ' d drag me shopping back when I was ten , I get the car .
