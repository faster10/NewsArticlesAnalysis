" It is impossible to recreate a fully living dinosaur from these limited samples of DNA , but we have successfully introduced this DNA into living chicken skin cells , so the results of this embryo , if it comes to terms and eventually survives its own birth and does not present any biological defects , will be a total surprise . We have no idea what to expect at all , " explains the assistant research professor of molecular biology sciences . " We have noticed that the embryo grows at abnormal rates for a common chicken embryo . It is presently sixty five times bigger than the size of an average chicken embryo only after three days , but its growth seems exponential , which is clearly fascinating " he admits , visibly enthused by the discovery .
