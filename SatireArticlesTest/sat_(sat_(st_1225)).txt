CHICAGO , IL " I swore off horse races for 10 years , but I relapsed , " Sam Hemsworth told us from his wheelchair . " Before I knew it , I was in 40 , 000 deep with the mob again . The Don made it pretty clear that his guys were gonna shoot me in the kneecaps if I couldn ' t pay him back . He said , ' Your knees ain ' t gonna make it , ' so I thought it was pretty fair to assume that my knees weren ' t gonna make it . "
