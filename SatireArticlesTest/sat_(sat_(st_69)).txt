The Ethiopian Orthodox Church claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant in a chapel in the small town of Axum , in their country ' s northern Highlands . It arrived nearly 3 , 000 years ago , they say , and has been guarded by a succession of virgin monks who , once anointed , are forbidden to set foot outside the chapel grounds until they die . No one except the Guardians are ever allowed to see the Ark , not even the Patriarch of the Church .
