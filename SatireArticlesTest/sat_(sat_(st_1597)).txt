Perry says his new version will introduce an entirely new audience to the film , but knew his tampering with a cherished Hollywood classic would open him up to criticism . " This film influences a lot of the work I do today , " said Perry . " For people who say this version will not be accepted I say this : ten years ago no one thought we ' d have an African American family in the White House . If we can live in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue , then we can live in the Bailey House . " Oprah Winfrey added , " Growing up , my favorite book of all time was To Kill A Mockingbird , and my favorite movie was and still is It ' s A Wonderful Life . I feel honored to be a part of this timeless , universal , life affirming story . We ' re taking a look at Mockingbird for next year ! " she chirped .
