Now , I agree that NPR should ' ve fired Mr Williams since , as Daniel Schorr put it in his interview with Terry Gross ( have you ever noticed that when someone dies , Terry Gross can lean back and pull off the shelf a tape of an interview or two or three she ' s done with them like , twenty years ago ? Saves both time and money as well as showing why she ' s the greatest interviewer alive today that ' s a opinion , not an analysis by the way . ) Ah , shit . Where was I ? Oh , yeah ! Daniel Schorr , when speaking about finding out he was on the White House Enemies List , said he got angry . Not because he was targeted by Nixon , but because he had inadvertently " become the story " , something a true reporter ( or analyst ) should never do .
