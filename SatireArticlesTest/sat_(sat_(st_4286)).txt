Look , Mr Williams was just perpetrating a stereo type . He ' s smart enough to know that too . He was playing to that dope Bill O ' Reilly , plain and simple and it cost him a job at NPR and got him two million bucks from FOX . He ' s got nothing to complain about . Which is why if I was in an airport and saw him , I ' d be nervous stupid , racist and bigoted people , no matter what color they are , make me nervous and Juan Williams now falls squarely into that category . The dope .
