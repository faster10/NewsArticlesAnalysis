When asked if those events themselves would also require documentation , the dean said , " Clearly all health events require documentation . We have been meeting with CMS to determine where the responsibility for documenting lack of documented health events will lie . For now it is unclear if we have the resources to handle this important job , which is why we are advocating creating a fellowship in this field . We obviously need more dedicated research into this crucial area of patient care . We need to train researchers to perform metric analyses to identify correlations between patient outcomes and coding patterns amongst healthcare providers utilizing integrated versus non integrated EHR ' s in acute , sub acute and non acute settings both rural and urban . We are behind the curve on this . "
