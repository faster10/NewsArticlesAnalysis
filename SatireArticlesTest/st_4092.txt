Nevertheless , fellow conscience suppression researcher Dr Gregory Quirk of the Ponce School of Medicine , in Puerto Rico , is troubled by how his work might be used .

With that same method , he says , firemen could stave off episodes of life threatening panic . " Certainly the military might be interested in something like that , " he says . " If this would be used to go against moral conscience to kill people , I would have a problem with that . "
