In order to score some strong narcotics , you need to show up to the ED with a nice vague complaint , something like abdominal pain or nausea . This is acting , so you really have to commit to the role . BE DRAMATIC . Squirm , toss and turn , don ' t let any nurse or doctor or anything examine you , saying that you ' re going to die . When your vital signs , blood work , and imaging come up negative , don ' t ever ask for the drug Dilaudid directly . Always struggle to pronounce it . Or call it " that drug that begins with the letter D . " Works like a charm .
