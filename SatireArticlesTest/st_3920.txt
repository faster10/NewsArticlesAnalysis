I must say , I was shocked , shocked I tell you , at the allegations of the sexual abuse of children by Priests in Ireland , Germany , the United States , Fiji , Zambia , South Africa , Brazil , Chile , Mexico and , as it now appears to be , in far too many more countries to mention here so let ' s just say , all of them everywhere and that should cover it . The fact that while I was still a Bishop back in the good old Vaterland , allegations that I actually was both aware of this abuse and even helped cover it up have been even more shocking at least , the fact that I got caught doing it is . I was really counting on Divine Intervention to handle that .
