" Mr Hibben , " said psychologist and intra personal relationship expert Phillip R . Snavely , " should never have let on to the fact that he has read books neither having pictures nor penned by Dan Brown if he wanted to avoid contact with members of the lower regions of single society .

We can only hope that some day man will learn from his mistakes and center every conversation around the season finale of ' Lost ' or ' Scrubs ' , if not the weather . "
