" I myself am in the typewriter repair business , and I can think back to one day when some feller from some company called Mike grow soft , or something like that selling pillows I figure started telling me that computers were the wave of the future . I told him to kindly get out of my store and never come back . ' I sell typewriters fer a living , ' I I told him , ' on account of that ' s what I ' ve always done , and why change when you ' ve got a good thing going ? ' "
