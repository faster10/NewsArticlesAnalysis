At a news conference at Chicago ' s Center for Green Technology , Gore stated , " The people have spoken , and we ' re here to say ' we hear you ' . Despite the best efforts of our scientists to predict what the effects of increased levels of CO2 in the atmosphere , deforestation and pollution would have on the environment , no one could have seen the winter of 2008 coming . So to everyone who has to bundle up on Cubs opening day , and generally put up with this nasty weather despite my assurances that the Earth ' s climate would increase five degrees by 2010 , I say to you : I ' m sorry you were right to complain about me being alarmist . "
