Like many of my chiropractic colleagues , I am doubtful that so called " infectious diseases are solely caused by microorganisms or germs . Based on much of the chiropractic literature , it is more likely that skeletal alignment is the sole cause of many of the diseases we consider infectious . It is no coincidence that most chiropractic schools do not even teach germ theory in their classrooms . In fact , I suspect with more chiropractic training in countries like Liberia , the spread of the disease would no longer be an issue .
