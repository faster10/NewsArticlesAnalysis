( On Abortion " Is it is it that litmus test that is the be all , end all for for some women ? I don ' t know . But my my position on abortion is here again , knowing that there is common ground here with those of us who are pro life and want to see fewer and fewer abortions in this world , and those who support abortion rights . They , too , the ones whom I have spoken with and there are those in my own family that don ' t agree with all my pro life positions that I ' ve taken . But the common ground that we have is they , too , would like to see fewer abortions and preventative measures be available and being you know , that we wouldn ' t shy away from those things . So again , the end result would be fewer abortions . So I don ' t know if that ' s the be all , end all issue there . If it is , it ' s kind of unfortunate because I think we could and should all be working together to meet the challenges that our families , our communities , our nation face . "
