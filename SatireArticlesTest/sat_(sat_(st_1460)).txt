Some nurses are taking a very different approach . Emily Richard , an ER nurse , loves the new idea and is using the reflective belts for another reason . " Yeah , so when I don ' t want anybody to talk to me or to tell me what to do , I just wear the belt around the ED all shift . Works like a charm ! " If someone asks her for help with a lab draw or a new IV bag , she just motions towards her safety belt and puts her hands in the air just like she doesn ' t care .
