A group of about 25 urban youths male and female showed up en masse in Mentor , some demanding that store owners pay them for performing outside of their establishments . " I had some mad Christmas hooks ready to lay down , " said Chris T , a self described Christian rapper . " Then we get here and people started running away , like we was trying to start trouble . One lady tripped and fell down and her glasses broke . I tried to hand them back and she screamed . Another man hurt his leg running away so fast . "
