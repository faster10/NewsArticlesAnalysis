By the fourth century A . D . , the tomb ' s location was no longer known , if one can trust the accounts of several of the early Church Fathers . However , creditable Arab commentators , including Ibn Abd al Hakam ( A . D . 871 ) , Al Massoudi ( A . D . 944 ) , and Leo the African ( sixteenth century A . D . ) all report having seen the tomb of Alexander , but none of them specified its exact location .
