" I am humbled , at a loss for words , to express how thankful I am to have such kind friends in my sponsors , Donna and Bob Nickerson . They feel like my colleagues as much as my board of directors . Through people like them , and Save the Dot Coms , I have been able to blow our marketing budget without increasing our debt burden . We are still cash flow negative , but at least we have the chance to make it through the winter ! Thanks Donna and Bob ! "
