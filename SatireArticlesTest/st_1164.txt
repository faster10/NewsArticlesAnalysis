" Wow , I really disagree with my first note , " blurted a disgusted Kellerman . " Wrong , wrong , just all wrong ! Why did I order kayexalate for hypokalemia ? And why did I order a rectal IV ? I ' m such a moron sometimes . Good thing I wrote this second note . " He takes a few moments to write an addendum to his second note . He reads it out loud : " I saw and examined the patient and disagree with the findings and plan of care I documented in my first note . Hence why this note . It ' s a much better note , I promise . You ' ll like this note . "
