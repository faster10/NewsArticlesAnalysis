Prior to launching its Premium Quote Service on Nov . 8 , financial site Raging Bull offered free stock quotes to registered users . Those same quotes are still available for free , said general manager Jeffrey Housenbold . However , users who want new quotes , those dated after Nov . 8 , can do so through the Premium Quote Service , at 2 . 95 per quote . " The derivation of ' free ' can also be traced to the Sanskrit word for dear , while the Latin word praemium could also be defined as ' reward , ' " noted Housenbold . " I feel confident our members will appreciate the difference . "
