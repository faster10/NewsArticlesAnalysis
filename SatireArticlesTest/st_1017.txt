" Today , prescriptions are legible because they ' re printed by computers in easy to read fonts , " explained pharmacist Dominick Lowell . " BORING ! I miss deciphering a doctor ' s horrific handwriting . The thrill of wondering . Does it say insulin or penicillin ? Does it say 0 . 25 or 250 mg ? What ' s this doctor ' s name ? Is it a he or she ? This can ' t possibly be the DEA number , can it ? There ' s no confusion now . Insulin clearly reads insulin . Doses are crisp . It ' s so predictable and , frankly , boring . "
