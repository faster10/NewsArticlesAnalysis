" I walked into the store the other day , " said organizer Libral , and I swear I saw a box of gluten free rice krispies . It ' s a sad day in America when Snap , Crackle and Pop are turned into politically correct food puppets . It ' s like they took my childhood , chewed it up and spat it right in my face my face ! " As if on cue , one unidentified shopper then spat in Libral ' s face . " Hmmm , gluten free raisin bread , " said Libral , wiping the spelt laced spittle from his lips . " DON ' T GO AGAINST THE GRAIN ! " he screamed at the counter demonstrator , who laughed and gave him the finger .
