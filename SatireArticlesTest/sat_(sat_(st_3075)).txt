Traditionally , the Arab zeitgeist had been all about restrictive . That changed with Arab Spring . Suddenly it all went from tighty noosey to loosey goosey , very throw off the shackles they don ' t match my oeuvre ' . You even had these disparate groups uniting . It was tres young , multi cultural . But , honey , now I think the grown up look will return . More serious . If the Arab Spring was ' Benetton . ' Arab Summer will be more ' Ann Taylor . ' I know that seems a step backward . Or four . But personally it ' ll have me singing Ave Sharia !
