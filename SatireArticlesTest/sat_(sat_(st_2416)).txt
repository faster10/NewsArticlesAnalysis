It was apparent that AC DC ' s rock was never gonna die . The album , very appropriately named Back in Black , became a worldwide smash and AC DC exploded all over the charts hitting the radar of parental resource groups right in the face . AC DC became a number one offender in the eyes of decent folk throughout the world . Families were warned to appeal for the banishment of that album from the radio and record stores , but church groups were unable to stem the tide of the AC DC landslide .
