Two wide dark men in flannel shirts with dirty baseball hats on their heads sat silently at the bar counter reading Mexican newspapers and drinking unknown Mexican beer in green bottles . An anonymous muted soccer match was playing on a large television mounted on the wall of the main dining area . Loud horny mariachi music was funneled through the establishment ' s public address . Almost every table and booth of the place had patrons , mostly of Latino descent and over half with crying babies . The tables were unattended to and strewn with various half eaten entrees , as well as dirty silverware , plates , and burning cigars .
