First of all , this is about what the conservative pundits are calling the " Ground Zero Mosque " , although it ' s not at Ground Zero . Second of all , I ' m not a New Yorker I ' m an ex New Yorker . I haven ' t lived in Manhattan since 1989 and the last time I worked there was like , 1998 or something and I ' ve only been back once since 9 11 . But since people who ' ve never come within a thousand miles of the City seem to have no problem weighing in on what should be a local problem , then I guess I have a right to as well . And that opinion is : everybody , both pro mosque and anti mosque , are completely wrong and mostly a bunch of idiots .
