" A whole bunch of guys came in wearing these green jackets , " explained waitress Milly Pope of Jan ' s Diner in nearby Edgefield . " I figured they had to be from the real estate convention across town . I know the drill . Back in the ' 70s all I got out of convention week was tired feet and some pinch marks on my rear . These days I ' m lucky if I get a decent tip and a thank you when that bunch rolls in . "
