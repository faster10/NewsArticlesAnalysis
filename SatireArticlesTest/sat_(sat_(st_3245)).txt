I just don ' t feel like I ' m part of this thing , you know ? I know we ' re technically with you , since we signed a blood pact ( Denise ' s diabetes finger prick thing didn ' t draw nearly enough blood , by the way ) , but I just don ' t feel controlled by you in any meaningful way . It ' s kind of a no pressure thing , and , hey , no offence , if I ' m going to be part of a harem , I ' m going to need something more emotionally damaging .
