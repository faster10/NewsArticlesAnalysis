Pressure on the Bush Administration to set a timetable for the military to withdraw from Iraq is growing , with North Carolina Congressman Walter Jones adding his voice to the call for withdrawal . Jones , whose district includes the military base of Camp Lejune and who coined the dopey phrase " Freedom Fries " , was a one time ardent supporter of beating the crap out of Iraq who has now proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that even obvious idiots are now having doubts about the war and it ' s aftermath . President Bush remains committed to the death and destruction however , proving that he ' s not an obvious idiot what exactly he is remains a mystery . Vice President Dick ( Dick ) Cheney responded to Mr Jones ' comments by saying that Howard Dean is over the top .
