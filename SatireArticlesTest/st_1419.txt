" You know I ' ve read the evidence and couldn ' t find much out there about the practice of bloodletting . I couldn ' t find a single article to say bloodletting is a detrimental treatment as my partners imply , " Lord Lockwell told reporters . " In fact , bloodletting is the ' gold standard ' for many diseases like hemochromatosis and polycythemia vera , to name a few . " Dr Lockwell went on to suggest perhaps these " treatments " could be expanded to other areas . " I just feel a good bloodletting is what my patients need . That ' s how I was trained and that is how I ' m going to practice . "
