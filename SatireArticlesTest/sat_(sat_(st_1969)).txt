" Not until every false prophet stops talking about it , " Jesus said , " that ' s when Dad and I will do it . Not a moment sooner . And even then , we still may not do it . I don ' t know , that Bible was written a long ass time ago , and you know how sometimes write an email to your co workers about how badly you want to quit your job , but then a couple days later you feel like you can hang around a little while longer ? That ' s how I feel about Revelation . That book was the product of my boredom I sent John of Patmos some really dark , dark imagery as inspiration , and truth to be told I was really kind of with him , and had I known that eons later some derpy douche like Bachmann would take it seriously , I never would have done that .
