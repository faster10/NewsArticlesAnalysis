Basically a sequel to the Clint Eastwood propaganda . It ' s post apocalypse and everything appears dead ( Thanks Obama ! ) Then out of the ashes a Chevrolet ( bailout money ) Silverado pickup emerges . Eventually several bailout pickup truck owners get together . One explains that a friend didn ' t make it ' cause he drove a Ford ( i . e . , he didn ' t take bailout money ) . Message : bailouts are good , capitalism is bad . Drive a Silveradobama ! ( NB : You ' ll notice at the end that the black bailout truck owner is holding the Twinkies . That means something . We ' ll get back to you . )
