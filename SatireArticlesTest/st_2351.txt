The Blue Ribbon for " Best in Show Marijuana Strain for this year went to Phunky Skunky . The unskilled botanist who created this strain ( Scottie L . ) compares his work to the masters of their time , from Monet to Michaelangelo . While I wouldn ' t go so far as to rank Scottie with artistic geniuses since he ' s a dropout , I will give him credit for convincing over 60 of the fair voters that his marijuana strain is " more outrageously awesome " than the others . With stiff competition from other strains , Scottie L . holds himself head and shoulders above the crowd . His head shop in Denver should have brisk business for the next year or so while the Phish hippies get word out and rush to his shop to have their minds blown .
