Three thirty in the morning again it ' s officially a pattern . I ' ve been waking up early every few days for a month now . At least back in my Manhattan days , I could just get dressed , go out and catch a cab someplace at three AM . Of course , in Manhattan , I would ' ve never been asleep yet at this hour . These were the Irving Plaza days of the 1980 ' s . I ' d be working right now .
