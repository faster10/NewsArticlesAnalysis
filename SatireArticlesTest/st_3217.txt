And by that I mean real stars , not " celebrities . " Although that does bring up another complaint : that I ' m playing favorites with celebrities , giving them physical advantages . Nonsense . First off , I don ' t choose what makes them celebrities . You do . Great job with that , by the way . Secondly , Katy wasn ' t a celebrity when I decided to answer her prayer . She was 11 . Lastly , and most importantly , I may be a lot of things OK , technically everything ' but I am not unfair . Never doubt that everything is in balance . Never doubt that whenever I open a window , somewhere I close a door . Katy ' s a perfect example . Yes , I answered her prayer , but do you know who I have her dating ? John Mayer . That ' s right . She ' s got big breasts , but she ' s in love with an asshole . So quit griping .
