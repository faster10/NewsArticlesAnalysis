But I know three things if we were really committed to it , we could do it , and if we did it , it would be a good thing and third innocent people will die in the process , because innocent people always die in the process . Innocent people will die if we walk away too , possibly a whole lot more . The Iraqi debacle made Iran far stronger than it ever would have been leaving Afghanistan will make them ( and our ally of convenience , Pakistan ) stronger still . Soon there will be two nuclear armed countries in the region and within a decade there ' ll be a far larger , far more devastating war . And once again , millions , not hundreds or even tens of thousands , of innocent civilians will die .
