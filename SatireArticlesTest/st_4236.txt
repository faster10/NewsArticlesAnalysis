" Look uh , Judy , I really hate to bother the doctor with illness and all , but this sore throat has gotten out of hand . Is there a way I can see the doctor before my scheduled appointment ? " " No he ' s booked solid , but I can give you a slot with his PA . She ' s the one who sees people who are actually sick anyway . The Doctor is there more for the long term stuff and to write out referrals to other doctors . " " Referrals ? " " Of course . Your health insurance company won ' t let you see a specialist without a referral from your GP first . " " So , if I had , say , a severe massive brain swelling " " Oh , then I ' d get you right in to the PA , who ' d get you an emergency slot with the doctor within days , who ' d refer you to a specialist , who ' d send you to the hospital . Takes a little less than a week or two , at the most . " " Wow , that ' s fast . " I marveled . " Yes , " he answered proudly , " The United States healthcare system is the best in the world that ' s why we can ' t let you take advantage of it easily . " " I can see that now . So about my sore throat " " You can come in today at 1 : 45 to see the PA . She ' s got a five minute opening then . "
