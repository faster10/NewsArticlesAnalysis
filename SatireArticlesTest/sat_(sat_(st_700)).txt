" I lost my job , the bank foreclosed on my house , and I still had two kids to support , " said local resident Sheila Warren . " I knew something was weird , though , when my son suddenly became my father , and I suggested that instead of driving over to my sister Christie ' s house that we flap our arms and fly there instead so pick up my long dead mother on the way . It was about then that I realized that I had to be dreaming , and that by waking up I ' d have everything back . What a relief . "
