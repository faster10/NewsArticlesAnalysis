The " vanity " items won ' t create gameplay imbalances , either , Forsythe claims . " Our vanity items are high powered , but expensive . For instance , if you want to play as an almost invincible Jedi knight , you can , but it ' ll cost you 99 for a three month subscription to that package . Access to large vehicles , like AT AT walkers and controlling imperial battleships , will cost 49 for three months . We think this is reasonable and fair , because only a select few players will pay that amount each quarter , so it won ' t ruin the balance of matches . "
