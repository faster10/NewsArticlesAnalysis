PhRMA claims its advances into the shadowy field of memory and remorse are not intended to produce morally anesthetized grunts and political hacks . " We ' re trying to fend off post traumatic stress so that women who ' ve been raped can leave their houses without feeling like targets . So that survivors of terrorist attacks can function , raise families , and move forward . So that young soldiers aren ' t left shattered for decades by images of dead children and the screams of tortured prisoners . And yes , so that those influence peddlers we send to fight for us in Washington are not paralyzed with shame by what they ' ve seen and done in public service . " said Tauzin ' s press secretary . PhRMA nevertheless voluntarily canceled its Washington laboratory license , citing " adverse financial circumstances . "
