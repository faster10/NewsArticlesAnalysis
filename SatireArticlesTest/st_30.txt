" I know that I will shock many people by saying this , but I think that women can indeed be admitted into Heaven . , " the Imam preached . " The Prophet said No woman should travel except with a Mahram ' . Ascending to heaven is the greatest trip in every good muslim ' s existence . I don ' t believe that the Prophet meant this trip to be an exception . I think that a woman can get into Heaven , as long as she ' s accompanied by a man of her family . This , of course , implies that at least one man in her family needs to be admitted himself "
