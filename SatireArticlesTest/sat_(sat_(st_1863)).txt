SKOKIE , ILLINOIS Officer Dustin Grayson is an exemplary policeman . In his 12 year career , Grayson has garnered several awards from the police union in his Illinois town . Asking any of his co workers about him will get you a glowing review of his work . Grayson , in fact , is such a good cop that he recently told our reporters he had " had enough " of the spat of police officers killing suspects , often times young black man , often times unarmed , instead of bringing them in alive and under arrest as he says , " the Constitution tells you to do , " and he says that if he witnesses 15 unlawful killings , he ' ll " definitely speak up " about it .
