" It ' s like when I used to die my hair pink and dress in torn , stone washed jeans and Vince Neil t shirts I ' d never go back and put on that stuff again , just like I wouldn ' t seriously endorse the slaughter of innocent Jews , or suggest that they are responsible for all of the world ' s wars and problems , " said Stone . " But even though you might look back on the past and wish that you ' d had a little better taste than to wear a hot pink ruffled blouse , or to commit genocide , when local 80 ' s cover band Headbanger ' s Ball plays on Fridays , it ' s impossible not to get a little sentimental and rock out ! It ' s all just for fun ! "
