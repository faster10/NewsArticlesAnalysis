Earlier today I had the privilege of speaking with a group of constituents , our newest and largest growing GOP demographic , the conservative Afro American voting block . Unfortunately , some remarks made inadvertently referenced a dark period in our American history , when descendants of the very people I met with today did not and could not enjoy the freedoms that we all take for granted . No offense was intended , and I look forward to meeting with more of our constituents during our statewide meet and greets ! God bless America .
