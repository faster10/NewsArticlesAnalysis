According to White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan , " Once the None from Column A edict goes into effect , any restaurant owner or employer caught preparing or serving General Tso ' s ( or General Tsao ' s ) chicken or any other Asian chicken related dish can be imprisoned indefinitely at a secret location without legal representation , proper food , adequate shelter , or toilet paper for as long as the president shall deem fit . These measures , however , do not apply to Korean restaurants . "
