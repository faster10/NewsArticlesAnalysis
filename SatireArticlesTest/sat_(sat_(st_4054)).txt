Here ' s an amazing fact did you know that for the last eight or so years , from just around the 2000 elections till right now , stuff has been happening all over the world that has absolutely nothing to do with George W . Bush ? I know , I know , that ' s what I thought too , but it ' s true . Now that the election ' s over and having nothing else to do , I ' ve been checking . I was amazed at all the stuff I found that had nothing at all to do with either America or the Bush Administration . I mean , yeah , I knew about that tsunami thing a few years back and I heard about Steve Irwin , but there ' s tons of other stuff that happened too .
