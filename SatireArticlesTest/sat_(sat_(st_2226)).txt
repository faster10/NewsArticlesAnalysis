If implemented , these sugar regulations would impact numerous facets of daily life for practically every American citizen . A can of Coca Cola has 39g of sugars . A Snickers bar ? 27g . But what about less obvious products ? DiGiorno pizzas contain roughly 6g of sugar they ' d need to decrease their sugar count by 1g per serving , or wear a warning label on their box . Nyquil cough syrup has 13g of sugars per serving , so not only would they need the warning label , but they ' d also need to use a " candy " label as well , on a medicinal product .
