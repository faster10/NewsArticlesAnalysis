Dad , I know you never liked me listening to Karl and Dick all the time . I know you thought invading Saddam Hussein was a bad idea , but Don Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz were really sure we could do it pretty easy . It was their fault , I admit it . But Dick really thought it was a good idea too , and he worked for you when you were President too , so it ' s kinda your fault too , even though you told me not to do it . But I did use up a lot of military stuff and a lot of your friends made a lot of money replacing it , so there ' s that .
