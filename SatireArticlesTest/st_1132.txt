Just like it is absolutely critical to identify the vehicle against which a pedestrian on roller skates collides , it is also absolutely critical to identify traffic accident , nontraffic accident , or unspecified weather traffic or nontraffic accident . For example , V01 . 01XA stands for " pedestrian on roller skates injured in collision with pedal cycle in nontraffic accident , initial encounter , " V01 . 11XA stands for " pedestrian on roller skates injured in collision with pedal cycle in traffic accident , initial encounter , " and V01 . 91XA stands for " pedestrian on roller skates injured in collision with pedal cycle , unspecified whether traffic or nontraffic accident , initial encounter . " Understanding these differences is crucial for the management of traumatic injuries .
