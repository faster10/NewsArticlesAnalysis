Being dead , Saint Paris ( See , I ' m already thinking positive . ) needs to have what ' s called a " nihil obstat " granted by the Vatican . It ' s a Latin phrase that translated means " nothing hinders . " Basically , it states that a bishop or higher church official has reviewed the saint ' s case and given that all important Community Chest card of " Advance to go and collect 200 . " I wrote the Vatican on this one . Fingers crossed .
