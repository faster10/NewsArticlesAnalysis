About a year ago the rich guys finally sobered up enough to realize they ' d made a really bad deal and stopped giving away any more booze to poor people who couldn ' t afford to pay for it . And when all their rich cousins sobered up too , they started asking each other for their liquor back , but in their alcoholic haze , no one knew exactly who had what or how many empty bottles they were responsible for that had rolled under the bed or into the bushes or got smashed against the wall . It was , in short , a helluva of party .
