At a press conference upon his return to his mountain cabin , Gowdy hosted a conference call and told reporters about his fishing excursion . " Well , I spent about 11 hours out there , " Gowdy told the press , " and I used every form of bait I could think of . Literally there is no other way I could have tried to get the result I wanted , and at the end of it all I came back to this cabin and didn ' t have a single , solitary fish to speak of . I did however , formulate several conspiracy theories as to why the fish weren ' t biting , and so I plan to keep coming back here and fishing the same waters over and over until I do get the results I want .
