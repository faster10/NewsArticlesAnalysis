Mr Ryan further wrote that he would " be once again voting for whoever the Libertarian Party nominates " because at least he can " trust that the LP will put up someone no one but libertarians will vote for because they understand that winning elections might sound like the best way to direct your government , but is actually only the theories of statist libtards and the like . " According to Ryan , even though Senator Rand Paul never even got above 10 in the polls , he should " clearly " be the nominee .
