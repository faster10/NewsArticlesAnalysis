Inmates on death row will go under general anesthesia with high doses of propofol before they are executed . Currently , as the law stands , the only way for the execution to go forward is for the inmate to refuse their " last meal . " There is no such thing as an emergent execution and according to the American Society of Anesthesia ( ASA ) , you must wait 8 hours before general anesthesia . Therefore an inmate may grow old on death row eating only their favorite foods .
