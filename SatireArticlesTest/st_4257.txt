First and foremost The Syracuse DPW ( Department of Public Works ) guys , despite how much we like to rag on them , do a hard job very well . Every week they pick up your trash and recycling , whether it ' s festering and maggot infested in the Summer or frozen under piles of dirty snow in the Winter . Their job is hard and disgusting , but if you ' re out when they ' re on your street and say hello and thank you , they ' re also a surprisingly good bunch of guys . So , make their job a little easier don ' t just pile rotting food into an overflowing open garbage can so that it spills out onto the street . Invest three freaking dollars in some trash bags . Don ' t overfill the bags either tie em closed and use two or three so the poor guys don ' t have to heave sixty pounds of trash into the truck at once .
