" Now a days I wake up every day feeling secure knowing that Iraq is being dealt with . Not like before 9 11 . I shutter at the thought of the days when Saddam was in power . I can ' t remember a tougher time for the United States . I can remember , as most American people can probably recall , of being very stressed and afraid of Saddam and Iraq before 9 11 . Everyday I would wake up and worry , what is Saddam going to do to the United States today ? Why aren ' t we dealing with that country ? "
