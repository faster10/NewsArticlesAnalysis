Goodness is a quality we should all strive for , regardless of reward , but I ' ve come to notice , especially over the last fifty or sixty years , or essentially from the beginning of the Baby Boom , that most children ( and adults too for that matter ) were only being good in the hopes of some sort of pay out by myself , their parents or relatives . This is directly contrary to the aforementioned principle of being " good for goodness sake " , but I could have still been comfortable with that after all , goodness is the primary aim here . But recently , even so simple a matter as being ' good ' has become skewed beyond the scale of any moral compass , with the possible exception of George W . Bush ' s .
