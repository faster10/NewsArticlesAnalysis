Starbucks is very pleased with the outcome . Spokesman Thomas Kinkade , who resides over Asia and the Middle East market said , " Before , we could only service half of the population . Now we can service the whole population and women tend to like more expensive , crazier drink options that will bring in much more revenue than a guy buying a grande coffee in the morning . Selling a seven dollar double shot frappuccino with whipped cream and caramel is better than a dollar of burnt coffee . "
