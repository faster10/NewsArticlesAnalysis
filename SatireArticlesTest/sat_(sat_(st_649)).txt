" Sometimes I think I ' m subconsciously trying to get caught , " continued the addled Stewart . " You get to a point where you just don ' t care , and the decision to keep on going , living in the same destructive routine as the day before , is far more painful than the thought of seeing it all end with that 100 ticket and a few points on the license . Sometimes , I think the cops are just watching me suffer , like the time when I blew through the orange light right in front of City Hall . That was definitely some kind of Dostoevskian attempt at a confession on my part , but nothing happened and I continue to live this miserable life the only way I ' ve ever known it on the lam . "
