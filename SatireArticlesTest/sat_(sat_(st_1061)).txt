Allow me to share an anecdote which will conclusively demonstrate why this patient would be better served by your kind of doctors . Once , I had a patient similar to this one , who was mistakenly admitted to my service . Although I provided excellent care for his chief complaint , I am sorry to say that his other medical problems did not receive ideal management , and one of them worsened to the point that your team was consulted to treat it . A narrow miss , I ' d say ! Clearly patients of this variety are better served by doctors of the type that you are .
