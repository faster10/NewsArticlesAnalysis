It ' s not like we can just turn this poor kid away at the door , " says Jason Baxter . " We ' ll take him into our home and treat him like a proper guest , and raise him like we would our own . But we ' re going to fight this , too . Just because we ' re well off and raise good kids doesn ' t mean we should have other peoples ' kids forced on us . If this is Obama ' s America , I want know part of it . "
