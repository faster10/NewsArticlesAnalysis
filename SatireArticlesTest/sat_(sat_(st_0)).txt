Punishments for disobedience will vary from case to case , depending on their severity . First time offenders will be subject to " public embarrassment penalties , including wearing signage that reads " I ' m a masturbator . " If found guilty of a second charge , the violator will have to wear a " penial cage or " chastity tube , " which physically inhibits the wearer from achieving a full erection without discomfort . The duration of the punishment will be decided by the presiding judge in the case . Repeat offenders will have their chastity sentences extended in combination with mandatory community service at local daycares to " learn the rewarding gift of parenthood . "
