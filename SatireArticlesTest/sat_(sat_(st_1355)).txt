" This is the real kicker , right here . My patient develops a subdural , so , of course , I read an UpToDate article and discover he might need surgery . I ' ve been caring for this guy for a week on the floors , so I ' m ready . I ask my senior to cover my patients while I go perform the surgery , and she looks at me like I ' m an idiot . It turns out , we don ' t do brain surgery in this medicine residency . The neurosurgeons do . This program sucks ! I wanted to be like the docs on House ! Those guys do everything . "
