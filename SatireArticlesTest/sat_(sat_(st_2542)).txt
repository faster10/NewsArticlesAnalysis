Perhaps DC is attempting to keep up with their competitor , Marvel , who recently announced plans to drastically overhaul two of their top shelf heroes . Thor , the once mighty Norse God , is now a golden haired , big breasted woman in a feminized version of the deity ' s costume . Even more shocking to the comic book community is Captain America ' s new appearance , as that of a jive talking African American . Marvel hopes to reach a wider , more diverse audience by promoting gender and racial equality within their character roster .
