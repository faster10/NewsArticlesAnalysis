Dr Lin continued , " The workup I outlined above is a pretty standard ED approach . What makes me different is the collaborative , interdepartmental nature of the care of my patients . We , in the ED , are always telling ourselves how great it would be if we got a little more time 30 min to prepare for that multi car MVA or gangland shooting spree instead of 30 seconds . I feel it ' s empathic 21st century medicine to extend the same courtesy to my colleagues . "
