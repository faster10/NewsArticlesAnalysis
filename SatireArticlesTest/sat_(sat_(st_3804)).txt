" We MUST make sure that Iraq does not try to disrupt our way of life again . The Iraqi people have tried to take away our freedoms and attack our country for far to long . After 9 11 , it wasn ' t clear to me why we should take action against Iraq . I was very naive then . Now it is obvious to me . How could we not attack Iraq ? How could we just sit and wait for Iraq to attack us again ? "
