Change takes time and the support of regular people , not just the really rich ones who try to buy elections in order to keep their tax breaks or shadowy foreign corporations pouring money into our elections . Change doesn ' t mean just voting " No " . It means discussion , deals and bi partisanship . It means frustrating compromise and going back and trying again and again . Rosa Parks didn ' t get off the bus and have all White people say , " Well , okay . That ' s done . Let ' s segregate . "
