" The outpouring of support for our candidate ' s forceful stretching of truth to the point of it being unrecognizable while in pursuit of an idealistic crusade to rob women of their sexual choices is just heart warming for us all , " Williamson said , adding that " Carly just cannot wait for the next debate " because she plans to " tell the world about a scene she saw in the latest sting video that showed President Obama himself wearing a t shirt that said ' I hate babies ' on it while he performed over 200 abortions at once , with the help of Hillary Clinton and Saul Alinsky ' s ghost .
