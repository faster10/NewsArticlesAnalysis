So now it ' s this Spring and Summer . Over the past year or so , most of the little guys have sobered up and are trying to get through their fiscal hangovers . The rich guys , having had more booze than us in the wine cellar , took a little longer and are in that morning after , bleary eyed and jittery stage , trying to remember just what happened . They ' re at the point where they ' re staring at numbers scribbled on cocktail napkins and wondering if their wives are going to pick up the phone when some chick named Bunny calls or why they have a note that says , ' That biker guy , Snake , the one you got thrown out of the bar , says he ' s coming to your house tomorrow and beat the snot out of you ' . In short , they ' re laying low and hiding out . Suddenly even sober and responsible people can ' t borrow money and the Stock Markets are crashing .
