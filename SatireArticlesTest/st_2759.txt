" What kind of capitalist economy can withstand such a brutal , socialist assault as to see all these hundreds of thousands of new jobs , created over multiple years now , " Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( R WI ) asked rhetorically at an early morning press conference . Ryan said that " seeing Socialism brutalize our economy by adding a ton of jobs and keeping the unemployment rate steady at 5 " is tantamount to " King George riding in on a horse and forcing us to swear fealty to Communist Russia , and everyone can see that . " He further intimated that he ' d look to impeach Obama " should his lawless communism continue to result in thousands of Americans finding work . "
