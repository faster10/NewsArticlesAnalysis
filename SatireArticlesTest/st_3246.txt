Ignorant and sometimes hateful comments regarding my activities , which are frankly none of your business , have resulted in me having to end many friendships ( some by running those people down with my car ) , but I have emerged stronger and more determined to hit people with my car than ever . At the end of the day , this is about respect , and if I can ' t have your respect , then I don ' t want you around . I want you rolling limply to a stop in a contorted mess on the shoulder of the freeway , as I keep driving .
