I didn ' t care much about Ronald Reagan back then . You see , he hadn ' t achieved sainthood in the Church of The Tea Bags back then . You have to remember the context of the times back in 1981 the final American withdrawal from Vietnam was just one month shy of six years before , the Iranian Hostage Crisis had ended , after Reagan ( allegedly ) paid the revolutionaries there 40 million dollars to hold the hostages until he took office just seventy days earlier and of course Watergate and Nixon ' s resignation was only seven years before . Hell , even Gerald Ford had first been shot at by a girl named Squeaky then an accountant not too many ago as well . And all this came on the heels of JFK , Dr King , riots , and Bobby Kennedy , riots . It was a bit of a bad patch for America
