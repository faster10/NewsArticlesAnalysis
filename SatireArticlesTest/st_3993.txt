( On John McCain ) " I have nothing to complain about . There were very good people involved in all of this , and very experienced and very sharp . I would have preferred more opportunity to speak to the media more often , because there were a lot of things that I think it could have , should have said that could have , would have helped John McCain . I have such great admiration for him . I honor him . I love him . I believe that he is the best leader that we have in the nation right now , still , is John McCain . And I would have liked to have had more opportunity to be out there speaking on his behalf , of the attributes that that he has , because he ' s so humble he doesn ' t do that himself . He did not , I believe , have take enough opportunity , and that ' s just the way that he is , though . He ' s too humble . Take the opportunity to let people know the challenges that he has overcome , his ability to face adversity and overcome challenges . I would have liked more opportunity to have done that for him .
