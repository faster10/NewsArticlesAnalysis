" This University , and its proud history of moral direction , has suspended this organization , for exercising its constitutional rights . " The university went on to say , " Old Dominion University , along with Old Dominion Freight Lines , would like to apologize for the actions of these men . We are an educational institution that prepares young people for the real world . This week , some of our female students found out that some men are only interested in sex . This runs contrary to the reality of this world , where all sexual activity is had within the confines of a committed relationship and all children are born into a married and monogamous family . "
