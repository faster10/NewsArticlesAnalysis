First , make sure it ' s a genuine Assisted Computing Facility , and not an Assisted Living Facility . To tell the difference , observe the residents . If they look rather old and tend to openly discuss bowel movements , this is probably assisted living . On the other hand , if they vary in age and say things like , " I ' m supposed to figure that out ? I ' m not Bill goddamned Gates you know ! " , this is probably assisted computing .
