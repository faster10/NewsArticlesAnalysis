Winters says there ' s the usual blood , sweat , and tears on his white coat . There ' s also phlegm , vomit , stool , spinal fluid , joint fluid , amniotic fluid , and peritoneal fluid . He ' s accumulated egg , bacon , ketchup , mustard , avocado , tuna salad , barbecue sauce , and grits on there . There are random streaks of pen , marker , and crayons ( at least 5 colors ) too . The largest and oldest stain is from when he tripped and landed in a muddy puddle nearly 10 years ago to this day .
