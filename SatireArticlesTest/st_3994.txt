( On 2012 ) " We are going to have a 2012 . I don ' t know who is going to be a part of it . You know , I have faith is a very big part of my life . And putting my life in my creator ' s hands this is what I always do . I ' m like , OK , God , if there is an open door for me somewhere , this is what I always pray , I ' m like , don ' t let me miss the open door . Show me where the open door is . Even if it ' s cracked up a little bit , maybe I ' ll plow right on through that and maybe prematurely plow through it , but don ' t let me miss an open door . And if there is an open door in ' 12 or four years later , and if it is something that is going to be good for my family , for my state , for my nation , an opportunity for me , then I ' ll plow through that door . But I can ' t predict what ' s going to happen . I can ' t predict what ' s going to happen a day from now , much less four years from now . "
