Some men , they say , are born to the mines . Others are born to dance . They know , in their beings , what to do , how to do it . Shellsong , of course , knew nothing of men or mines . But he did know about love . He was born to love . He understood love . In his spiracled cicadean soul , he knew what to do , how to do it . He knew that his song , the plaintive cry from his taut , tymbaled loins , would prove irresistible . And he knew that his love , his mate , would return his call with a click .
