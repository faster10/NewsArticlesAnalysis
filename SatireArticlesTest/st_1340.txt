" Shhhhhh , not now , there ' s a grizzly , " said internist Ken Thomas , making rounds in the hospital ' s grizzly territory , Unit 3B . " When playing dead , it ' s best to lie on your stomach , vital organs to the ground , and cover your neck with your arms and hands . But if it fights , you ' ve got no choice but to fight back ! " He added : " Never round on patients here without packing your bear spray . "
