" I ' m sitting there , drinking my Joe , waiting for the light to turn green , and I must ' ve gotten distracted by something , because I spilled a little bit as I was sipping it , " Grant told us , " and the next thing I know , I ' m looking at the cup to see if there ' s a hole in it somewhere , and what do my eyes see but an image , clear as shit , of Jesus Christ himself ! " Grant said there on his coffee cup , which was decorated in a festive way for the holidays , was a faint but very distinguishable image of Jesus of Nazareth , who Grant said he ' d " recognize anywhere , " but not because of his Christian faith , which is quite strong , but because he ' s seen Christ in other locations before .
