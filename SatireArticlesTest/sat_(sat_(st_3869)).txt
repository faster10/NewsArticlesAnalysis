I do remember putting the chain through the front door handles for the last time , locking the padlock and walking over to my car , a 1986 Turbo 900 Saab , where my two best friends , Steve Peloquin and Davie Feldman , sat waiting . All our bags were packed and stuffed in the trunk and we drove out the Lincoln Tunnel to start a weeks long road trip . They were worried about my sanity , I think they wanted me out of the City and under their guard for awhile so I didn ' t do anything stupid . It wasn ' t my best time and they probably did save my life . Thanks , guys .
