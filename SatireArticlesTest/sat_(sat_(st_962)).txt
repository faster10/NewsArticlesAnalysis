This study has engendered some controversy . One far fetched and ludicrous claim by jealous academic know it alls is that there should have been a baseline comparison analysis between the texting on cell phone group and the control group , as this may have led to a radical concept called , " selection bias . " It is notable that this possibility was considered but not analyzed in the study due to the fact the study author and author of this article wasn ' t really paying attention when that um . part was discussed in their meeting because he was uh busy playing Words With Friends on his , um , cell thingie . Woo hoo ! Triple Word Score !
