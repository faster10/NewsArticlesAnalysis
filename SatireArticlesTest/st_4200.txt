But to at least half the Tea Party , all of these people ( and me too as a White Liberal Democrat ) are just wrong and bad for America and so , sooner or later , we ' ll all have to go . They want an America ruled by White Christians . Sure , there ' s gonna be some Black People , you really can ' t avoid it ( pity , that ) , but as long as they ' re Baptist and , at least if Rand Paul gets his way , they don ' t have to serve em in their stores , The Tea Party will just have to put up with it . For awhile anyway .
