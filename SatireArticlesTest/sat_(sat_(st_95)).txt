" This site is absolutely incredible ! " explains Albrecht R mschtein , an historian from the Lorand E tv s University in Budapest and member of the team of specialists investigating the tomb . " We found many horse skeletons , as well as various weapons and other artefacts , all traditionally associated with Huns . These objects include a large sword made of meteoric iron , which could certainly be Attila ' s legendary " Holy War Sword of the Scythians " , allegedly given to him by the god Mars himself . In fact , this definitely seems to be the resting place of the almighty Attila , but further analysis needs to be done to confirm it . "
