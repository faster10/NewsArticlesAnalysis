I have repeatedly said that I would never knowingly reveal any secrets that would harm our government or it ' s people . I can tell you this with complete confidence , no matter what the Fitzgerald prosecution and the jury at my trial said . I feel like the jury didn ' t understand that . I was terribly disappointed by their verdict , but it ' s like I was once told by Dick Cheney , it ' s hard to keep focused when everyone is saying you ' re wrong . If they knew the whole story , I ' m sure they ' d be solidly behind us and what we ' re trying to do , but of course we can ' t divulge all of our strategies to the public , as our enemies would hear of them as well . That is why being convicted in the scandal over Valerie Plame ' s identity is so ironic .
