" I would first like to extend our sympathies to the families who lost loved ones . The big picture here is that with an open society , no one expects to have horrific event such as we witnessed yesterday , take place . Lindt is proud of the actions taken by Caf employees to ensure our guests ' safety and comfort under extreme conditions we hope never to experience again . We invite our patrons to visit us in the future and we thank everyone for their continued support and patronage . "
