" Incidentally , we ' re very breast feeding friendly here . No one ' s saying a mom has to bottle feed her baby . But , let ' s say he ' s jaundiced and under the lights . Mom ' s insurance company won ' t pay for her to stay past 6 : 30 this evening and there ' s Similac in the cupboard . If a baby knows his mommy is leaving the hospital with or without him , he may be more motivated to do the right thing . And that is to freaking eat . "
