With a population of 800 , 000 , this city was founded in the year of the American Revolution ( 1776 ) although none of our fore fathers such as George Washington , Benjamin Franklin and the somewhat lesser known Skinny McElvey had a clue about it at the time . And why should they ? Back then , San Francisco was just a small collection of adobe huts with very little in the way of nightlife to recommend it a few car washes , a Burger King and Lefty ' s , an intimate little bistro where missionaries , Red Indians and Transvestites could mingle in peace and without stigma . It was hard for missionaries to find acceptance back then . This was mostly due to a misunderstanding of the phrase , " I ' d give my right arm for a good Transvestite . "
