Twenty some odd years later I can still remember walking across their parking lot to my Saab . It was a nice , warm , sunny day . I ' d successfully negotiated down a million dollars debt to twelve hundred , all by myself . I wasn ' t elated or anything after all , I ' d just lost twelve hundred bucks but I was relieved ? Satisfied ? I don ' t know , something approaching feeling good . By admitting defeat , I ' d won .
