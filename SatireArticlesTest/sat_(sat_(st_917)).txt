The most successful admitting providers are trained in the arts of ninjutsu and parkour . They bring a patient in without ever being seen or heard in the emergency room . They always choose the path of least resistance . They know the quickest route between an ER entrance and a patient room , even if it requires dive rolls , wall flips , or crawling through air ducts . They also provide crucial intelligence for other admitting providers : " Johnson is working tonight he ' s a sieve . "
