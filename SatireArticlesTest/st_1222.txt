Dr Nim explained : " The first time I did this , I was angry and frustrated . I just told the patient I was a certified fibromy ogist . I gave her high doses of Benadryl , Haldol , and Ativan and I turned the TV music station to the Enya music station . Then , much like Mr Miyagi from the Karate Kid , I rubbed my hands together and shot healing rays at the patient . I made up some garbage about magnetic fields in my hands purging toxins of the fibro out of her system . "
