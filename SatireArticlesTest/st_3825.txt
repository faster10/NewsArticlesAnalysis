About twenty five years ago , I was in Pete ' s Tavern down by Gramercy Park in New York with a motley collection of foreigners one Irishman , one Londoner , one German and a South African woman . Everyone spoke English to varying degrees and being pretty drunk , the conversation was quite convivial . At one point , the three guys went away two to the bar and one to the men ' s room to pay off the loan of the beer . The woman said to me , " So , I know everyone else ' s nationality , but I can ' t recognize your accent . What country are you from ? "
