For my part , I want someone who knows how things work , has made friends on both sides of the aisle , is more or less middle of the road who may just be able to get this country back to square one , they way we were in 2000 , before Bush . In other words , I want the Clinton years back . Sure the GOP hated Bill , but at least they hated him because he was successful and they only way they could hit him was by going after him because he tried to hide a consensual affair from his wife . And they hated Hillary because she tried to give the country a healthcare program , the very thing they ' re all clamoring for now anyway . Hell , even Barak Obama says he wants a Clinton on his team .
