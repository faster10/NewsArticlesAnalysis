" This is more than just a product to us . It ' s a service to the human race . Free , clean , breathable air for every human isn ' t a right , nor should it be . That would interfere with our right , as a corporation , to make an honest living for ourselves . If these fascist eco terrorists want to strip away our rights , too bad . We ' ll fight back , because this is America , and America is all about freedom . "
