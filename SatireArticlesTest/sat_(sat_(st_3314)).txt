If it ' s a whole region that doesn ' t have a particular religious significance but a geo political one , like Kashmir , then not just Indians and Pakistanis , but everyone in the world owns it , and yet no one owns it . Hindus and Muslims are free to build temples there , but each respects the other ' s right to worship in the way they see fit . Once again , no roast beef dinners or bacon , lettuce and tomato sandwiches ( you get the idea , so I ' ll stop beating that one to death it ' s making me hungry . ) .
