Various small stone Tools and weapons were found near the bodies , including an axe , two knives , a spear point and even two miniature sewing needles . These items suggest that the Homo Minisculus had only reached a technological level comparable to human hunters gatherers from the Paleolithic period , as no pottery or metal items have been found on the site . Many bones from various small animals including squirrels , hares , moles and hedgehogs were found near the settlement , many of which bore traces of cooking .
