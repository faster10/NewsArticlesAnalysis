Hilton contacted the charity " Playing for Good " to arrange a five day humanitarian fashion trip to Rwanda . The idea of models for food was a unique take , even for the progressive charity , according to founder Scott Lazerson . " While Paris ' trip will bring a good deal of attention to the plight of those living in Rwanda , the idea of bringing emaciated women to put on U . S . fashion runways is kind of sending a mixed message on the whole starvation thing . " However , for reasons that Lazerson would not reveal , he is not stopping Hilton , saying only " those internet sex tapes truly do her talent no justice . " But Hilton disagrees on the Rwanda models . " Americans are fat but have fashion . These girls are skinny , but have no fashion . I see it as a perfect fit . "
