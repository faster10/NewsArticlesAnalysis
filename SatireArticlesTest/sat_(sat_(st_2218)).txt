" Of course not , " was how Gachette answered , and when pushed for a further explanation said emphatically , " shall not be infringed . " Reporters then asked Mr Gachette if he would be alarmed or concerned if he were a Democrat by the NRA ' s promotion of Owens ' piece . " No , of course not , " Gachette said , " because a ) I ' d never be a Democrat and b ) if I was , I ' d be one of the good ones that knows that the point of America is for everyone to own massive piles of firearms and really , not much else .
