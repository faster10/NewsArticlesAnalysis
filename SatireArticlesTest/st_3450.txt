Chertoff ' s job is to protect the homeland from manmade and natural disasters . Remember how well he did with Hurricane Katrina ? One didn ' t need intelligence analysis or stomach gas to see that disaster coming all you had to do was turn on the Weather Channel and chart the storm track .

" Chertoff ' s dome somehow escaped the chopping block as he is skilled at arranging scary doomsday scenarios .
