A person describing himself as " an anonymous highly placed official " called the US Anti Doping Agency to say he knows of several lawmakers using an undetectable conscience suppressing substance . The official provided a syringe for testing and named a San Mateo County man , Victor Conte , and his lobbying firm , PhRMA , as the source of the CSD contained in the syringe . The agency then notified federal authorities of the discovery of a previously undetectable designer CSD and named PhRMA , through its subsidiary , SNAC , or Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning , as the source of the drug . Agency chief Terry Madden said several lawmakers have tested positive for the drug , calling it a " conspiracy " of lobbyists , chemists and politicians that represents " intentional doping of the worst sort , " and the largest conscience suppressing drug scandal in U . S . history .
