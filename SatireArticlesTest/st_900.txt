Needless to say the OR nurses are ecstatic . RN Jessica Charm said she used to have to do lamaze breathing just to make it through a day in the OR with Dr Booger . " Now it ' s a pleasure to come to work , " she said . " I ' ll ask him a question and before he answers I ' ll hear him saying , under his breath , to himself , Use my talking voice , use my talking voice , " ' and then he ' ll answer in the nicest way . "
