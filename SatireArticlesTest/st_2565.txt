The audience immediately responded with a standing ovation , loud cheers and foot stomping , with chants of Sarah ! Sarah ! Sarah ! lasting a full minute . After the cheers died down , Palin remarked , " You know , this isn ' t my first time at the roundup , and it ' s all part of the game . I ' ve heard ' em all . I ' ve probably had more cheap shots fired at me than any living politician today . It ' s like someone put a target on a map and ' Poor Old Sarah Palin ' is the X that marks the spot for those pesky liberals ! " The remark was greeted with a second standing ovation .
