Vietnam and Gulf War veteran and former US Army Depleted Uranium Project director Doug Rokke charges that the Department of Defense ( DOD ) deliberately ignores its own orders for testing soldiers who come in contact with DU . In August , 1993 , General Eric Shinseki issued an order requiring training for anyone who " may come in contact " with DU equipment , complete medical testing for solders " exposed to DU contamination , " and the development of " a plan for DU contaminated equipment . " Rokke cites a number of other orders including an April 2004 Surgeon General ' s order and US Army regulations requiring medical and environmental clean up from DU contamination .
