My uncle said this to me as he grabbed the last slice of pizza from right under my nose . I chuckled for a few days , but then as I started to actually understand the joke , I belly laughed for a little over a month . I don ' t know what was so funny about the situation : the fact that there was only one slice of pizza left , that I was about to take that slice of pizza , or that my uncle took it instead of me . All I know is that his quick remark will stick in my head for many years to come .
