Right , onto the plane , and by the time I get to my row it turns out it ' s a middle seat . Ugh , right ? I ' m kinda tall , so that ' s an issue . And I ' m a little infinite , if I ' m honest . Just before we take off the flight attendant comes up to me and says , I ' m sorry but you ' re too big for just one seat . You ' ll have to deplane or buy an extra seat . " ' Now I am pissed . Why did she let me on the plane if that ' s a problem ? To embarrass me in front of everyone ? And naturally she ' s a bit chunky herself . Which , yes , I proceed to point out . By asking if she ' s pregnant . Via Arnold Schwarzenegger . Cause he likes em big . And then these huge TSA guards show up with Tazers . Anyway , the bottom line is I pay extra because now I ' m holding up the flight and I m running late . That ' s it . That ' s the only reason .
