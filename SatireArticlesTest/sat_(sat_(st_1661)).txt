Ms . Fiorina told reporters she wasn ' t worried about the big differences in training between herself and Drago because she was " an American and as such she was capable of doing things better , just by virtue of being American . " Fiorina , who ran and lost for a Senate seat out of California in 2010 , said that as the night of the bout approached , she knew she was going to win . " It was round after round of intense boxing . But I knew I would win , and rest assured , by the end of the match , the crowd that had been chanting ' Drago ! Drago ! Drago ! ' suddenly was chanting ' Carly ! Carly ! Carly ! ' "
