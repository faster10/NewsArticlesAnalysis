One thing is clear from last Saturday night in Dallas . The former commander in chief unveiled his latest art exhibit and guests suddenly left in a hurry before it was over .

All requests for comment from the Bush family have so far gone unanswered . Brother Jeb Bush , a candidate for the presidency in 2016 , could not be reached as of press time .
