As I drank the flat tasting soft drink , the agitation of my surroundings started to unnerve me with all the Mexican noise and commotion going on . Unruly children laughed and sprinted up and down the aisle . One young girl , chased by her older brother , shrieked with laughter when he closed in within arm distance of her . Crying children howled as if they were being tortured , their mothers ignoring them as they gossiped with each other in Mexican . I even noticed one breastfeeding her child while she ate her dinner .
