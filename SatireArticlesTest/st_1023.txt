According to hospital sources , cleaning staff were instructed to clean room 304 , but instead accidentally ventured into room 303 . Mrs Waxerton , exhausted from her evening of sundowning had pulled a white sheet up over her head and sank into the ICU bed for some much needed rest . The cleaning crew was puzzled by the site of a human body in the bed still under a white sheet . The Cleaning Manual 3 . 0 next instructs workers to look at the whiteboard for a plan for today in situations of possible deceased patients in rooms . If no plan exists on the whiteboard , " the bed is to be wheeled to the morgue . "
