" What kind of world are we living in where we can ' t automatically assume every act of terrorism is carried out by a Muslim , " Calvin asked his followers on Saturday morning . The previous day , Robert Lewis Dear entered a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado Springs , Cololrado and began opening fire with at least one semi automatic long gun in his possession . At the time of publication , not all of the details of the shooting have been released , but after Dear was apprehended alive , it was immediately determined the suspect had not been an unarmed black teenager , as experts in police use of force say that would have ended up almost certainly with the suspect dead . Calvin said in his Facebook post that he was " devastated to learn " that Dear was the shooter because he " couldn ' t believe that people like Rush Limbaugh would lie " to him about who the majority of the terrorists in America are .
