The Southern Poverty Law Center points to statistics to back up their claim . More than 30 , 000 Americans are killed by firearms each year in this country . And while some are chalked up to accidents and self defense , most are done with malice . When it comes to " Mass Shootings less than 30 Americans die each year . That amounts to less than 0 . 1 of all gun deaths in the U . S . According to the S . P . L . C . , the majority of gun deaths happen in low income neighborhoods in urban areas , a demographic that the S . P . L . C . knows all too well . This inner city deaths account for tens of thousands of deaths each year , or over 1 , 000 times the amount of deaths from " Mass Shootings . "
