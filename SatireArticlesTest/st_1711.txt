Even some Democrats have decided to support the issue . House Minority Leader Nanci Pelosi ( D CA ) said that , " As Democrats of course we ' d rather do something more substantive about gun control . But as Democrats , we ' re also totally willing to roll over and play dead on guns because we fear the NRA . So you know , there ' s that . " Pelosi said that " the Kevlar thing for schools does sound like an over the top and unnecessary idea when we could just try to limit how many crazy people get guns , but YOLO ! "
