In typical fashion , the Pyxis machine will either break or run out of medications from pharmacy for the nurses caring for patients in the ED . The season premiere has two nurses slice their hands breaking open glass ampules . " Several nurses actually have to be admitted for herniated discs themselves after trying to move a 480 lb drunk patient to the CT scanner .
