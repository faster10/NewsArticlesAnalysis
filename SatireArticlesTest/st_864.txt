A couple physician Dolphins were present for this historic air birth as well . She was able to find an OB GYN that practices natural air births . She even had an anesthesiologist dolphin to help ! To be fair , the dolphin anesthesiologist is a much easier occupation than their human counter part . If you miss intubating a dolphin airway , you don ' t deserve to be in the sea . The pediatrician wanted nothing to do with this risky procedure , and didn ' t want to be on the chart in case they had to go to maritime court .
