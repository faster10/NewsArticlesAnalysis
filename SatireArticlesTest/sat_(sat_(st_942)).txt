SOMEWHERE OVER HOBOKEN , NJ It ' s amazing how there is always a doctor around when you need one . Hardly 200 miles into my flight out of Albany last Thursday , a young woman in 3B could not wait any longer to find one . " Is there a doctor on board ? . " she shouted , interrobang and all . Casually , I did my best to ignore the anxious din roar through the cabin , tending to the Angry Birds on my Kindle Fire . " PLEASE SOMEBODY HELP ! SHE ' S HAVING A BABY ! . " they kept calling out . Dear God . Hopelessly , the passengers and crew fumbled around with the imminent delivery , trying to make way for an extra passenger to board the flight .
