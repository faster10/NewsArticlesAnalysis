" Most mass shooting events happen within private homes , " God said , " look the numbers up for yourselves . That ' s real . So it ain ' t gun free zones that are killing people . It ' s people with guns using guns the way they were intended to be used . The solution isn ' t that hard to find . You don ' t confiscate , you regulate , and there is a big and important distinction between those two ideas . " He went on to describe the difference as confiscation " amounting to rights subversion " and regulation being " more like rights limitation , " which he said all adults realize you need to do so " you don ' t live in a consequence free universe . "
