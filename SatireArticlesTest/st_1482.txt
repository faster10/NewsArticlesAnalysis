It was last October outside of Baltimore , when Olivia Morris , then six years old , went to her parents and told them that she was a wizard . Her parents , Darnell Morris and PattyMae Deerfield , for religious reasons , had kept any talk of magic , wizardry or the occult from entering the house and away from their daughter ' s ears . " There will never be any mention of Harry You Know Who in our home , " PattyMae stated firmly when asked about Olivia ' s claim . " When she said that , I said , Oh , no , you ' re not , Olivia , " ' but Olivia said , I know I ' m not , Mommy , but I used to be . I was an Imperial Wizard . "
