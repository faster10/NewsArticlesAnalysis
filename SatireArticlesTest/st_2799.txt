MADISON , WISCONSIN Republican state legislators in Wisconsin made headlines this week when they advanced a bill that would force all people seeking public assistance to pass a drug screening and provided they urinate a result deemed acceptable by the lawmakers , they would be issued food stamps that could only be spent on a specific , limited scope of food products . Critics of both measures call it punishing of the poor , and they point to recent failed attempts in Florida and elsewhere to drug screen welfare recipients . Florida ' s Republican Governor Rick Scott was able to convince his state lawmakers a couple of years ago to drug test people on welfare , and the results were great for the drug testing companies ' profit margins , but if the goal was to catch people on welfare who are also high on drugs , it was an abysmal failure .
