Kesey and Babbs organized a troupe of freaks and misfits called the Merry Pranksters to travel the country and distribute ellis dee along with pot and sexual favors on a massive scale to willing townsfolk and teens . They rode in an International Harvester Bus with a moniker of " Furthur " and painted with swirling drug influenced designs and antichrist symbols . Many a Sadie Hawkins dance or homecoming was thrown out of control when participants would shoot up " doses " and release pent up sexual energy in front of shocked parents and teachers . Church seats and pews sat empty when this stoner circus came to town . Responsible adults and authority figures made note of the ellis dee debauchery and vowed to work for the prohibition of the drug .
