( On Opportunity ) " I ' m like , OK , God , if there is an open door for me somewhere , this is what I always pray , I ' m like , don ' t let me miss the open door , And if there is an open door in ' 12 or four years later , and if it is something that is going to be good for my family , for my state , for my nation , an opportunity for me , then I ' ll plow through that door .
