" The medical facts bear me out on this , " said Huckabee . " Doctors tell me that heat is generated up under the foundation garment which makes the water reduce down , which is what they want for their weight loss . That is an outward expression of vanity and pride . The data I ' ve seen proves that these morally corrupt underclothes severely constrict the female reproductive organs . Now it follows that if a woman is with child and wishes to terminate a pregnancy , perhaps to keep her figure , or perhaps out of convenience , that heinous act could be achieved when these restrictive corsets are pulled tighter and tighter , often in the privacy of their own home . This is another surreptitious way for the pro abortion crowd over there in Hollywood to oppose the 20 week abortion ban , and promote their agenda . "
