" We must eliminate poor people ! " Lieberman said . " Just yesterday I was in a hospital in Washington , DC that was filled to the brim with poor and elderly people . Some of them had cancer . Others had heart disease , poor circulation , kidney trouble , liver disease or had been in some kind of accident . Treatments for these things are very expensive ! I suggest we put these people back on the street where they belong to free up medical resources for the wealthy and well insured who can afford these services " .
