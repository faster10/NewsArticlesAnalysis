Now , people here will say , " Of course we have discourse and political debate , you East Coast asshole . " To which I answer , " Don ' t call me an asshole , shithead and you do not . What you have is a bunch of hysterical television commercials that completely misrepresent the issue , going so far as to word the title of the Prop to sound like voting yes on it means you ' re actually against it ( see Gay Marriage in the ' 08 election ) . Then you have whatever politicians up for election cravenly either supporting it or saying they ' re against it , sometimes both at the same time , depending on who they ' re talking to . "
