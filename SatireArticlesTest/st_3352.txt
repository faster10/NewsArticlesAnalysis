Post commanders realized this and decided to give Rocky ' s civilian customers , male or female , easier access through the gates . Instead of having to park their cars at the gate to register for a pass , civilians can request a special pass to Rocky ' s from a gate guard , show a driver ' s license and drive on through . Fort Stewart has issued at least 1 , 000 Rocky ' s passes since the club opened . " We had to weigh the force protection risk vs . the risk to our soldiers of drinking and driving , " Buchs said . " Is it a risk we ' re willing to accept ? Yes . " On a recent Friday night , women accounted for about 40 percent of the nightclub ' s customers . Jessica Kunkle , 19 , of neighboring Ludowici checked out Rocky ' s with her friend Veni Thelin , the wife of a Fort Stewart soldier . ( Rocky ' s allows patrons 18 and up , but only those 21 and older get a wristband allowing them to buy alcohol . )
