" I was having a little pre session snack of some Whoppers and Coke , when I dropped one of the Whoppers into my lap , where I guess I had spilled a little Coke earlier , " Yurtz , who has an ample lap , recalled . " And I looked down at it , sort of floating and bobbing around in the Coke , losing its chocolate coating . I realized , ' Hey , that could be a person down there . And now nobody ' s going to want to eat them . ' "
