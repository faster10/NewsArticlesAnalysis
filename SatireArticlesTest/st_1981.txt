Sources claim that Abrams , who is currently in production on Star Wars , Episode 7 , " The Force Awakens , " has spent the past three weeks jotting down notes and drawing out stick figure storyboards for a film he ' s tentatively titling " A New Frontier , " and has recently begun fleshing out the first few scenes of a screenplay . This film , which is little more than theoretical right now , would see the crew of the USS Enterprise crashing on Tatooine , the desert planet that both Anakin and Luke Skywalker had called their home .
