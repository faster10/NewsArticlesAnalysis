Irving Plaza would still be open to the public for another hour and we wouldn ' t ' prove out ' count the take and pay the band and staff , not to mention clean up , till six . Since I ' d usually get to work between noon and three , that meant three days of shows at around fifteen to eighteen hours each , or a forty or fifty hour work weekend . Add the Monday to Wednesday ten to six day shifts and you ' re floating around eighty hours total . Jesus , it ' s taken me twenty six years to add up those numbers no wonder I was too exhausted try it again when they finally locked me out .
