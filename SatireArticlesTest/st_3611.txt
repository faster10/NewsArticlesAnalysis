Webb speculates that the Bush administration covered up the suicide out of respect for the dead . He points out that , in an atmosphere of constant terrorist scare campaigns , including Washington DC sniper attacks and " the possibilities of sniper attacks on golf courses , " there was absolutely no speculation that this was a terrorist attack , despite the fact that Wellstone had hired an associate of Zacarias Moussaoui , the accused Sept . 11 conspirator , as a co pilot , and he makes the serious charge that " this is clear evidence of knowledge that suicide was the true cause of death at the highest levels of government . The team of FBI recovery agents left Minneapolis before Wellstone ' s plane took off , " Webb claims , " and records of private aircraft arriving in Duluth that morning have been conveniently destroyed . " Webb points out that that apparent prior knowledge was similar to Dallas police putting out an all points bulletin for Lee Harvey Oswald a half hour before he shot a police officer .
