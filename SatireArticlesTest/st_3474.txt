Now , this can be a pretty good thing . My wife gardens , so going to the store could easily imply a trip to someplace with tools , like Home Depot . That means while she ' s in the plant department I can stroll into the store and annoy the clerks in building materials with questions like ' what ' s the compression difference between Type N and Type M mortar , or , what ' s the clear span capability of a triple 2 10 on a load bearing exterior wall , with no second floor , but assuming a 1 , 000sf shed roof on a 6 12 pitch ? . ' Stuff like that just makes their day , I can tell you . It ' s a learning experience .
