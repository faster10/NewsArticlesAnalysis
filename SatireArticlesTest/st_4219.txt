Maryland Violent or child sex offenders in the state have been ordered by Maryland ' s Department of Parole and Probation to hang out orange pumpkin signs reading " No Candy " at their residences today . Wonda Adams , a field supervisor in that department warns that if the sex offenders don ' t comply , they will be visited by police . John McCain , speaking at a campaign stop in Hanoverton , Ohio said , " My friends , is this what we want during the next four years ? Sex Offenders luring our children with candy ? Why is Barack Obama silent on this issue ? Does that mean he supports Sex Offenders ? Well , Sarah Palin and I most certainly do not support Sex Offenders , my friends , but I could sure go for a Milky Way bar right now . "
