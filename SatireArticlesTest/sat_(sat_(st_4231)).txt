Bear in mind that I ' m telling you these in the spirit of international cooperation and universal love and that I ' m telling them to you only to lighten up the mood , so don ' t get all huffy like Dick Cheney does when I tell jokes about him . The first one is this : How many North Koreans does it take to starve to death ? Answer : All of them . Get it ? That one always makes me laugh . Another one goes like this : When your daddy was looking to pick a successor to take his place he said , " hmmm , who should I choose ? " and you jumped up yelling , " Pygmy ! Pygmy ! " Once ( and I thought this one up all by myself ) Condi Rice came running in to my office saying , " Mr President , we have a problem with North Korea ! " I answered , " Why , is Kim Jong Ill ? " That sure broke up Dana Perino , I ' ll tell you . I like having pretty women working for me because I listen better . I wish Dick Cheney was a pretty girl . Do you have pretty women in North Korea ?
