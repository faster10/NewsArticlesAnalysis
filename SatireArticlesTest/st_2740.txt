" You know this is pretty hard , " Trump said , " being a Republican presidential candidate . You have to be convincingly racist , without being overtly convincingly racist . It ' s a delicately balanced tight rope act I ' m doing , and I just hope I can make everyone from the mildly discriminatory to the full blown racist happy . I ' m not used to pleasing anyone but myself , and only then with pictures of myself pleasing myself in my 30 ' s wait what ? Anyway , bing bang boom , Trump 2016 , suck it haters ! PEACE ! "
