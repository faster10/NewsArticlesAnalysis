( On Clothes ) " They were really nice gals . They were wonderful people . And you know , it was , I guess , productive , in a sense , in that they picked out some really nice clothes to borrow for a while there . But that was not anything that the Palin family would have chosen for ourselves . In fact , I ' m much more comfortable in my own skin , in my own clothes . And you know , I guess it was just part of a strategy that , perhaps , you know , in hindsight , looking back , if people had to do something over again , I think they would have been more than happy , at this point , to reverse some of that and let me go back to Alaska , pack my own bags , wear my own clothes on the trail . And that could have reflected , too , I think , more of who we are , our family as Alaskans , you know , unpretentious , not trying to change anything about appearance or what we represent . And maybe some of that is has to do with the clothes . "
