" I was so glad to see that there were others out there spending as much , if not more time on the couch than I was , " said Tom Corniers , a pulmonologist . " Facebook makes it look like everyone is happy , being productive , or going on a constant vacation . This app helps gives the world a much more realistic view inside my life , and I feel better about it , since I see others doing the exact same thing now . Gotta run to go binge watch GOT on my couch and consume 2000 calories while doing so . Expect a FB post soon . "
