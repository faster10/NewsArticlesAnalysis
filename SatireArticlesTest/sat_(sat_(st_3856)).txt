Finally , since I ' ve beaten the ' anonymous ' gag to death , Waterhouse concluded , " So there you are : forget Ron Paul ' s one trillion in one year or Herman Cain ' s " 999 " deal . With me as president , you get NO taxes , everybody has a job , or at least a mission , we don ' t ever have to worry about taking care of old or sick people , overpopulation is gone forever , we don ' t have to pay China back one red cent so the deficit is gone and everyone can be as rich as they want as long as their aim is good . America will one again be respected , or at least feared , in the world and all our problems will be solved . Now , I know it may sound a bit extreme , especially to the peace crowd , but believe me , you put a gun in a Hippie ' s hands , drop him in the middle of Nigeria with no food or water and he ' ll get over that ' Make Love , Not War ' ethos real damn quick . So , when you get in the voting booth , just pull the trigger for " Anonymous " and let ' s get America back on track tank tracks to be precise . "
