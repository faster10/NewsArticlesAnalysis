When Monson was asked if this new revelation changed anything he answered " No . . . not really . We ' ll still maintain our customs and our rituals which will always serve to maintain strong communal bonds . We will still forbid alcohol and caffeine , cause those things are bad for you . We ' ll still be kind and gentle neighbors and we will still send missionaries all over the world to spread our message . We want people to join us . We just don ' t want God getting in the way of that . "
