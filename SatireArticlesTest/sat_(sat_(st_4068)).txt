" The Bible is clear on marriage , " said Malarkey . " The Hebrew words for male and female are actually swear words for male and female genitalia , which can ' t be repeated in polite company . Our God never said ' be gay , ' instead , with these two words , he created wedding vows , prohibited divorce , demanded fidelity and obedience from women , set rules for property to be passed down to the eldest son , ordained the family and demanded that we pass a constitutional amendment protecting white privileges over the whole earth .
