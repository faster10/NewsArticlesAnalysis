Scientologists like Alley , Cruise , Beck Hansen , Greta van Susteren , John Travolta , Jenna Elfman , and Priscilla Presley believe all human beings are Thetans , the descendants of two creatures from another galaxy who were left on Earth by the Mothership millions of years ago . Thetans are born with Original Dysfunction , a state of confusion and longing for drugs inherited from the two original Thetans , Mork and Mindy , who refused to donate any of their fruit to the First Universal Cooperative . Therefore , all Thetans are possessed of Engrams , physical and emotional scars acquired in previous lives , and are doomed to endure successive reincarnations on Earth until they have donated a sufficient amount of money to Scientology .
