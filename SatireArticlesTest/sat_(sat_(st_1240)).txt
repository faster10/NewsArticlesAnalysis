" Instead of pumping highly artificial , processed chemicals like sevoflurane or propofol into my patients excuse me , my clients I instead have started distilling juniper berries and coriander seed in fresh , unfiltered mountain spring water . After three weeks and running it through some copper tubing , I have a clean , clear , natural anesthetic which works with the body ' s pain receptors instead of antagonizing them . I soak an artisanal scrap of hand loomed cotton cloth and gently stuff it into the patient ' s mouth . "
