This astounding discovery seems to confirm the 17 th Century writings of William Strachey , a secretary of the Jamestown Colony . He wrote in his The historie of travaile into Virginia Britannia in 1612 , that four English men , two boys and one girl had been sighted at the Eno settlement of Ritanoc , under the protection of a chief called Eyanoco . This mysterious settlement had however evaded discovery until now , as its location was not clearly mentioned by the author and no other mention of it or its chief have ever been recorded .
