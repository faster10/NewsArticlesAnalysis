Gemelli began photographing cloud patterns in Topeka , Kansas the heart of " Tornado Alley with a high speed camera , capturing moments when rapidly developing cloud formations would form . " The high speed capture was a happy accident , actually , " explained Gemelli . I forgot to reset my camera from a previous project I had going . So I looked at the footage and I noticed something strange . When clouds moved in front of the sun , their edges , or the so called silver linings we all talk about , seemed to shift and vibrate very rapidly right before a microburst . My camera picked that up . "
