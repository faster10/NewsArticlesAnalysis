Jefferson City , MO ( APE ) President Bush yesterday made an appearance in Missouri to sell his new Medicare D prescription drug benefit plan to senior citizens . Critics say the plan , much like the Bush administration itself , has been leaking like a sieve since its onset . The Bush administration now owes over 40 states millions in funding that they pledged in good faith to literally prevent seniors from dying during the transition to the controversial plan . Democrats opposed to the program have also produced figures demonstrating that in actuality it will wind up costing taxpayers 700 billion , almost twice the the low ball , massaged estimate of 400 billion over 10 years , initially floated by the White House .
