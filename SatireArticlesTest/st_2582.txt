If passed , the amendment would set aside state tax dollars to create the SCFBI the South Carolina Female Body Inspection task force . It ' s purpose would be to knock on the door of every woman whose doctor reports a miscarriage to a new state pregnancy registration database that would also be created in an effort to " track the vaginal and uterine activities of all South Carolinian women . " According to Thompaulsen , any SCFBI agent who finds that a woman lied about having a miscarriage and instead got an abortion " just so she could shirk the responsibility of raising and paying for that kid with zero help from her small state government purposefully kept small so we can ' t help people we force into birthing kids , " will be " given a demerit , " since the punishments associated with the abortion ban are all for the doctors who provide them .
