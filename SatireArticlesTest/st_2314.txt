Ryan said that though he didn ' t win the contest for ownership of the factory , he wasn ' t sad about it all these years later . He says that losing that contest helped prepare him for losing abysmally in 2012 as one half of a Mitt Romney presidential ticket that sputtered its way to an embarrassing landslide of a defeat . " I was sure bummed about losing the contest and having to be restored to my original size that day , " Rep . Ryan told the media , " but I haven ' t been able to stop thinking about one of those golden egg laying geese we saw that day . I want one , and I ' ll have one , or they can find another speaker .
