The west coast group began as Mother Mcree ' s Uptown Jug Champions , but quickly changed their name to The Warlocks because it was easier to spell . Unfortunately , The Warlocks also happened to be the name of a band that would later change it ' s name to The Velvet Underground , while Capitol Records signed a third band named The Warlocks who no one ever heard from again . In the late sixties the band changed their name again to The Grateful Dead and stayed that way until they became Phil Lesh and Friends after the death of front man Jerry Garcia .
