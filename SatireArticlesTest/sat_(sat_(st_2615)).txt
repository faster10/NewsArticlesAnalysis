" I just hope the carpet bombs match the drapes my mom put up last year , " Samil told our reporter through an interpreter . " I mean , we ' d all like to be out of here sooner rather than later , because it really does suck watching radical Islamists and your government murder each other in the street , " Samil said with a surprisingly developed vocabulary for a four year old , " but if we ' re going to be trapped here because the very same countries that meddled in this region for years are turning their backs on us when we want to flee the chaos they fostered , I hope it ' s a nice , plush carpet we can take our shoes off and just feel the fibers !
