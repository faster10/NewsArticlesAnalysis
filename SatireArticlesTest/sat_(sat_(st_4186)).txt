The thing is , if I had healthcare at the time , I would ' ve gone to the doctor months earlier for what I had thought was only a bad ear ache and been given some antibiotics and would have never needed an operation at all . Instead , I waited till I almost died they told me two weeks more and it would ' ve been too late . But when you have no insurance , you just don ' t go to a doctor and instead hope you ' ll get better .
