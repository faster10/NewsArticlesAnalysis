" I will be in my cabin for as long as it takes to come up with the number of corpses it ' ll take for the NRA to allow discussion of gun violence that leads to new laws , " LaPierre said , " but hopefully I ' m in there long enough to where you all have forgotten about this latest mass murder that we ' ll do nothing to address .
