Eventually , I ' ll go on vacation . To Rio De Janeiro . Once there , I ' ll step off a tour bus to take some photos of sad people . A street rat will come running up to me . He ' ll be all , " Give me your fancy camera or I ' ll kill you . " in Mexican or whatever . And I ' ll be all , " Never , you poor . " And then he ' ll stab me , and go to grab the camera from around my neck . But I ' ll grab his hand and stare deeply into his eyes , and The Smiths ' " There Is a Light That Never Goes Out will start to play right at the " To die by your side would be a heavenly way to die ie part . His eyes will well with tears , and he ' ll have revelations about how he ever got there and we ' ll zoom out over the whole city at magic hour .
