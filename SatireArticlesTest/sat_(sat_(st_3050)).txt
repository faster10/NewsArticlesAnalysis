According to assistant U . S . attorney Griff DeMour of the Department of Justice , which handles bankruptcy filings , PSINet was a " shoo in , " but noted many other companies have equally valid claims . " I think a lot of the dot coms , particularly in the consulting sector , are eligible for Chapter 51 , " said DeMour . " But I also expect to see filings soon from heavily in debt heavy hitters like Lucent , which actually thought it could make money by loaning money to its customers , who would then use the money to buy Lucent products .
