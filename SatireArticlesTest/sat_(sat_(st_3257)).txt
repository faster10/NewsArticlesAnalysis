Before you leave the store , have a look out the window at the sky . Is it raining ? Does it look like it might rain ? If so , stay inside until the storm threat passes . Inside your shopping bag is a sleeping bag , hand crank radio and two protein bars to tide you over until the skies clear . The last thing you want to do is get even a single drop of water on your jeans , as it might detract from their authentic blueness .
