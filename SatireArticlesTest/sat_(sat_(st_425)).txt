" Brokenback Mountain is a fine movie , and even though I haven ' t seen it I ' m sure it ' s a strong contender for Best Picture , " said the President . " It has to be a movie with such a danged wonderful theme as gay cowboys brings back memories of ' Some Like It Hot ' , ' Tootsie ' , and ' To Wong Foo , Thanks For Everything , Julie Newmar , ' which are all regarded as classics . This new one is a sure bet to win , at least , best comedy of the year . "
