Ted Cruz ' s campaign is very happy about Kasich stepping out of the race . " State after state after state , he only got ten percent of the vote . It was obvious since Iowa that the people didn ' t want him . I ' m glad he finally came to his senses and dropped out , " said Cruz . " I ' m more than happy to represent his supporters and take the fight to Trump the Bully . With your support , we can slay the loud mouth New Yorker . "
