" I ' ll never forget that Sunday morning , " Fiorina told the Texans in attendance , " as I suited up and got my pads on , I just knew that something special was going to happen . " Fiorina said that she knew going into the fateful game that she was just " a few dozen yards short " of the record previously held by Walter Payton . " I went into that game knowing I had history within my grasp , " Fiorina told the audience , " and every time my QB gave me that ball , I was going to hit the hole hard , and not stop until that record was mine ! "
