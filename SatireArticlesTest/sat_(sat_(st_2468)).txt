Another commercial shows a waiter pointing to a sign on the sports themed restaurant ' s wall that reads , Beware of Scalpers ! as he says : " Don ' t worry ! That sign means stay away from those other restaurants that ' ll skin you alive ! But not us ! We won ' t treat you like savages ! Round up the whole family at Buffalo Bob ' s where our prices won ' t put you on the warpath ! And our policy is and always will remain the same : NO RESERVATIONS . "
