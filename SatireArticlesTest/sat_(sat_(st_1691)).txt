" We don ' t know who they are , but they ' re definitely OT 8 , " said one former Sea Org member , referring to the highest and most revered " auditing level " in Scientology . " They ' re the very clearest individuals . The ones who are closest to the faith and have the best understanding of it . The people who ' ve given the most money . I always dreamt of being OT 8 , but I could never afford it on a meager heart surgeon ' s budget . "
