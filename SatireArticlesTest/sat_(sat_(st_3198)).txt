" If we run out of vodka in first class , I have to find some more quickly or the passengers will revolt , " said U . S . Air flight attendant Janet Paugh . " Normally , I just grab some from the co pilot ' s stash while he ' s sleeping it off , but I ' m not going to do it if he ' s packing . Unless Pete Buck is in first class . Then I ' m better off facing the pilot . "
