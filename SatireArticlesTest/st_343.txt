" It was just the other day when I was cleaning out my grandpa ' s closet he just died last week and came across his old smoking jacket , " said Samson . " It was just like , ' Eureka ! ' and it occurred to me that by just wearing this smoking jacket in the store or maybe I ' ll have Vladimir , our designer , make me a new one with a Che Guevara motif embroidered in it that I could save the whole hipster community and get kids to start wearing smoking jackets out to bars , even if they don ' t smoke .
