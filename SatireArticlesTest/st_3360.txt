Anyway , it ' s not just Mrs Thomas ' little boy Clarence who thinks it ' s okay the American Chamber of Commerce thinks it ' s great idea too and it ' s hard to think of a more Liberal group than that , at least in Conservative politics . ( Ah , that ' s wrong it ' s really easy to think of more Liberal groups , even in Conservative politics , but I ' ve already written it and it ' s staying . I can ' t waste all day on this crap . ) Actually , they think it ' s such a great idea that they ' re denying it happens at all , pointing to the fact that they ' ve proved it doesn ' t by not opening up their books because it ' s legal for shadowy foreign governments and corporations to not contribute buckets of cash to our politicians without any public accountability too . Hah ! So there .
