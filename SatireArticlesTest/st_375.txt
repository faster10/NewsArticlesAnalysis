The " Drink and Dial " package allows for the automatic recording of all calls made after 11 : 30 P . M . on weekends and re plays the complete , incoherent conversations for dizzy dialers in the morning , allowing subscribers ample time to prepare for awkward confrontations with poor excuses and reassurances that " this doesn ' t happen often " . The feature also sounds an " opt out " alert before the call is even connected , letting users know that if they shut up now , humiliation and regret may be spared in the morning .
