But far be it from me to complain , although would it hurt so much to visit the family web site the site where you first learned how to code , I shouldn ' t have to mention ? I ' ve done some things around the place . Remember that animated . gif that your father used to love ? The one with the stupid dancing fish ? On the home page , he wanted it ! He insisted ! Well it ' s gone ! I ' m doing everything in Macromedia Flash now . Your father doesn ' t even know . G d forbid he should make time to visit his own wife ' s site .
