Banks have already paid back billions in Bailout monies . The stock market is up more than 4 , 000 points from when this man took office ( you can say that that means nothing to the little guy , but those companies whose stocks have rebounded represent a great part of their pension plans and retirement accounts ) . The housing market , that great real estate Ponzi Scheme that a great many of these same protesters used as an ATM with bathrooms , is beginning to stabilize hit it ' s bottom is probably a more accurate term and while the people who bought at it ' s peak are screwed , the government is still trying to help at least some of them to re work the binding legal documents they signed and allow them to keep those homes ( even odder , in some cases those foreclosures weren ' t so bad either I know one guy who put 15K down on a place , borrowed 55K out of it over 3 years , then when faced with foreclosure , stripped everything out of it , including the kitchen sink , and sold it in a huge yard sale . By his own estimate , after his monthly payments he came out around thirty grand ahead . )
