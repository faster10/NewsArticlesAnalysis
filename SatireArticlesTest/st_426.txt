" America . . . when Lincoln didn ' t give up . . . and neither did Martin Luther King . . . we can never get up , see ? " he said . " And what we can ' t give up is freedoms , and our freedom to give them up , and our freedom to give other people them . To make them have them , even . And gosh darnit , our freedom to take those freedoms away when they ' re not used in the correct way . "
