After my second husband dies , I will turn into a kraken of a woman . Deep down , I ' ve always been a garbage human , but as long as he ' s around , I ' ll be loving and caring . But after he dies , I ' ll be ruthless . I will scream at neighbour kids on my lawn , put out cigarettes on gaudy Christmas ornaments , tell mothers they have ugly babies who don ' t look like their " fathers , and buy people off registry gifts . At some point my first husband ( Elliot , I wanna say ? ) will drop by to tell me he ' s sorry that this better man , the love of my life and role model to his children , has died . And I ' ll be all , " You should really get those pants hemmed . You look ridiculous . "
