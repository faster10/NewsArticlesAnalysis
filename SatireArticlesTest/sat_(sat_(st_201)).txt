It is still unclear if the colonists were taken as prisoners or if they sought shelter with the Eno people , but Professor Monroe and his team believe that the colonists were most likely sold into slavery at some point in time and held captive by differing bands of the Eno tribe , who were known slave traders . They survived with the natives for many years , as Virginia Dare who was born in August 1587 , was estimated to have been around twenty years old at the time of her death .
