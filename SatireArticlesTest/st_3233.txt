But I ' m not sure when that ' ll be . I ' m sorry about that . I know it doesn ' t give you much time to plan and pass out leaflets and scare the sabbath out of each other . Maybe in the fall . Is that specific enough ? Tentatively let ' s say Fall 2011 . In October . Columbus Day maybe . That was apocalyptic , for some people . I told you I ' m into that karmic stuff . So I ' ll drop in then . Six p . m . Or 5 : 30 if you own a beach view ' motel on Cape Cod . Or work for the cable company .
