Mr Williams finally ran afoul of one organization , NPR , for comments he made while on the other , Fox ( Fairly Unbalanced ) to Bill O ' Reilly . Mr Bill had mentioned on yet another program , " The View " that seeing Muslims made him think that he was gonna get blown up ( cause they ' re all terrorists , you see ) , a comment that made Whoopie Goldberg and Joy Behar to walk off the set until Mrs O ' Reilly ' s little boy Billy said he was sorry . A tense situation diffused or was it ?
