" We believe that enough evidence now exists to push legislation forward for nurses to be included in this group , " vowed ANA president , Pam Cipriano . " These days there are lots of similarities between fast food employees and nurses . Both serve and prepare food . Both work early in the morning and late at night . Both cater to hungry patrons . Both take orders , refill drinks , and clean tables . Nurses should be compensated just as much as our fast food employees . "
