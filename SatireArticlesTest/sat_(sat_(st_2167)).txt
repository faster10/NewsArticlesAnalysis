" It was crazy , " said Horace Jr . The note was all gibberish . It didn ' t make any sense . The first thing it said was , ' Go back to where you cane . ' Then there were all these racist things . Horrible words . In big bold letters at the bottom it said , GO BACK HONE TO ISLAN SAMD MIGGER , and that ' s when I figured out what was going on . A bunch of dyslexic racists did all this damage ! I didn ' t know whether to get mad or feel pity , but when I told my father , he just said ' they probably were made fun of growing up , and that ' s why they turned out that way ' to be mean and racist , he meant .
