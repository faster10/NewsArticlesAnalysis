" Graduates of Yale University , I apologize if you have endured this type of prologue before , but I want you to do something for me . Please , take a good look around you . Look at the classmate on your left . Look at the classmate on your right . Now , consider this : five years from now , 10 years from now , even 30 thirty years from now , odds are the person on your left is going to be a loser . The person on your right , meanwhile , will also be a loser . And you , in the middle ? What can you expect ? Loser . Loserhood . Loser Cum Laude .
