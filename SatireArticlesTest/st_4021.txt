So Sarah Palin ' s Alaska charges businesses more than anyplace in the United States to work there , relies on an unsustainable resource for 80 of it ' s revenue , gets more Federal money than 47 other states , makes the oil industry pay through the nose to drill there and charges it ' s property owners more than 38 other states just to live there . No wonder she quit to join the Tea Party she must have been too ashamed to be associated with it . Or she knew that because of the Great Recession it was all about to blow up in her face . Tea Party people hate the Great Recession .
