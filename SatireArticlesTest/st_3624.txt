In the face of the first ever default on U . S . Treasury Notes in American history , Congress has voted to raise the National Debt Limit to nearly 9 Trillion ( 9 , 000 , 000 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) dollars . The nearly Party Line vote of 52 48 allows President Bush to tack an additional thirty thousand ( 30 , 000 ) dollars of debt onto every man , woman and child in the United States . The increase in the debt limit was accomplished after Congress placed emergency phone call to Visa Master Card and explained that it needed to raise it ' s limit in order to pay for the War in Iraq . Since Mr Bush took office , Republicans , or the Party of Fiscal Responsibility as they once were jokingly called , has increased the statutory debt limit by nearly three trillion ( 3 , 000 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) dollars . This comes in addition to President Bush just giving away nearly all of the 237 billion ( 237 , 000 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) budget surplus left to him by the Clinton Administration . The White House celebrated the newly found money by defeating an effort by Congressional Democrats to add 1 . 2 billion ( 1 , 200 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) for domestic security programs and asking Congress to remove Gray Wolves from the Endangered Species List .
