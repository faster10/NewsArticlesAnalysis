I know the many messages I leave at Justin Trudeau ' s door are a nuisance , but they are the most painless way to communicate how I feel . Sometimes when I imagine living without Justin Trudeau , I get so upset I think about lighting myself on fire . I know there are people who would think that ' s a creepy thing to say , Justin Trudeau , but you ' re smart enough to know that it isn ' t , and that those people should mind their own business .
