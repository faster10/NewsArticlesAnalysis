Our attempts to interview Mr Butterston did not go according to plan , however . Charlie is so busy with the store that he couldn ' t take time away from it , and we attempted to interview him as he conducted business . However , the cash registers in Charlie ' s shop are of the variety that one often finds in Hollywood portrayals of Old West saloons . All six registers were ringing throughout our interview , and no matter what questions we asked Butterston , he simply could not hear us over all the money being shoved into the registers as customers purchased their marijuana .
