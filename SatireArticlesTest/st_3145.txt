It was totally a last minute , impulse thing . You see , I was bombing near the Syria Lebanon border , knocking out a weapons convoy headed to Hezbollah from Iran , and I was like , " Hey , I wonder what ' s up with that chemical weapons research center near Damascus . And the barracks where Syria ' s top military hangs out . " True , Damascus is a long way from Tel Aviv , but it ' s not like I was walking . I was flying . It only took a few minutes . No biggie .
