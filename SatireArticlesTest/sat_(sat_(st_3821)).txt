But my father still sent his busses through Perth Amboy , Rahway and Elizabeth . He drove his shiny White Chrysler New Yorker with the " KCT 1 " plates , identifying him as Councilman Charles Terzella Sr . through the Black communities , his constituents . No one did a thing to him , no one threw even a rock , let alone took a shot a him . My Dad was right it turns out he was the man he ' d always tried to be and the people respected him for it .
