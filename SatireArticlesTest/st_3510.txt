I can agree with the government being able to isolate itself instantly in a crisis , I can live for a couple of days without access to any dot gov ' s . But even that shouldn ' t have to happen the government should be able to keep a spare laptop around that ' s outside the lockdown to keep us informed about who they ' re killing something inexpensive from Best Buy . And if they ' re gonna kick out 100 mil , it should be to help idiots from AT T or PG E protect themselves , not just to spy . Shit , they can go to any high school and find a bunch of kids to do that .
