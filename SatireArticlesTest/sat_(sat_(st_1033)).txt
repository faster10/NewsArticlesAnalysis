All it will involve is a breathing machine , a continuous infusion of general anesthesia , and probably a one week stay in our 8 , 000 per night intensive care unit . However , if you don ' t opt for this premium platinum package , you will have some pain . You literally got hit by a bus yesterday , have a broken leg , 6 broken ribs , and had emergency surgery to take your spleen out . Unfortunately , it is probably going to hurt . Yes , even if I give you that pain medication that starts with a D followed by some Benadryl because the D drug makes you itch and some Phenergan because the D drug makes you nauseated injuries hurt . Our abilities extend only into making the pain manageable , so that you can get out of bed and participate in your care .
