1 ) If your elected representative is a Republican ( after all , there ' s no point in blaming the Democrat ' s we knew what they were going to do . We just have to get them out , even the so called Conservative ones there ' s no such thing as a Conservative Democrat . ) , did he or she do enough to fight Obama care , aside from just not voting it ? If the answer is no ( and it obviously is ) , then we have to find a truly patriotic candidate to run against them in the primary , someone who really represents the values of the Movement . And we must donate as much money and time as we can to them , even if it means doing without some Necessities for our families . This is far more important than some new cell phones , clothes or shoes for our children .
