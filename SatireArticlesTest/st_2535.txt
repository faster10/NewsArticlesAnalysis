President Obama , who is at the tail end of his second presidential term , will also point out another way in which his life would be different if he were a real black man . " I don ' t think I ' d have gotten all the Birtherism stuff thrown my way , " the Commander in Chief will say , " because let ' s face it as much crap as I ' ve gotten from Republicans as a semi black man , imagine what it ' d be like if I were a real black man . If all the subtle and not so subtle dog whistle racism was given to me by my opponents for almost eight years as a semi black president , just imagine the ruthless , overt , candid racism we ' d see from them if I were a real black president . "
