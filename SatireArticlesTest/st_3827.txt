As for the Democrats , I can understand things pretty easily Jerry Brown makes 150 , 000 . 00 a year as AG , so winning would bring his salary up to 206 , 500 . 00 , a raise of 56 , 500 . 00 . Cuomo makes 151 , 000 . 00 and would go up to 180 , 000 . 00 a 29K bump . So , by the numbers alone , these guy ' s bids make sound economic sense . Plus , one ( Brown ) has was already governor once and the other ( Cuomo ) had a dad who was in the business , so there ' s that too ( I know , I know , lifelong politicians and all , but remember when devoting your life to public service when you could make a lot more money in the public sector was considered a good and noble thing ? ) .
