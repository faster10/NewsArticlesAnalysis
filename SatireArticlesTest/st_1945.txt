Financial numbers released along with director Koshinskin ' s statements show that the IRS is operating at previously unheard of operational financial deficits . The agencies cash reserves stand at 68 billion dollars . A paltry sum when compared to the 324 billion dollar refund burden estimated for the 2014 fiscal year . Koshinskin stated that normative cash reserves had been appropriated to fund several other federal programs , most notably the Affordable Care Act , and that the emergency appropriations had never been repaid into IRS coffers . This has left the IRS completely unable to meet its current financial obligations .
