A body a woman found in Philadelphia is not that of the missing pregnant woman , Latoyia Figueroa . Searchers breathed a sigh of relief at the news that the woman who has been missing for two weeks and has been the subject of candlelight vigils was not dead . The beautiful 24 year old has excited the imagination of the United States and has been the subject of reports by nearly every major print and television network . It is thought that the dead girl that was found is probably black or at least nowhere near as pretty as Ms . Figueroa or pregnant and therefore doesn ' t matter , at least not to White America .
