World leaders are shaking theirs heads in envy at the unprecedented amount of vacation time United States President George W . Bush has taken . Since Mr Bush took office he has spent nearly twenty percent of his presidency away from the Oval Office , or the Round Room as Mr Bush refers to it . Leaders of the world ' s other nations stand in amazement that while working only eighty percent of the time , President Bush has managed to physically destroy one country , economically destroy another and scare the crap out of every other one on the planet , all in the name of God and Freedom . Just think what he could have accomplished if he had worked full time .
