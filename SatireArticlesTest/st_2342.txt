ASPEN CO First , I must state the obvious . I didn ' t take too kindly to my assignment to cover The Annual The Phish High Times Marijuana Festival just outside of Aspen , Colorado . It ' s a hipster hotbed in a state allowing the consumption of evil marijuana . And when I say " consumption , " I don ' t mean medicinal dope . In Colorado , addicts are permitted to use dope recreationally for the sole purpose of blowing their already spent minds . The thought of having to trudge around and share a smelly fairgrounds with an un bathed mass of this sort filled me with scorn and resentment toward the man that sent me . But there was no choice . Allen Montgomery , the editor of TNReport , is so hard headed at times that I can ' t deal with him . His other possible choice for this painful assignment , my colleague , Miss Rayne Covelli , apparently was having some kind of confusing trouble with her female plumbing or other . She also experienced a serious ellis dee incident during a previous concert festival assignment and suffers still from what can be termed PTSD for civilians . Allen has a soft heart for complaining women voicing their displeasure about going through adversity . However , my experience reporting on The Phish concerts , having my car virtually destroyed while almost losing my life being forced to inhale nitrous oxide at knife point , zooms right over his head because I don ' t have a curvy body and wear perfume .
