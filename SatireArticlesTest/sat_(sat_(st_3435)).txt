Speaking on the condition of anonymity , Mr Waterhouse , a highly placed Unnamed former Bush Administration Source , said , " You know , I don ' t really give a rat ' s ass about whether or not Florida , Nevada , New Hampshire or Pago Pago is the first place to have a primary . And to be perfectly honest , it ' ll suck to be in New Hampshire shaking little babies hands and kissing young co eds in the middle of the goddamn Winter , but since my race is already starting from the back of the pack , stealing a little of Huntsman ' s thunder can ' t hurt . Plus , I try and stay away from cities that have casinos ever since that morning in 2003 when I woke up with twelve empty bottles of Cristal and a 250 pound stripper named Airtight Annie . "
