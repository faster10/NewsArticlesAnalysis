Strauss Kahn , who at 62 is the head of the International Monetary Fund , pleaded innocent on Monday to seven counts of sexual assault on a 32 year old maid at the Sofitel hotel in New York . Prior to his arrest , the married Strauss Kahn was favored to take over the French presidency from Nicolas Sarkozy , which has led some conspiracy theorists to suspect a setup . Strauss Kahn , they speculate , was trying to up his presidential bona fides by cheating on his wife with a woman 30 years his junior .
