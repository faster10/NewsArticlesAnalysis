According to Roman history , this campaign was successful , and the legions had to retreat because they were needed elsewhere . During that winter , the clans of northern Caledonia staged an uprising that threatened the Clyde Forth frontier . Agricola suspended his Irish campaign to deal with this new threat and the Roman military began a war of attrition . It took two years to defeat the Highlanders at the decisive battle of Mons Graupius . By this time Agricola had exceeded his term of office and was recalled to Rome by the Emperor Domitian . It now seems plausible that the Irish campaign could have in fact been abandoned after the lost of an entire cohort in battle against the locals .
