The discovery took place only 2 kilometers away from the " Roman fort " at Drumanagh , near Dublin . When that first site was discovered in 1996 , it led to some almost hysterical attempts by some leading Irish archaeologists to rubbish the claim , in support of the non invasion orthodoxy . Many of the soldiers from this new find could have indeed been associated with the fort , but most have been entirely stripped of their weapons and armor , complicating the confirmation process . To the archaeological team digging on the site , this is additional proof the Romans were indeed defeated in battle by local clansmen . The remains can still easily be identified as legionnaires , thanks to their distinctive Roman tunics , scarves and military boots .
