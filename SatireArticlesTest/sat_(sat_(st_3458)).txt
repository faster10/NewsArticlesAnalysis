It ' s nice to hear that George W . Bush grieves with you . It ' s also nice that he finally knows your son Casey ' s name I ' ll bet he won ' t forget it anytime soon either . After his initial days of silence hoping you ' d just go away , then his peoples threats to have you arrested if you didn ' t stop bullying the poor man and leave him alone , after making you crawl through ditches in the blistering heat and sit soaking in the rain , he was forced to acknowledge your presence . That ' s a loss for him right there , and one that I hope will cause him some grief as well .
