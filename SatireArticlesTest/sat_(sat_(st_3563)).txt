While the Dem . ' s are intentionally diverse , the Tea Party is just an umbrella , name for people to use , like ' Latino Voter ' like Latino ' s , there is no ' Tea Party ' bloc . The main thing they seem to agree on is no taxes , but none of them are suggesting they want any less services like garbage pick up , firemen and cops , Social Security or any of the federal entitlement money they qualify for , be it farm subsidies or new bridges . Look at Sarah Palin ' s Alaska the Queen of the Tea Party ' s state takes in a nearly 100 return on every tax dollar they send to Washington and charges the oil industry through the nose to work there . Let ' s see how far she ' d get trying to convince Alaskan ' s to give that up . It also has some of the highest property and business taxes , as well as sin taxes , in America and let ' s see the Tea People in the other forty nine states vote for that .
