CHICAGO , IL A second year pathology resident , Dr Daniel Platt , is being credited with discovering a new tumor following a presentation at his hospital ' s tumor board . " To be honest , I lost track of what I was talking about , " says Dr Platt . " I couldn ' t remember the name of the tumor I was describing , or if it was even a tumor to begin with . So I just started stringing together random pathology terms until everyone started nodding . "
