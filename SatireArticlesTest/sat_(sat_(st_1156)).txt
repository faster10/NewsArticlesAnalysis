" I was getting so tired of seeing posts of my friends working out on Facebook , " said 37 year old nurse Ted Pikes who is sporting a typical Dad bod . " I really started feeling guilty about my lack of physical activity after seeing all of these posts . " Pikes started talking to his other friends and found out that over 90 of his friends felt the same way that he did , but just didn ' t broadcast their lack of doing nothing . " That is when I felt like I had to do something to unite us unmotivated physical fitness guys who still wanted to post something , anything , on Facebook . "
