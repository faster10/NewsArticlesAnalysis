If that ' s not it , then please , God , pick another day . Or hey , pick no day . I really don ' t care , because being remembered for nothing is better than being remembered for being shot . And that ' s what it ' s all about . I ' ll prove it . You know what the lead story was on CNN about my " enduring legacy ? Not the space race or civil rights or the Cuban Missile Crisis or even the Bay of Pigs . It was about whether or not I was assassinated by a conspiracy . I ' ll tell you what the conspiracy is : you ' re all colluding to ruin my afterlife . Seriously , you people are sick .
