a ) Honestly , I think you need to break up with your partner . Then you need to learn how to represent curves that have symmetry about a point or spiral about a point .

If you break up with your partner they will never be able to hurt you again , and you can move on with learning about curves in polar coordinates . b ) Do it over text . When they least expect it . That hurts a lot , trust me . I mean , it ' s never happened to me , but I mean , yeah , it probably could drive someone insane . c ) 65
