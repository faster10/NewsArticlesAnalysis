Nurse Sandra immediately rushed to the room to find the patient sitting comfortably in his bed , holding out the full urinal . Upon seeing his saving grace , he ordered that his urinal be emptied . Nurse Sandra politely educated her patient that he could indeed walk , and probably do so well as to walk himself to the bathroom to empty his own urinal . Perhaps he may urinate in the restroom as well , if he feels up to it . Enraged , the patient began to scream , leading to a great number of nurses , doctors , and medical students to accumulate , stand and stare , and do nothing .
