Or maybe the big problem is that shutting down the net is benign . We give our presidents the power to destroy the world with atomic weapons , but doing so means , well , it ' s done and you can ' t undo it . In a way this is more dangerous because you can turn the net on and off according to your whim . And by extension , if you can shut the whole thing down it also means you can shut just certain parts of it down as well and just leave the parts you want running . And in a Democratic society , that ' s probably the most dangerous thing of all .
