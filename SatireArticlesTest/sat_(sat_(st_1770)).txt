The Baxter family has hired lawyers and hopes to thwart ICE from forcing the young boy on them . But that lawyer , Barbara Fitch , says the family is facing an uphill battle . " This is a tricky case , because technically , the Obama administration and ICE officials aren ' t actually breaking any laws here , " says Fitch . " The Third Amendment doesn ' t really apply here , because these aren ' t American citizens , and they aren ' t a military force . There ' s nothing in the law , at the State or Federal level , that prohibits ICE from forcing a well off American family into adopting an illegal with no legal guardian . "
