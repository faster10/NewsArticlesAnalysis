Shortly after Cruz ' impromptu press conference , his campaign manager ' s office revealed some additional details regarding the Senator ' s new Obamacare health insurance plan . " The Senator ' s new plan is approximately 18 . 5 cheaper than Mrs Cruz ' s Goldman Sachs insurance , as far as their premiums are concerned . He doesn ' t need to change any doctors his family will keep seeing the same healthcare professionals . And the coverage is better , too . His family ' s new policy offers better coverage than Mrs Cruz ' s former insurance , and it ' s a little bit better than the insurance offered to Senator Cruz through his Senate health insurance plan .
