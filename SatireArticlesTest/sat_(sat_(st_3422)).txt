The ceremony also served as a kickoff fundraiser for a Republican legal defense fund in anticipation of party leaders ' legal fees in connection with the unfolding Jack Abramoff scandal . While coffers have swelled with the return of millions in Abramoff ' s bribes , Republican party chairman Ken Mehlman stated he was fearful that funds would fall far short if the American public ' s awareness and outrage were to grow anymore . Mehlman expressed his congratulations to the pair and thanked Mr Rove for his ongoing efforts to suppress this awareness .
