I personally mostly still trust NPR , Reuters , and BBC , but that may just be because I want to trust something . Or maybe it ' s because I ' m a Liberal Democrat , a political leaning that NPR is regularly accused of being as well . But , given that viewpoint , I find that at least half the time I get pissed off at . not the way they present a story but at the questions they leave unasked in their interviews and from the letters they read from Conservatives the Right feels the same way , so I guess that ' s good . And increasingly I find myself reading stories from the venerable Atlantic Magazine .
