The one on one interviews consisted of an IM attending pimping an applicant for 2 minutes on aspects of the applicant ' s life . The attending would then interrupt with a sigh and walk away while loudly proclaiming the applicant ' s incompetence . A hidden camera in the room showed if the applicant started crying or showing any sign of a human emotion . If they did , they were rejected . If they reported the incident to the admissions director , they were referred for a psychiatric evaluation .
