The situation in Fallujah caught many Arab experts by surprise . Even Juan Cole , a Professor of History at the University of Michigan , and the man behind the influential web site Informed Comment had it wrong . " I ' m eating crow today . " Said Cole in a phone interview . " I figured we would have to level the place to get the insurgents out of there . I was betting on a major loss of life on both sides . Boy do I look like a jerk . I will never question George W . Bush ' s insight into the minds of Arabs again . "
