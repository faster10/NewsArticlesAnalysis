One guy , Santiago , who was Lorenzo ' s cousin , also worked for me . I didn ' t know it when it happened , because he didn ' t tell me , but one day he had stepped on a board with a nail sticking up and seriously punctured his foot . The next morning his foot was swollen , so he borrowed a larger shoe from someone , wrapped his foot and went to work . Three days later his foot was so seriously infected that he was forced to go to the hospital . Poor Pedro Nunez , hurt again . Santiago was there for a week on an IV antibiotic drip . He almost lost the foot . Luckily , through my phantom worker program , I was able to keep him on the payroll while he recuperated . The simple fact that I went to visit him a few times , swinging by for ten minutes on my lunch hour , nothing important , made me a sort of hero to a bunch of guys who lived in the shadows , expecting nothing in the way of caring or compassion from anyone but themselves .
