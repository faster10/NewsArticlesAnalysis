I wanted to start this letter with a more personal introduction , but no one here could remember if it was supposed be Dear Kim , Dear Jong or Dear Il . Boy , you Asian guys have a funny thing going with those backwards names . In fact , they tell me you all read everything backward , so I guess this letter won ' t make much sense to you unless you get some White guy or something to read it you later . Of course , this is also in English , so there ' s that problem as well . Say , do you want to hear some of the jokes we tell about you over here ?
