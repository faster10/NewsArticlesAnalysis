If anything clinches the case for suicide , according to Webb , it ' s that the odds of another democrat dying accidentally in a plane crash are infinitesimal . He cites in addition to Carnahan and Kennedy , for example : Rep . Jerry Litton of Missouri in 1976 , while campaigning for U . S . Senate nearly two months before the election ( exactly the same fate that befell Carnahan ) Rep . Hale Boggs of Louisiana , in 1972 , a member of the Warren Commission who expressed doubts about the commission ' s findings concerning JFK Rep . Larry McDonald , the national chairman of the John Birch Society linked to massive domestic spying and the CIA Rep . Larkin Smith in 1989 who was looking into the deaths of five Green Beret colonels connected to a covert CIA drug operation Commerce Secretary Ron Brown , another possible suicide , according to Webb , as photographs clearly show a bullet wound in the back of his skull Rep . Mickey Leland of Texas in 1989 and Rep . Nick Begich of Alaska in 1972 .
