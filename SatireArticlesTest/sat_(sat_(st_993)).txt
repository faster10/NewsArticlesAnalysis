Lacroix started to make changes . The Cafeteria was moved to the top floor to take advantage of the grand view of the parking lot . Large windows emphasize natural lighting and draw attention away from the signs demonstrating the Heimlich . White linen tables replaced cafeteria seating and seating capacity was reduced from three hundred to twenty eight . Printed paper menus are replaced with digitized ones , including a gorgeous iPad wine list . While certainly more upscale than its predecessor , one thing is certain : it is much more comfortable and inviting .
