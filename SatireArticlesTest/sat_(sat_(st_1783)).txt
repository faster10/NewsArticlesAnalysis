The Insane Clown Posse is the merging of two Detroit area rap thugs , 2 Violent on Dope and Shaggy Jay , who dress in ridiculous costumes with freakish black and white clown makeup . Their stage shows feature faked out bloody massacres and hedonistic sexual displays with each other and various animal props and mannequins of political and pop culture figures . Their antisocial lyrics and the psychotic shock value of their antics appeal to a wide range of misfits and wayward youth . The Insane Clown Posse has been under the radar watch of police and federal authorities for a number of years since their origin .
