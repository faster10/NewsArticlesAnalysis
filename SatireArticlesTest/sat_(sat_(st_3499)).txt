" We ' re getting a backlog of war stuff by Lockheed , Brown Root , Halliburton and other of our suppliers to the Defense Department . " Cheney said , " Congress doesn ' t want us to use these planes , bombs , tanks , ships and guns on Iran , so we got to use them somewhere . Turkey looks good . If we can ' t piss them off , how about China , or Mexico ? If I can continue to scoop up ' no bid ' contracts with the Defense Department , my Halliburton ' s stock price will continue to increase over the next few years , and as I will no longer be Vice President , I can exercise my stock options and be able to cash out for a substantial profit !
