But let ' s put our society and South Fulton , Tennessee ' s version of compassion and animal welfare aside and I like to believe that that episode was just an illustration Voltaire ' s comment about Admiral Byng , " in this country it is useful to kill an Admiral now and then , just to encourage the rest . " . Plus , it gave Glenn ( The Constitution Is Hanging By A Thread ! ) Beck , that devout Mormon evangelist , a couple days of good clean fun on his show mocking the family whose animals burned to death , so that ' s nice too . But I guess we should still examine the issue the issue of hidden campaign contributions by shadowy foreign governments and corporations , not South Fulton ' s burning animals to death or Glenn Beck ' s thinking it was funny . We ' ve covered that . People , please keep up .
