Ms . Berry , a Leo who house is in disrepair , should have heeded Dim Son ' s warning : " Your unfortunate attempt to master irony mutates into a full blown paradoxical reaction to life . Dandruff shampoo turns you into a blizzard with feet . Deodorant produces a rancid , road kill bouquet in your personal zones . Your performance in Catwoman is honored with a Razzie instead of an Oscar . Whatever you do , don ' t show up to accept the damn thing and for sure don ' t take your Oscar with you unless you truly want to look desperate . "
