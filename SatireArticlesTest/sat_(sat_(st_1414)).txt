" I was having a really rough week . I was holding the instruments wrong in the OR , cutting knots too short , then too long . I was a disaster and Winslow was furious . We get to rounds the next day , and to make up for the day prior , I quickly ran to gather all the vitals on all the patients . I wrote down all the ins , but guess what ? I forgot the outs . As soon as Dr Winslow realized my mistake , he threw down his papers , walked over to the desk and grabbed shears . He made me turn around and took two inches off the back of my coat in front of everyone . It was humiliating . "
