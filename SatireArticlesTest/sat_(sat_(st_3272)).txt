Lord , bro , that ' s brilliant ! Anyway , we ' ve stopped and we ' re about to start powering down the spacecraft . The noxious gases that formed from the friction of re entry are blowing away and the shuttle is cooling down . I have a checklist the size of the Panhandle to go through and Mission Control is going to have my nuts for breakfast if I don ' t tick every damn box . But guy , it has been great chatting . Hope your cold goes away soon I ' m serious about those LiquiCaps !
