It ' s an interesting position you ' re in . This thing , at this point at least , won ' t be over until you say it ' s over . and that ' s both the strength and the danger for you .

The fact that you were called to meet with George Bush just after Casey was killed and chose to be decorous at that meeting is being portrayed as you first supporting him , then , becoming one of the dreaded " flip floppers " ala ' John Kerry . Now you ' re someone with an " AGENDA " .
