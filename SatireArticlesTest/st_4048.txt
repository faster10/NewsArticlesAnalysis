The Dems in my congress have been beaten into submission , and now go along with everything I demand , and I am surprised that you object to my surrounding your pathetic country with troops , radar , anti missile things , putting spy satellites up in your stratosphere , and other innocent actions . We do this to protect you and our European allies from a dangerous threat from Iran and Syria , whom we predict may have nuclear equipped rockets capable of reaching targets here within the next seventy five years .
