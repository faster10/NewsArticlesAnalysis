You see , unlike many of you , GM has always respected who I am as a vehicle . Instead of focusing on my shortcomings , they made me feel good about myself . Instead of pointing out my genetic disability , they talked about my 5 speed transmission , my side curtain airbags , my great highway mileage , my economical pricing . Yes , they knew I had some " issues , " but they didn ' t publicly shame me by issuing a recall . Why not ? Because GM knew how you ' d react . They knew I would be ostracized . They knew I would be labeled " defective . " It ' s ironic , really . GM is in trouble for not protecting you from me , when the truth is , all along they ' ve been protecting me from you .
