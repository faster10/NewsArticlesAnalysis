Umphrey McGee is a progressive jamband that launches a three pronged pitchfork style frontal assault on the senses . They employ a mesh of rage filled guitar based structures at ear splitting volumes with tricky time changes and tempo shifts designed to facilitate the various levels of drug highs being experienced by band and crowd alike .
