Prison Chief Chavo Guerrero told the Mexico City Press , " This escape plot was even more calculated than his previous escape . It was very well planned . He pretty much just walked out of the prison undetected and have no idea where he is now . I think it was being planned and put in place while El Chapo was on the run several months ago , just in case he was captured and put back in the same prison . He ' s a smart man with plenty of resources . "
