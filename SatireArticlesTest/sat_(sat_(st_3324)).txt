War is an imperfect way of settling any dispute , because war itself is grossly imperfect . Yet for millennia humanity has chosen war over reasoned discourse . Some wars are aggressive , some defensive , some economic , some frivolous ( for me , religious and some ideological wars fall under this category ) , and a few are even the result of absolute boredom things have just gotten too comfortable , so let ' s find us an enemy . Yet some wars are also necessary . And in some wars , the reasons each side is fighting might be completely different .
