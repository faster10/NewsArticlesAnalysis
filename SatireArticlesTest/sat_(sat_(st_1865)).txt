In another unlawful killing he witnessed , one of his other partners was briefly suspended without pay when he killed a 15 year old black child less than a minute after arriving on scene . Grayson and that partner had gotten a call from a " concerned citizen " as the police report would say , and they arrived to find a young teenager walking toward a McDonald ' s restaurant . According to the report , the teenager failed to stop when asked by Grayson ' s partner where he was going , and then he " gave a menacing look to the officer " the report said , " and the officer felt compelled to fire four rounds into the suspect ' s body to subdue them , for fear of being overtaken and killed . " Investigators would later find out the boy was going to work at the McDonald ' s and couldn ' t hear Grayson ' s partner with his headphones on , though the officer involved in that shooting again was exonerated because in the words of the report , " he felt kind of nervous about how the distracted black teenager looked at him for a couple of brief seconds .
