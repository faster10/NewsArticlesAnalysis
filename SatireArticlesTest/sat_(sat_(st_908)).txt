" I was sucking on the last fentanyl patch , doubting the spring ever existed and certain I would die on that mountain when I saw the steam . I knew I was hallucinating , but Pink Floyd ' s ' Comfortably Numb ' became louder with each step as I neared the pond . I have no idea how long I spent up there on that first trip , or even how many times I have hiked up . This is my new home it is heaven on Earth . "
