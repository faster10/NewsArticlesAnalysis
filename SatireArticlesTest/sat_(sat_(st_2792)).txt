" We were just all sitting there because grandpa said he wanted to tell us something really important " , said Genevieve Phelps . Genevieve , along with several of her aunts and uncles sat huddled around the dying old man to hear him out . " He just looked at us all and smiled and said , I ' m sorry . I ' m gay . Our jaws just dropped , I mean It doesn ' t make any sense . We ' re all just praying that this is somehow related to his illness or the medication he ' s on . He ' s really delirious and half the time he ' s not making any sense at all . Regardless , it was very hard to hear after he spent his entire life fighting the scourge of homosexuality in the name of the Lord our God . "
