Drug seekers everywhere in Philadelphia have been utilizing this service , sometimes at 4 to 5 to a vehicle . Previously , seekers had been reliant on calling 911 for ambulances from the hospital waiting room , having enablers among their friends , and occasionally engaging in the act of walking on foot to the next ED , sometimes for several miles , only to suddenly be unable to walk the moment they hit the door . In fact , drug seekers have expressed a level of enthusiasm over the service not seen since Oxycontin was discovered to be snortable .
