" I just don ' t know how many more times I can go to neighborhood bar Ralphie ' s , where they donate their tips to the Red Cross , " grunted Joel Pullman , 28 , developer , as he wearily lifted his fourth beer to his lips to support the relief effort . " I really want to help , but I don ' t know how much longer I can hold out here . When my friend Josh who tends bar told me that they would be donating all their tips and half the profits to the Red Cross , I eagerly came down after work that night and drank my way to at least 30 in donations to those in need . After five nights , I think I might have to call off my own personal relief effort . "
