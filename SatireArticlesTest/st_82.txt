" I noticed an object that looked like a metal cylinder , which I thought was an oil barrel " says Jason Sutter . " When I dug it up a bit , I noticed that it was actually a lot bigger and that there was some writing on the side . When I saw the inscription saying that it was a Mk 15 nuclear bomb , I totally freaked out . I caught Chritina by the arm and made signs to tell her we had to leave . We made an emergency ascent , went back to shore and then we called 911 . "
