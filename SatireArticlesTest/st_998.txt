The bizarre turn of events started a little less than halfway through McSwagger ' s 12 hour shift , when he began having severe abdominal pain . McSwagger stated , " At first it was just generalized pain . I figured it was just a bit of indigestion from the cafeteria chili dog I scarfed down in two bites while I was intubating that patient in the elevator , but then my abdomen blew up like a beach ball , and the pain settled in my right lower quadrant just at McBurney ' s point . I knew I had a hot appendix , but what to do ? There were still 7 hours left in my shift . I walked down to the ED and they took one look at me and threw me in room 8 . The ED attending , Dr Sandy Beaches , did a quick assessment . She agreed wholeheartedly with my initial assessment and left to page the surgeon on call . "
