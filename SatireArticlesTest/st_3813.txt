You find that working for the common good is well , good . And not just your own family either when I was poor I had neighbors who helped me build my roof , install my plumbing , loaned me tools and equipment , and just outright give me shit they had that I needed and they didn ' t . Even the woman who held my mortgage waited more times than I care to remember for her monthly check . My mom of course helped too I may be estranged from my own family now after her death , but when they let me down and I was sick to the point of nearly dying , I had neighbors , some poorer than I , who helped keep me alive . They brought me loads of firewood to heat my house , plowed my driveway you know , stuff they didn ' t have to do but did anyway . It made them feel good and I know I was grateful beyond words , even if it did dismantle my pride a bit .
