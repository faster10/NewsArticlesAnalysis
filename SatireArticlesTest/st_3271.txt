Many residents of Forest Grove have a personal connection to Ms . Codbone . For instance , one day last October , my son Darren became lost in the middle of the Deep Dark Forest on the way to his first day of kindergarten . Luckily , Ms . Codbone was close by for some reason and found him . She gave him a ride to school , but not before conjuring up one of her famous chocolate chip cookies out of thin air . I never got to ask her how she did that .
