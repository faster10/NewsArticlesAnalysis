" This country cannot afford to have anyone but the NFL rushing yards leader in the White House , " Fiorina said , " and luckily for America , I ' m that person . Yes . Me . I ' m the person . So , just go ahead and vote for me next fall , and you can rest assured you ' ll get nothing but the most honest , forthright leadership you could hope for . God Bless us all , but mostly me , for all my tremendous abilities . "
