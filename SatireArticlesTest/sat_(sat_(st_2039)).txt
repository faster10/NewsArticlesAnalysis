In the letter , Dennis writes " It wasn ' t until 6 months ago that the workplace harassment began . A new department manager , Jack Phillips , was brought on board after our previous manager had retired . From day one I could tell Phillips didn ' t like me . I wasn ' t sure if I had unknowingly offended him or why he treated me so much more poorly then all of the other employees in our department . He was always making condescending remarks towards me and the harassment only continued to get worse and worse . "
