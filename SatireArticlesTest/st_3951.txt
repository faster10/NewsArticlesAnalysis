But , as I said , the DC cops cared . A lot . I think every one of them was on the street that night and each one seemed to give me a hard stare as I passed by in my car . It made me wish I didn ' t have a hundred black beauties in a baggie under my passenger seat , let me tell you . And I still didn ' t know what was up . I didn ' t find out till I hit my friend ' s dorm what had happened .
