The staffers , one of whom is a senior aide to the First Lady , claim Michelle Obama made " about a dozen " Vine videos , before deciding the " turnip , for what ? " video was the best . The eleventh video she made featured the First Lady asking " Rice , right ? " before throwing a bunch of rice at the camera . But in the twelfth and final video they made , Obama held up a beet in one hand , and a clear plastic bag of rice in the other , and said " Make the connection ? Ouch , bad pun , " before laughing and asking for the camera to be cut .
