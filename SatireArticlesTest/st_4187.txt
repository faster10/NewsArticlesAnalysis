Republicans say people will game the system and go to a doctor every time they sneeze if they had healthcare . Maybe some would there are always a few . Rich people game the system all time too . But those people are already gaming the system by using emergency rooms and stuff at an enormous cost to everyone . If someone had an affordable health plan with say , a 75 . 00 dollar ER co pay , they ' d probably wait to make a 35 . 00 doctor ' s appointment unless it really wasan emergency , saving the system perhaps a grand a pop . ER visits are pricey .
