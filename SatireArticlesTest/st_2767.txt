While O ' Hara speculates that Vin may play more fair with his other characters , role player Edwin Levell of Glendale , CA disagrees . " I ' ve played in a few games with Vin Diesel where he used ' Walrill ' , his thief character . It was pretty annoying . Vin used ' Walrill ' to steal pretty much everything that wasn ' t locked down in the game . He even started pickpocketing the other members of the group . He was getting these insane dice rolls the likes of which I ' ve never seen and it really disrupted the game . "
