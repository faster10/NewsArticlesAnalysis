The Administration of George W . Bush has decided to allow the CIA to send terror suspects overseas for interrogation in countries whose rules on torture are more lax than ours such as Egypt , Saudi Arabia and the Duchy of Monaco . The process of shipping American detainees to other countries to be physically beaten and mentally slapped about is known by the somewhat innocuous term , " Rendition " . Officials are adamant in their denial that prisoners have been subjected to actual torture , but with Alberto Gonzales as America ' s Attorney General , few have any real idea what exactly the Administrations concept of torture actually is . Stories have emerged of intense psychological torture , such as interrogators playing Michael Jackson ' s Thriller and anything by Britney Spears at top volume or the entire first season of The Apprentice back to back . If true , the allegations would certainly be actionable in the World Court as cruel and unusual .
