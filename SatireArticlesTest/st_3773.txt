Benny Hinn who looks like a sleazy used car salesman with a strange accent , has an interesting way to impress his TV viewers and rake in the money . Called up , during his program , are people with incurable diseases , and other maladies . Hinn pops them on the head , calls in a loud , threatening voice " Jesus , make this blind man see " , and as the music rises , and the choir sings , the man dramatically throws his dark glasses in the air , shouting , " Thank you dear brother Hinn , I CAN SEE AGAIN " ! and gosh ! It brings in big bucks !
