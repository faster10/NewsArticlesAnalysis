Thursday ' s incident at New York ' s Waldorf Astoria began when Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates ( 86 kilos ) unexpectedly walked across the stage and charged AOL Time Warner ' s incoming chief executive Richard Parsons ( 90 kilos ) . Gates was intercepted by Parson ' s entourage , which included U . N . Secretary General Koffi Annan ( 68 kilos ) and United Airlines Chairman Niall Fitzgerald ( 80 kilos ) . During the five minute scuffle , Gates allegedly bit Parsons on the thigh , while World Bank President James Wolfensohn ( 92 kilos ) suffered a bloody lip . Wolfensohn also claimed 50 million was missing from his wallet , and immediately blamed Argentine President Eduardo Duhalde ( 80 kilos ) .
