" I was in pain , but it seems like I always feel worse than at least half the patients I ' m admitting , so I didn ' t think much about answering it . I was shocked to hear the voice of Dr Beaches on the other end of the line . Sandy was a little difficult to understand , partially because I could hear her voice at the workstation right outside my door and then again on my cellphone , and partially because of the Dilaudid they were giving me , but I got the gist . She said , ' I ' ve got one for you . 36 year old man with no significant past medical history . Comes in with a hot appendix , surgery says to admit them to medicine and they ' ll consult . ' I marveled at the irony of the situation , I mean here I was with appendicitis , and there ' s another guy my exact age who also needed to be admitted for appendicitis . I asked for the patient ' s location , and Sandy shot back with room 8 . "
