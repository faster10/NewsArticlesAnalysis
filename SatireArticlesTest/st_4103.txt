I don ' t usually address local or statewide issues on this site , but indulge me if you will for a moment . I live , as I ' ve said many times before in Syracuse , New York . I am also , unfortunately , still a smoker . Patches , hypnosis , Wellbutrin , acupuncture , cold turkey doesn ' t matter , I can ' t shake it . I know a guy who was a heroin addict for over twenty years and he ' s been clean for a decade at least , yet he still can ' t quit smoking . Just too hard . Be that as it may , I still buy cigarettes being by necessity thrifty , I go to the local Indian reservation to buy them . Now , this piece is not about cigarettes per se , it ' s about Tribal Sovereignty .
