The Manti that I knew in all but the corporeal sense was kind , giving and loyal . Intensely loyal . Doesn ' t that count for anything nowadays ? This man stuck with the me he said I was . For instance , when I was sick and dying from cancer , he didn ' t turn away . He kept up our relationship until my last fictional breath . Manti said that my last words to him were , " I love you . " Think about that . If he did this for the publicity , my last words to him would have been , " You ' re the best player in college football , " or " My dying wish is for a purely defensive player to win the Heisman for the first time in history . " But that ' s not what he said I said . Instead he said I said , " I love you . "
