WASHINGTON , D . C . Politico reported this week that the campaigns for several of the Republican presidential contenders are planning to meet separately from the Republican National Committee to discuss how they can wrest control over the format and questions of the next debate . The meeting comes as a result of nearly every campaign having multiple complaints about the debate held on CNBC earlier in the week . Many complained that the questions asked by the moderators weren ' t substantive enough , however some Republican aides speaking on the condition of anonymity and an Amazon gift card told reporters that the majority of the candidates were most angry that they were asked tough questions at all .
