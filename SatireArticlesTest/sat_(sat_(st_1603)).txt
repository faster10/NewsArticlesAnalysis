" We were clearing the field , " according to maintenance worker Bret Hanover , when I heard all this commotion . This little guy was yelling and screaming about how he wasn ' t a jockey , and take your hands off me , don ' t you know who I am ? ' That kinda thing . So I look over and the guy who ' s doing all the yelling ? Turns out it ' s the sports guy the little one on TV Bob Costas . He was kicking and screaming and security had to lead him away . They picked him up by the elbows and his little legs were flailing all over the place like in the cartoons , that kinda thing . "
