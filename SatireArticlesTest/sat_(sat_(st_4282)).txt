And this is where Juan Williams got it wrong he didn ' t analyze , he opined . Now , opinion is quite acceptable on FOX in fact they prefer it over truth but the thing about NPR that both drives me crazy and keeps me listening is that they don ' t allow say , Dina Temple Raston to opine . Quite honestly , sometimes I wish they would , as in , " The Tea Party said this today , but they couldn ' t be more wrong . The dopes . "
