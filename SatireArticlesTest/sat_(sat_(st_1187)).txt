There is nothing wrong with avoidance or running away , as you long as you ' re okay forever being known as a spineless human . Call in sick , say that you tripped , falling forward , leading you to accidentally suck on the filthy doorknob of a public bathroom and are subsequently symptomatic . Better to have someone else deal with your mess , right ? " What if I ' m already in the hospital ? you ask . Simple : call out sick . Just say you tripped , fell forward , accidentally sucking on the MRSA infested doorknob of the office bathroom instead .
