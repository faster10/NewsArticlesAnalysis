Since his election by papal council in March of 2013 , the Pope ' s revolutionary stance on several issues has both energized and alienated members of the church in ways that have inspired a new generation of Catholics , while distancing more conservative members of the faith . Some view the pontiff ' s comments as a purely political statement rather than a personal call to arms , while others applaud the decision , recalling the controversy over the 1991 film The Pope Must Die . The title was subsequently changed to The Pope Must Diet .
