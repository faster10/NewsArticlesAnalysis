Despite increasingly desperate pleas from GOP party stalwarts , Arizona Senator John McCain is still refusing to dump his running mate , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin . McCain told ABC ' s " this Week " , They ( the sane wing of the Republican Party ) can complain . I ' ll rely on the American people . After all , they were stupid enough to elect George W . Bush for two terms , and he knew even less than Sarah about foreign policy . Not to mention that She ' s brought a kind of excitement that makes you think that campaigns can be an exciting trip . ( someone ' s tripping , that seems obvious ) Anyway , she can pronounce Ama . . Ahmidin that Iranian guy ' s name better than me . "
