Back on the family front , Kim ' s sources deny any jealousy or competition for ratings or attention . " Kim is so proud of Caitlyn " , said a spokesperson , adding " the only problem Kim is wrestling with now is whether to follow Kardashian family tradition and spell ' Caitlyn ' with a ' K ' rather than with a ' C ! ' We ' re all holding our breath in suspense just waiting to find out if there they ' ll have another little K or another little C ! "
