" I ' ve been to France many times . It ' s a beautiful country , I love it there . France is very nice . You know what ' s not nice ? The American media . They keep referring to your terrorist attack as ' nice . ' They say ' oh , breaking news , there was a ' nice ' terrorist attack over in France . ' And I ' m like , is that really how you want to refer to these terrorists ? You want to say they ' re nice people ? They ' re not nice people . They ' re very , very bad people . And the attack itself wasn ' t nice either . Terror is never ' nice , ' okay ? "
