Good morning , Dr Sri Sheshadariprativadibayankaram . Thanks for taking a moment out of your busy hospitalist day to stop by my office as I had requested . Have a seat . Yes , that ' s a gold plated chair , thanks ! I used some of last year ' s bonus to import this from Burma . Now , I ' ve been reviewing the data I ' ve been compiling about you , and it ' s evident to hospital administration that you ' re not being a team player . We need you to follow our commands about what you need to do first everyday . Let me make things clear to you so you can organize your priorities the right way .
