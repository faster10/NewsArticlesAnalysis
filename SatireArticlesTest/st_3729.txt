" Elephants never forget , " stated aging Disney icon , and former Republican mascot Dumbo . The lovable , and traditionally silent cartoon elephant appeared embittered and eager to speak out after he was contacted for a quote . " My mom finally died a few years back , and she was destitute . She was chronically ill , and the Republican Party actively fought every attempt to introduce universal health care , which could have saved her life . To add insult to injury , she was not allowed to die with dignity , either , as our family plot in the traditional elephant dying grounds in Africa has been clear cut thanks to economic globalization under the Bush Administration .
