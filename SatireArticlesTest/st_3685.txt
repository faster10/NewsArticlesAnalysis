Look , it ' s not that religion is inherently bad I mean , there ' s some good advice in the Ten Commandments and probably some other places in the Bible , Torah , Koran and holy books of every other faith . It ' s religious people that are pretty weird and the orthodox ones of any religion are the weirdest and most dangerous of all . Forget politics , money , land or even food and water religious people start more wars , kill more people , cause more misery and trample on the rights of others far more than anyone or anything else . Been that way for millennia and shows no sign of stopping . So , for the record my position is this : the mosque community center both should be allowed to be built and the guys who want to build it shouldn ' t not because it ' s a mosque , but because until humanity can get away from religion entirely , we ' ll never have peace .
