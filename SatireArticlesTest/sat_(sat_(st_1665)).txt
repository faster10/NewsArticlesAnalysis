Many fans of the show have claimed over the troubled November and December run of the series to have seen the cancellation coming . " First you dump the show on Sundays so it ' s always starting late or not airing at all because of football , " explained CSI fan Kent Morgan on a public post from late October on the show ' s official Facebook page . " Then you guys cut it to 18 episodes . We ' re not dumb . If you ' re going to cancel it , at least give your fans the decency to say something about this being the final season . Jerking us around like this is not cool . "
