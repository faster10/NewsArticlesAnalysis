" I ' m in favor of the drug war even though I ' m an admitted former drug addict , " Limbaugh said , " and I ' ve even come out in favor of drug testing welfare recipients . I ' m a firm believer in Trickle Down economics , and if ever there was an example of simplistic , unevolved thinking , it ' s Tricke Down . I ' ve had almost as many failed marriages as Donald Trump has had failed business ventures , and yet I think it ' s gays that ruin the sanctity of marriage . Nearly every opinion I have is from a bygone era and built around largely debunked social myths and stereotypes . So yeah , I ' d say I ' m as good an argument against evolution as any , wouldn ' t you ? "
