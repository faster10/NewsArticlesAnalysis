Grass was never one much for imagining . Seventeen years of soil and solitude didn ' t lend themselves to fantasizing , to " What ifs ? " Patience was the key . Forbearance was the watchword . So it was no surprise , certainly not to Grass , that he named himself for the very first thing he came across when he clambered , at long last , from his lair . He did not think or wish or daydream as he climbed . He did not romanticize or visualize as he clung , like a mantis to its prey , and waited for instinct to take over , for his carapace to crack , for his body to thrust itself out , bit by bit , into the world above . Instead , it is now , only now , finally now , as his wings spread and his antennae shiver and the dew of 17 summers lifts from his eyes , that Grass allows himself to be surprised . Because a bird has eaten him .
