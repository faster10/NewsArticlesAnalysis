Here at Outside Hospital ( OSH ) , we are 100 committed to your satisfaction as a patient . To this end , we have created this pamphlet , which contains some tips and advice to guide you in your hospital stay , and we will be providing this to each and every patient immediately upon your arrival to the hospital . Even if you have slurred speech secondary to a stroke , been shot multiple times , or don ' t even know your own name , don ' t worry , we won ' t bother you with pesky EKG ' s or mental status exams until we have gone over this information , in detail .
