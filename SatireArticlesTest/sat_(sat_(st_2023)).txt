PYONGYANG North Korea Kim Jong Un , the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea , has reportedly issued a bizarre edict effecting over 90 of North Korean adult men . Substantiated reports reveal that all males above the age of 21 are to have their penises cut to a length shorter than that of Un ' s reported 7 . 1 centimeters ( 2 . 8 inches ) . The goal is to make Un the most endowed male figure in all of North Korea .
