The carbon dating of the new ship estimates that it dates from between 990 and 1050 AD , approximately the period associated with Vinland and the various Canadian sites ( L ' Anse aux Meadows , Tantfield Valley , Avayalik Islands ) . This could mean that the that the Viking had actually developed a far wider trade network in the Americas that what was traditionnally believed . Unfortunately , very few other artefacts have yet been found on the site , suggesting the crew must have most likely abandoned the ship and continued on foot .
