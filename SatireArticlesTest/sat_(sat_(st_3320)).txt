It was so strange . The first thing we saw , and I ' m not kidding here , was three people who had just come in through the main doors next to the electronic store . One was a rather large and sweaty example of feminine pulchritude the others were two teenage guys , maybe her sons . They were kind of punky in their dress army boots and ripped tee shirts that said things like " Kill Yourselves While You ' ve Got The Chance " and " Death is the best part of Life " on them . The odd thing was that one of them was bleeding fairly heavily from his ears , as if he had a concussion . He was a bit glassy eyed but talking and laughing normally with the other two , who ignored his obvious wounds completely . They were trying to figure out where to get something to eat . I wanted to break into the conversation and suggest that the Hospital Cafeteria might be a good place , but my wife grabbed my arm and gently shook her head no . After all , this is America , so weapons may have started coming out if we bothered them too much .
