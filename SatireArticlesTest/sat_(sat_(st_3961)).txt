As to Mr Rove ' s future professional plans , he had this to say : " I ' m probably going to be even busier in resignation than when I was in the West Wing . As I said , I ' ll be supervising very closely my son ' s college career . In addition I ' ll be maintaining contact daily via Blackberry with the president . I will also likely leave the country briefly over the next six months in order to do some preliminary work for the establishment of the South American White House in Paraguay prior to Mr Bush ' s arrival presumably sometime around the first of the year in 2009 . Look for Alberto Gonzales to accompany me later as we attempt to iron out some of the sticking points between the two governments legal systems in regards to extradition . "
