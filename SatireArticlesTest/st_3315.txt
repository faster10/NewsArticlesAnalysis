I know very few people actually like or trust the United Nations , but it would have to be a world body along those lines that would administer these areas . Or I could do it I ' m looking for work right now and I ' m a Libra , so you know I ' ll be fair . And I wouldn ' t ask for much a couple mil a year , like ten or twelve , tax free , would be fine . And a jet I ' d need to get around easily . Oh , oh , and a house , a really nice one , in each place too . Not a palace or anything , but not less than twenty rooms with a fenced in backyard to run the dogs . And wi fi with Hulu , that ' s very important too .
