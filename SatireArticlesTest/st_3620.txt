Tennessee Senator and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist , apparently remembering that he used to be a doctor and had taken an oath to ' do no harm ' , has parted ways with United States President George W . Bush who made no such promise , on the issue of stem cell research . Mr Frist , who ' s careful scrutiny of a videotape resulted in the misdiagnoses earlier this year of that brain dead woman in Florida , what ' s her name , has apparently been slowly regaining his sanity since that incident . Mr Bush , incensed at Mr Frist ' s defection has used his power to make recess appointments to make John Bolton United States Ambassador to the United Nations in retaliation .
