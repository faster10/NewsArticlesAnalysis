As if that ' s not enough , President Bush is calling on schools to teach competing theories to Evolution , such as Intelligent Design ( ID ) and Pagan Black Magic . The Evangelical President has said that the wonders of the universe just can ' t be explained without inserting a Creator into the picture . Proponents of ID , or IDiots as they refer to themselves , reject the concept that living creatures may have been made by God to be capable of adaptation , as adapting to a changing situation goes against everything they believe in . Personally , I ' d hate to think God is responsible for George W . . Bush and the Evangelical Christian Movement I mean , if George Bush is made in the image of God , then what hope do any of us really have in this life or the next ?
