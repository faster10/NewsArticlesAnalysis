Key hospital administrators along with the current Board of Trustees predict improvements on multiple levels . According to hospital CFO Sharon Houseman , the hospital spends in excess of 1 . 2 million annually on food service for patients , staff , and guests and only recovers approximately 200 , 000 each year . Cutting the food service department will net an additional one million dollars annually which can be spent on administrators ' cost of living increases and reward bonuses . And , because NCCMC will be a food free facility , it is estimated that key personnel will only work half days thereby reducing office space and non productive meetings . Unused offices will be renovated into more bed space for customers and a state of the art all inclusive spa for hospital administrators .
