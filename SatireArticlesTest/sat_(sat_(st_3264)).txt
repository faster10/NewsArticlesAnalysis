Do not ask your father how he feels about your future ex husband . Get married in either an orchard or a rose garden : a place that screams , " Where we ' re going , we don ' t need vases . " Your engagement ring should be upsettingly large and annoy your friends , who will feign happiness . Definitely have kids with your future ex husband . Have one or two . You won ' t have a pre nup , because he ' s afraid of you .
