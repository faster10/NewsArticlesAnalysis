Reportedly , one concern that Ryan still has is who will take over the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee . The congressional group holds many of the purse strings and it was a long coveted role in government for Ryan , who technically as a Republican hates government itself . However , many of those concerns were allayed when the ghost of Ayn Rand agreed to takeover the post . Ryan reportedly is " pleased as punch that the ghost of the sociopathic , shitty fiction writer that most influenced his economic vision , " agreed to relieve him of his post on the committee according to one of his aides .
