" If I wanted her to write me a letter , I ' d have bought her a typewriter , not a cell phone with free anytime minutes , " said boyfriend Ronald Yvers , substitute science teacher at Bay Harbor Elementary . " This ' I can ' t wait to see you tonight and kiss you , my sweet sweet love ' stuff should really come to an end . A nice little ' luv u cant w8 to c u 2nite ' gets the message across just fine and in less than half the time . She could even put a smiling emoticon in to let me know that she was happy when she wrote it . "
