" He invited me over to his apartment the other night to watch a movie . . . on VHS , " he said , shaking his head . " Tape , for Christ ' s sake . Even if I wanted to do that , I ' m sure I wouldn ' t be able to see the screen through all the fuzz , not to mention not being able to hear a damn thing because you can ' t get true 5 . 1 Surround Sound out of it . . . not that Peter has the speaker set up for that , of course . "
