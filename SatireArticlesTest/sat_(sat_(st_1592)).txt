" Pennies make nickels , nickels make dimes , dimes make quarters , well , actually two dimes and a nickel make a quarter , and so do five nickels for that matter , and of course if you have enough pennies , and that ' s a big ' if ' for average , hard working people , then of course you can also make a quarter from those pennies which will eventually add up to a dollar , which is part of our new strategy . So at the end of the day all of these things add up to help defeat the corporate structure on Wall Street that controls our elections , which Secretary Clinton is a big , big , part of by the way .
