' Special ' . Lady , this is California in 2010 do you have any idea how many ' special ' houses are up for sale ? There ' s at least fifty in this community alone and anyway , ' special ' just means that you customized your house to the point where only a very small subset of buyers will even want to look at it . These guys have attached a forty foot long , thirteen foot high garage to it for their own RV , a very salable commodity if you have a school bus or want an indoor basketball court .
