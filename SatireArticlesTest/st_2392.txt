Din and ridicule rose from the audience in disfavor of the comment , but President Obama offered this explanation , " Let me clarify . The United States ' most valuable asset is its people . Since the founding of this nation white privilege Christianity has had the greatest influence over Washington . It has dominated every corner of our society , in the workforce , the military , with new legislation and policies , and it ' s found at every level of government from the White House to City Hall . Anytime the government or a corporation or small business reduces that pool of assets by separating people by race , religion , political affiliation , or gender and elevates a specific class of people above others it reduces prospects for those looking for opportunities and diminishes the opportunity for government or business to hire the best candidate .
