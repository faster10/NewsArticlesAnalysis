Of course , religion is just a part of it , only half , if the poll numbers are correct . Another big part is all these Hispanic persons . It ' s a dichotomy on the face of it , cause most Hispanics are Christian . But first , they ' re usually Catholic Christians ( and even I know from bitter experience that that ' s a weird religion ) which makes hating them okay and second , they well , let ' s face it they look really Spanish . They have accents and listen to music with accordions in it . They even have a different written language , for god ' s sake .
