During her speech , Ms . Palin also blamed Environmentalists for the BP oil spill , citing the fact that if they hadn ' t made oil rig workers so nervous with their anti drilling signs and stuff , the accident probably never would ' ve happened . She also pointed out that ANWAR ( The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ) has no Gulf of Mexico in it and therefore fishermen could practice their trading of shrimp in peace , since any oil that spilled there would be quickly noticed on the snow and could be easily sopped up with rags and paper towels before things got out of hand .
