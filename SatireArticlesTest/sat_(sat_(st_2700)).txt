Jasper isn ' t seeking rape or incest exceptions for every woman regardless of her situation . Instead , he says he thinks " only women who we know didn ' t provoke their attack " should be given the chance to abort their pregnancy . Jasper says that in his experience " even though a woman may have no interest in sex , she may give certain cues to men like being female and around a man , for example that give him the impression she ' d at least be up for some hand and mouth stuff , and usually more .
