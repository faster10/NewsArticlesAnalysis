" Oh man . Woooo . Anyways , starting in 2014 , the NRMP algorithms will auto flag any last names which have a high PP potential pun score . Then , our newly formed PP committee will review the case carefully , looking for short term as well as long term ramifications . If , for example , Dr Hu intends to do a neurology residency , that will not be a problem for anyone as long as the doctor doesn ' t mind all the tardive dyskinesia jokes , haha But if Dr Hu has expressed plans to later specialize in Alzheimer ' s disease , the committee will need to take preemptive action .
