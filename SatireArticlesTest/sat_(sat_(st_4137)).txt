The ice saga begins with Bush appointing a crony , 2000 campaign manager and Texas chief of staff , Joe Allbaugh , to head FEMA . Allbaugh brought a school chum , Michael Brown , along with him and recommended Brown to replace him when Allabaugh left to form his own consulting firm to " take advantage of business opportunities in the Middle East " following the Iraq war . Brown ' s experience included a failed Congressional bid , where he drew 27 percent of the vote , and a stint at enforcing rules for the Arabian Horse Association .
