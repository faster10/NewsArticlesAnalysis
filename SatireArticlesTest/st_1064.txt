Ginger actually even seemed to understand what the ancillary services needed to do . Rooms were turned over in record time . Meals always arrived hot . PT and OT were ordered early in the hospitalization . No one even objected when the first cyborgs showed up . They were easy to spot because they had rubber skin . They started doing lots of little things turning patients , meeting with the Joint Commission , cleaning the windows in the lobby . Then , one day , a newer model cyborg with organic skin started showing up . Only the therapy dogs could tell the difference between them and humans .
