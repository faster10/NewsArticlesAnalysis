I ' m also not too concerned about Iraq and military matters either . Remember , it was Democrats , Kennedy and Johnson who escalated the Vietnam War and a Republican , Nixon , who lost it . And it was Democrats , Wilson and Roosevelt , who won World Wars I and II . Democrats can be surprising when it comes to fighting a war . Forget about the Republican Lincoln and the Civil War the positions on every issue between Democrats and Republicans in 1860 were completely reversed and if he were alive today , Lincoln would be a Democrat .
