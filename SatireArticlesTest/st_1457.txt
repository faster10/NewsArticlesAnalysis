" There was no compassion for me in the ED there , " said Applewood . " I asked for some water and it took the nurses 6 minutes to bring me a glass . They used staples on my head instead of taking their time to suture me up . They don ' t even care about the scar this will leave me ! They even cut my pants off to fit a plain white cast on my leg . I loved those pants and they didn ' t even ask me if they could cut them off . "
