One night not too long after , Lorenzo invited me to their apartment for dinner . Since I was away from my wife and home all week myself , I had no problem going it was nice to have something to do . I got there to find they had a rickety old video camera set up facing a blank wall with a Guatemalan flag tacked to it . After dinner ( I hate black beans , but what can you do ? ) they took turns talking to the camera , making little speeches that I couldn ' t understand , but did recognize my name every now and then . Then Lorenzo asked me to get up and speak , explaining that the village priest spoke English and would translate . It turned out that the evening was a tribute to my helping them as their Jefe ' , or boss . They wanted their families to see me . They presented me with a Levi ' s work shirt as a gift , costing at least thirty dollars , a large sum for them . Then they gave me a cake . A cake . I have never felt so honored or proud never . At the end of the evening I asked if I could keep the flag , which seemed to please them all out of proportion to the request . It sits over my desk as I write this .
