Nestl broke ground on what they call the " Nestl Air " plant , a 2 . 4 billion facility , in October of 2013 , but water shortages led State legislators to insist the plant hold off on opening until March 1st of 2016 . California Governor Jerry Brown signed an order last month which fast tracked the new plant ' s opening , guaranteeing Nestl the State of California would " clear out the red tape " and allow the plant to open before January 1st of 2017 .
