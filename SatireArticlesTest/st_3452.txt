The exhibit in Beijing pays tribute and a debt of thanks to the man and his theories . It explores Karlbert Rovestein ' s life from birth to ironic death in a Jewish concentration camp in Germany in 1944 . Historians point out that the postcards that he sold for his Austrian starving artist neighbor may very likely have been those of a young Adolph Hitler . Researchers point out that Hitler made numerous references in letters and papers to an old Jewish neighbor who helped him by selling his post cards . The neighbor is often referred to as " schisse bluete " in letters and papers , and most historians agree that this was about the time in Hitler ' s life that his anti Semitism began . Rovestein ' s death becomes ironic when one appreciates that it was at the hands of a Nazi political system created by Hitler , Goebbels , and Himmler which embraced Rovestein ' s theories .
