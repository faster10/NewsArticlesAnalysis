Dora the Malingerer is less passionate about her quests , unless they involve crack , cocaine , heroin , or crystal meth . She still carries her purple backpack , which is mostly filled with pipes , used needles , shrooms , and an emergency stash of weed .

" This is the first time at Nickelodeon where we ' ve had to bleep out curse words , " said McDoiley .
