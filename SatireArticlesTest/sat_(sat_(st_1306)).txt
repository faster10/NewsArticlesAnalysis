" We are urging that no citizen open up or even touch these patient satisfaction surveys until further notice . Build a small fire outdoors , pick up the survey with a pair of kitchen tongs , then incinerate the survey and tongs . As far as email surveys are concerned , we recommend that you delete them immediately without opening . Our concern is that the virus could mutate to a computer borne strain , and it isn ' t worth taking the chance . I mean , everyone knows this patient satisfaction data is meaningless , anyway . If you were happy with the care you received in a particular hospital , just voice your satisfaction by going there again when you need medical care . "
