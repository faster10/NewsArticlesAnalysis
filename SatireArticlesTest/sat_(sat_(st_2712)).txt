" Well , I mean , look , " Gowdy said , " I ' m not saying we will or won ' t find anything if we spend another few million . But let me ask you this what does it say about me and my conservative mantra of small government that I ' d be willing to spend millions and millions of dollars ultimately to find absolutely nothing criminal ? Does it mean I ' m full of shit ? Does it make me a massive hypocrite ? Of course it does . But let me ask you another question . Will by constituents and or Republicans who simply hate Hillary care if I waste more of their money ? Of course not . They ' ll keep blaming poor people for taking their tax dollars , but me ? I can waste as much money as I want . YEE HAW ! "
