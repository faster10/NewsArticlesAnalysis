Kershaw simply dominated the progress note from the get go despite suboptimal conditions of poor lighting and a splotchy pen . He left pronouns , nouns , verbs , and prepositions in the dust , and displayed his complete mastery of abbreviations , acronyms , the no symbol ( ) , shorthand , commas , slashes , and numbers , all the while walking the fine line between legibility and illegibility . It was a true masterpiece and one that can be appreciated whether or not you ' re a fan of Kershaw .
