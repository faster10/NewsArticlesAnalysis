PhRMA sometimes flaunted its elite clientele . " We don ' t just hang out with elite politicians , they pay us large sums of money to advise them , " a recent PhRMA email said . Another one read : " . . . elite politicians like Tom Delay and Billy Tauzin are routinely paid for their services to us in cashier ' s checks . " The company boasted a client list that included scores of politicians from federal , state and local government . According to federal prosecutors , Tauzin was its premier client as well as its pied piper , bringing in star lawmakers from the Senate and House . " All of us wanted to deal with the guy , " says Gregg Tafralis , a former congressman from Ohio and one of Tauzin ' s original customers . " The guy is the smartest son of a bitch I ' ve ever met in my life . "
