The AISSS ' s findings might concern some candidates , but Dr Carson didn ' t seem phased when I was asked about them at a campaign rally in Michigan later that day . " Well , sure , if you go back and listen to everything I say and analyze it with critical thinking , " Carson said , " you ' re going to find a bunch of stuff that isn ' t true . But does that make me a liar , or just someone who lives in a rich fantasy world ? Am I liar or just plain stupid ? That ' s the question , isn ' t it ? "
