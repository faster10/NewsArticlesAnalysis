One such report comes from Congressman John Sarbanes of Maryland , who recounted , " I was at the podium , Congress was in session , and all of the sudden the doors burst open , and there ' s the President . He strutted down the aisle shaking hands with everyone , asking if ' you guys are alright ' or if ' anyone needed anything ' . I had to tell him we were getting ready to make a serious vote on labor laws , to which he apologized and said he would ' just hang in the back , if that was okay ' . "
