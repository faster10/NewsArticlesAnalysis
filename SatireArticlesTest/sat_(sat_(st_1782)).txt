Regardless of the opinions of outsiders , Michael was proud to report that his daughter has not posted a single photo online since . She even went as far to throw her web cam away . " I consider this a victory " , Michael stated . " There is no way in hell I will ever see my daughter posing on some tacky alt adult site in my lifetime . I encourage other parents to employ the same methods if they want to straighten out their kids in a hurry . They may hate you now , but they will thank you later . "
