" Every day at about the same time , I start noticing people listening to trite , boring standards like Queen ' s ' We Will Rock You ' or ' Another One Bites the Dust ' , " said Dolton . " That ' s when I start cranking up stuff like the late era Coltrane stuff that lacks the pedantries of melody and coherency , knowing the unusual notes will just faintly touch the ears of my co workers , causing them to think , ' Gosh ! This is some neat stuff ! ' "
