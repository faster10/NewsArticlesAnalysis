One of the nation ' s leading scientific research organizations has concluded that the more someone uses the word " cuck " in their everyday speech , the smaller their penis tends to be . The term cuck is Internet slang for " cuckold , " a word that up until the digital age was used to mean any man whose wife had an extramarital affair . However , in the digital age , online pornographers shortened the word to " cuck , " and films that feature " cuckolding " more often than not have a theme of a young , white wife who has sex with a large , African American male , most often in front of her husband .
