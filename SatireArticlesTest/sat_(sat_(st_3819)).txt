I was standing outside my parents closed bedroom door , eavesdropping , as my Mom and Dad were having an argument not angry , fearful on my Mom ' s part , calm on my Dad ' s as she begged him to carry the gun . My Dad was chuckling , trying to soothe her it turned out he was putting the bullets in a Baggie in a drawer and the gun in the closet . He had no intention of going armed . Years later , after he died , I found the bullets , still in the Baggie , in his drawer .
