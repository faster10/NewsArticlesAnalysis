At the request of Donald Rumsfeld , an August 2002 Defense Department memo laid down new ground rules for what constitutes medical malpractice for psychiatrists at US military prisons . If an Army psychiatrist " knows that severe psychological trauma will result from his treatment , " but if causing such harm " is not his objective , he lacks the requisite specific intent even though he did not act in good faith . " The doctor is guilty of malpractice only " if he acts with the express purpose of inflicting harm or suffering on a patient within his control . "
