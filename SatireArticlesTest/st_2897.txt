" Some of you , particularly those of you who are now shouting out words in your colorful native languages , should also think on this .

Last week , in the Super Bowl , a team called the " Patriots " won the game , and a star spangled halftime show won our hearts . Now comes your chance . What better tribute for you to give than to allow the United States of America to win every Olympic gold medal , in every event , in front of the home crowd .
