Despite Martin ' s annoyance , it would seem that these fans will also serve as honorary proof readers . After reviewing the first draft of the novel , they will be able to offer their advice and input before the book goes to print . This way , if the " proof readers " are upset with the fate of a character , or greatly dislike parts of the plot , changes can be made before it ' s too late . Chances are , if these specially selected fans aren ' t satisfied with the product , the majority of Martin ' s devotees won ' t be , either .
