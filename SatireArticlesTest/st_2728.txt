" I have to be honest , " said Trump , " I felt discriminated against for a few moments , and now I understand what that ' s like , I really do . But we had a terrific , terrific meeting . We actually didn ' t think we were going to be having a press conference . But it was such a good meeting , we thought we would do that , and we had many , many endorsements coming out of the meeting . I saw love in that room , I see love everywhere I go , " he said .
