The WHO claims that in 2012 , more than 40 million children age 5 and under were overweight or obese . The WHO ' s own projections are that if changes are not put into effect , that number will jump to 70 million by 2025 . The Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity claims on their website that the food industry can play a " significant role in reducing childhood obesity " by " reducing the fat , sugar and salt content " of foods and " ensuring that healthy and nutritious choices are available " .
