" It ' s a serious injustice , and I am deeply insulted ! " Mr Flemmings told reporters . " With my income , I rarely go to the restaurant , so I try to get as much as I can for my money when I do . This was the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant . Not only did they kick me out while I was still hungry , but they looked at me like I was disgusting , like I was not worthy of eating there ! It ' s unacceptable , and I demand a compensation ! "
