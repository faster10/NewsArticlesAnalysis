" We will consider everything to make it more competitive , " said deputy chairman Lubomir Kotleba " At this point , we rule out nothing . Be it asking the United States to bring their WNBA players , high school players , or to literally not participate for an entire half , we now see that this event has to be modified for the best interests of everyone else , because they are not as good . If that means , ultimately , not inviting the United States , then so be it . "
