United States Secretary Condoleezza Rice took a well earned break from threatening Iran this week in order to threaten Japan over it ' s re instatement of a ban on all U . S . beef imports , something Ms . Rice has found hard to swallow . Telling Japan ' s Foreign Minister Taro Aso that the ban was " half baked " , Ms . Rice went on to claim that Japan ' s fears were , " over done " . Aso responded by saying his people were still grilling American inspectors about the U . S . ' s system for checking beef quality , saying the whole thing looked well , fishy . In other U . S . Japanese news , Aso and Rice agreed to continue to try to cook up a realignment plan for troops based in Japan that will keep GI ' s away from cute Japanese women as much as possible , another meat related issue . President George W . Bush also weighed in , saying that if Japan wouldn ' t lift the ban he was going to remove Gray Wolves from the Endangered Species List .
