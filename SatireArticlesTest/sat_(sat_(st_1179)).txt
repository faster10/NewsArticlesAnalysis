" I think it ' s fun , the patient does too , and the message hits closer to home , " internist David Foote explains , refilling his cardboard box with bloody ears , breasts , and lungs . For example , if Dr Foote has an alcoholic patient , he ' ll offer the patient a free liver to mess around with and see if the patient likes the idea of a transplant and its complications . Oftentimes , the patient will clean up their act , no questions asked . " Then as a bonus , the patient spreads the message by having their family and friends play with the liver . Not too shabby , don ' t you think ?
