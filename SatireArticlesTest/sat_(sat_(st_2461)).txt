Even more draconian , according to the ACLU , are Republican proposals now being advanced which would subject Food Stamp and government aid recipients to random testing for shellfish consumption . The test is said to be able to detect the presence of lobster , crab , scallops and fried calamari appetizers . ( Note : Florida is the only Republican controlled state to balk at shellfish detection after the ' Florida Sea Food Advisory Council ' announced that it would have a negative impact on sales , while in Wisconsin , lawmakers added that current residents receiving food aid , should be restricted in their cheese selections , to Wisconsin cheeses only ) .
