" Pope Francis left Congress a very negative review on Yelp , " Rep . Paul Ryan ( R WI ) told reporters early Monday morning , " and I just don ' t appreciate that at all . " Ryan said the two star rating from Pope Francis would have been " bad enough " but the comments he left " just crossed the line . " According to Ryan , Pope Francis complained in his Yelp review that Congressional service was slow , the decor was " antiquated " and that there was a " stunning lack of religious artifacts decorating the halls . " Ryan said Pope Francis ' review admonished Congress to " take a cue from the Vatican and install some gold plated thingamabobs and a throne or two would be sweet too . "
