" Income inequality is the result of having an overbearing , oversized , overreaching Federal government . I believe the free markets will put a stop to income inequality , but we need to offer the sorts of deregulations they ' ll need to make that happen . We need to also lower taxes on the top one percent , eliminate capital gains , and get rid of Obamacare . All of those things are disincentivizing the free markets from paying lower income workers a livable wage . If we just trust in the free markets , if we put our faith in those who put their faith in God , income inequality will be a thing of the past . "
