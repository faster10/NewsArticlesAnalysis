This transformation began four days into his presidency when , after sundown on Saturday , Jan . 24 , Obama was circumcised in a secret bris performed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , in which the then 47 year old President reportedly " cried like a yutzi girl . " ( And now you know where their " strained relationship " comes from . ) Also , when visiting Israel or dining with Woody Allen , Obama refers to his wife and daughters as Miriam , Hashana and Dalia , and every Hanukah he has Jay Z and Oprah perform the mother in law scene from " Yentl . " For his part , Romney has long vowed that if he had been U . S . president in the 2nd Century B . C . when the Jews rededicated the temple , he would have supplied enough American drilled oil to keep the lamps burning for 8 million days . He also supports expanding West Bank settlements by building " modest , 10 , 000 square foot homes for middle class settlers . And most telling , Romney has repeatedly stated that he loves Israel so much he wants to buy it .
