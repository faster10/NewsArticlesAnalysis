" We have found a way where the government can now create an unlimited amount of debt , run unlimited deficits , spend unlimited amounts of money , print money until there are no trees left , ensure the stability of the dollar , make all goods non economic goods by completely eliminating scarcity ( like super abundant air , which nobody has to work for ) , and guarantee that every man , woman , and child will have abundance , " said President elect Barack Obama . " We cracked the code to prosperity . We can even guarantee intelligence for every man , woman , and child . I am going to create utopia . "
