When one reporter from The Dallas Gazette and BBQ Coupon Book asked Jeb ! how he could be so sure that his family ' s secret recipe for Middle East success would work when the Afghanistan War has been running longer than Vietnam , and Iraq was such an abject failure on all fronts , the younger Bush became noticably perturbed . " Oh sure , the liberal media would try to gotcha me with the fact that I have no actual foreign policy experience myself , " Jeb ! bemoaned while continuing , " and that both of the previous two members of my family to be president have mostly just gotten us further entangled in a region we should be helping in some other capacity . " After taking a moment to think , " But that ' s the liberal media for you . They ' ll say it ' s journalistic integrity to ask me tough questions so the public knows if I ' m truly qualified and whether I represent the values they want me to represent , but we all know that ' s poppy cock . "
