ATLANTA , GA Last week Robert De Niro pushed for the Andrew Wakefield ( yes , that Wakefield ) film Vaxxed to be screened . " We need to have the conversation about ' safe ' vaccines . " De Niro claims that we should have a conversation about this topic discrediting the multiple studies that continue to prove the link between autism and vaccines untrue . Despite the film maker ' s prior job as a gastroenterologist who published a fake made up study , backed by his own financial interests , to link the MMR vaccine to autism , De Niro sees nothing wrong with this . The study was eventually found out to be a fraud but not before thousands of innocent children have become sick from parents who listen to celebrities rather than scientists . This caused a bold , but fair reaction from the CDC .
