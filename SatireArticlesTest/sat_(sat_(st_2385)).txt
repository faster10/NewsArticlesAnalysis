" My question is this , " Rep . Trey Gowdy ( R SC ) told reporters at a press conference held after news of the Pope ' s negative review broke , " is it a coincidence that the Pope ' s review came just three years and a few days after the Benghazi attacks ? I think we all know the Pope has some questions to answer , but so do Hillary Clinton and President Obama . " Gowdy insisted that he " will not rest " until he has " chased down every wild eyed conspiracy theory about the connection between the Pope ' s Yelp review and Benghazi , even if I have to invent the connection to justify the millions of dollars I ' m going to waste investigating it .
