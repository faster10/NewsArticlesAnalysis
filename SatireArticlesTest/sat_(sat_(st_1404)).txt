" There ' s one guy with OCD when he comes in for his meds , we tell him 15 minutes . " ' If we try to give him the meds before 15 minutes , he ' s there with a stopwatch to tell us it ' s only been 14 minutes and 33 seconds . When we went past 15 minutes once well , we don ' t really want to revisit that day . We ' re still trying to manage our own obsessions about his compulsions . We need this lane . "
