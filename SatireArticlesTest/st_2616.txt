Samil said that in terms of color , he ' s hoping the carpet bombs are " either a nice , deep green " or " a classy beige . " He told our interviewer that " stain guard is an absolute must " where he lives because " maybe you ' ll be cleaning spilled tea , or maybe you ' ll be cleaning your uncle ' s charred corpse out of the fibers " so being able to quickly and easily clean the new carpet that will be dropped on them by U . S . bombers is " totally a deal breaker . " Samil told us the drapes his mother put up are a " really nice set of cardboard boxes " his father cut up and duct taped to the windows that were blown out during a gun battle that was raging in the street just outside their home .
