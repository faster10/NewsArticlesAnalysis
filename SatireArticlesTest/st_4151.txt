Today , people are protesting again , but for far different reasons . They ' re angry because the government has been trying for the last year or so to stabilize not only the economy of the United States , but the entire world . They ' re angry that that government wants to fix a healthcare system that even they admit is out of control , provide resources to major employers to let them keep their doors open and millions of workers employed and restructure mortgages to let people keep their homes . They say all these things which are being done to insure the future economic stability of America cost too much money and are too intrusive . They say these are examples of creeping socialism and will not only result in the government controlling our lives but leaving generations to come with massive and unsustainable debt , mostly because they ' re not willing to pay any extra taxes now to help those future generations foot the bill they just want the perks . Baby Boomers .
