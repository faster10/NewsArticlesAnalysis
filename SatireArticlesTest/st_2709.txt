" It was the weirdest thing , I looked outside my kitchen window and saw this guy standing at the edge my pool , just casting and casting into it , " was how Philip McGregorson told reporters he came upon a member of congress that day . " I went outside and asked him what he was doing fishing in my empty swimming pool , " McGregorson told reporters , " and he just looked at me with these dead eyes and said , ' I ' m gonna be here as long as it takes to get the fish I know you ' re hiding from me . ' " McGregorson said there never was , nor will there ever be any fish in his swimming pool .
