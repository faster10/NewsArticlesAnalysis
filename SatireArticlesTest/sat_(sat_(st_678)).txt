" Once when we were , like , 14 we got my older brother to get us some Zima , " said childhood friend Keith Peterson , " but Mike wouldn ' t touch it . I mean , it was there for the taking . All he had to do was give in and let us pour it down his throat , but he just kept his mouth shut and wouldn ' t budge . We feared the worst when he told us that he couldn ' t be friends with us anymore , because a person with anti social problems like that needs a support team , so we hung in there for him and , sure enough , eventually he came around on his own .
