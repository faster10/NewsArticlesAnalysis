First of all , I know Kimmy personally . Like , on a personal level . I was just messaging him on WhatsApp . And let me tell you , that dude is funny . We have a ton of inside jokes that still haven ' t gotten old . Like , he always mocks me for how I keep losing to him in H . O . R . S . E . , and I always tell him not to execute his guards if they giggle when he gets to H . O . You know , friend stuff .
