Levi says that " it ' s just too premature to look at 45 separate school shootings as an indication of a problem that needs solving . " Levi said in his estimation " a minimum of 30 or 40 more " school shootings would be where he ' d set the threshold and even then , he says , " you really might be overreacting . " Levi also warned against reading too much into the fact that the Umpqua shooter was a young , self described hard line conservative who frequented the corners of the Internet where fringe conspiracy theories and violent fantasies are encouraged . " All that stuff does is tell us what motivated him to kill those people , why does that have to matter when we ' re talking about our sacred , American God given right to own any guns we want to , " Levi asked rhetorically .
