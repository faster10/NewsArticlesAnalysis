Thinkwell staffers claim Notch ' s vision is to build a park where " visitors get to live out a Minecraft experience in real life . " It will feature three distinct zones , the biggest of which will be the " Overworld . " This will make up the bulk of the park , where visitors will take in countless rides , live shows , and other attractions , and can even build things with specially built life sized blocks . At night , the park will fill up with performers acting out the roles of zombies , skeletons , and even exploding " creeper " monsters , prompting guests to return to their hotel rooms when the park begins to close .
