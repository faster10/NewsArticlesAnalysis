A source that works close with a White House staffer says that Obama was " inconsolable " by late Thursday evening and " sequestered himself in the Oval Office with a laptop playing non stop Prince music " including several hours where the song " Purple Rain " was said to have played on repeat . The staffer alleges that the President " cut short some meetings on Friday so he could properly mourn the loss of Prince " . While many never knew that President Obama was such a huge fan of the recently deceased singer , things in the nation ' s capital have gotten even stranger in the wake of the musician ' s death .
