" Never mind the tree huggers and the green crowd , " said Trump . " I ' m going to tap that gas , tap that gas , and frack and frack out of this country . There won ' t be a region of the United States at the end of my first year in office that I haven ' t tapped , drilled , or fracked . The Saudis and the Arabs will be buying oil from us , instead of the other way around . They ' ll be on their knees , I guarantee it . "
