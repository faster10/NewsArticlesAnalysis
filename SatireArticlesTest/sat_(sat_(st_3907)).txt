A pratical man , Mitt Rmoney is , who believes we should ' ve just let the entire American auto industry go bankrupt and reorganize ( in China ) . But still , a modest man who only has inexpensive high end Cadillac ' s at both his mansions , presumably because all those horses cost so much to maintain . In other words , a Man ( of 1 ) Of The People . A teetotaler and a pure man who apparently believes it ' s God ' s will that he take millions in campaign contributions derived from overseas gambling joints . Forget Kenya , for exoticism you can ' t beat that ( And by the way , what kinda name is Mitt anyway ? I mean , if your dad was Mickey Mantle or Babe Ruth I could see it , but Mitt ? Thank god who I ' ll be myself if I become a Mormon with the proper Temple Reccomend before I die my dad stuck me with Chuck , nasty rhymes notwithstanding ) .
