Did I take my time to grade this ? Hah , okay , where do I begin ? I ' m in grad school right now , which means I ' m balls deep in thesis revisions and grad school poo nanny . I ' ve got about enough time to grade your papers as I do to build myself a water desalinator to stave off dehydration while holding onto a life raft made of empty diploma frames out in this open ocean called " my thesis proposal . " Plus , I just moved back in with my mom , who says I have to practice the piano four hours a week if I want to live rent free . I ' ve got a recital coming up and that ' s super stressful !
