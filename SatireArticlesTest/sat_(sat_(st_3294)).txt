I am writing to complain about Dr Brown , who is a professor here at the University of British Columbia . On Wednesday , after his " lecture , " I approached him with a question . Seems pretty simple , right ? There were other people lined up behind me it was like any other day after class . His response , however , was rude and , well , frankly , pretty mean . He said , and I quote , that he " could not give out the email addresses of everyone in the class , no matter how relevant the material I wanted to distribute was . " Wow . Kick me while I ' m down , why don ' t you ?
