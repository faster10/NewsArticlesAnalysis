And speaking of Google , I know a lot of people see Facebook and Google as the two contenders for the world of the future . Some of you may even have the dream of working for Google . That ' s cool .

But did you also know they ' re sleeping together , even though Sanjay is married and Patricia has a boyfriend who bought a ring last week and was going to give it to her after the ceremony today ? I found that on their Facebook pages . And it ' s just the kind of deeply personal information Google wants to get its hands on and publicize to the world . Unlike Facebook , which would never do that .
