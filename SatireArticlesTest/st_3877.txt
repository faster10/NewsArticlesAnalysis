" Good Morning Sister Mary Ellen . " I said , my voice rising and falling in that same sing song cadence that little kids use when a teacher walks into the room . It had been a lot of years , but I still knew that face . Sister Mary Ellen , my third grade teacher . I was sure she couldn ' t forget me how well I could recall all those happy days we spent together in class 3 D , practicing penmanship and getting whacked every time I came up with a wrong math answer . But she was a demon on the kickball court good legs and that billowing Habit made it impossible to tell which direction the ball was going to go . I still carry a shin scar from getting a bit too close to her in the heat of a game .
