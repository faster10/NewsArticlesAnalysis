The scientists believe that the settlement could indeed be the legendary Norse colony known as " Vinland " , mentioned in the Icelandic Sagas . Based on the idea that the name meant " wine land " , historians had long speculated that the region contained wild grapes . Wild grapes were , indeed , still growing in many areas of the Hudson Valley when the first European settlers arrived in the region , so the archaeologists believe that this could really be the colony described in the mythological saga .
