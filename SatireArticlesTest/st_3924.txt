" I ' m told there ' s this fella named Google who ' s planning to take over the Internet and read everybody ' s e mail soon . Sounds like my kind of guy . When he does , I ' ll offer him a cabinet post . Then those ' newz ' sights won ' t be able to say anything about me that isn ' t good . If they do , Google will send his Web trawlers out to intercept them , and they won ' t be heard from again . "
