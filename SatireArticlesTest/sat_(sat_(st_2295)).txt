Fallin said she signed the bill out of the worry that should these anti progress leftists get their way , it " would drive businesses to other communities and states , and would raise prices for consumers . " She also argued that " mostly young and single people are working part time or entry level jobs where they possess the capacity to pull themselves up by their bootstraps " and that " most high school or college students live with their parents in middle class families and have no need for such petty ' job killing ' mandates . " She warned that without the Walmart Protection Act ( W . P . A . ) , radical leftist operatives " would require job creators to fire many of those industrious workers " and harm small business . Opponents of the W . P . A . use sketchy studies funded by George Soros backed Marxist promotion groups to make claims not backed up by fact . They counterclaim the typical American entry level wage worker is 35 and more than a quarter have children to support . More than half work full time , and 44 percent ( half a million ) are college graduates .
