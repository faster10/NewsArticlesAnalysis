According to court records , Britney only wanted " the best traditional American future " for her daughter . " There ' s nothing wrong with what I did , " she said . " I see all these tv shows with kids having 2 divorced moms or lesbian fathers and I decided to take a stand . I taught my daughter some traditional American routines so maybe she could get on commercials or tv shows to speak for us instead of the liberals all the time . I did nothing wrong and I ' ll do it again ! "
