CNN , the nation ' s oldest all news cable program , marks it ' s thirty year anniversary on June 1st . For the hard of counting , that means the station , then under the leadership of Ted Turner , started broadcasting in 1981 ( or 80 . What year is this ? ) Back then I remember thinking two things first , that a TV station that would only broadcast straight news twenty four hours a day was a pretty cool thing , and second , that a station that broadcast only straight news twenty four hours a day could never last . I was right on both counts , although it took a lot longer than I figured for the second prediction to come true .
