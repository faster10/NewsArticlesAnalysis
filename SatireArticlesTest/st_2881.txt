So maybe now you understand why this 4 . 5 billion , and whatever other non edible penalties you add to it later , don ' t really do it for us . Think of it as a trust thing . What ' s that old Cold War phrase ? Trust and verify ? I mean , we all heard Bob Dudley , BP ' s chief executive , say the company , " deeply regrets the tragic loss of life . " That ' s nice , but since his people kind of killed about 220 of my siblings in 10 seconds , I personally find it hard to trust the guy . And not living in his neighborhood , we won ' t be able to verify that he " deeply regrets it . Whereas if we eat him , we ' ll know he deeply regrets it . We can verify that . By the look on his face . And afterwards , by the look on his not face .
