Moonlight glittered off the pins in Sharon ' s hat , reflecting ivory hues back through the windows of 5 West ( not to be confused with the nursing floor 5 North Northwest , where they give terrible nursing care , nicknamed the Death Star ) . Sharon hummed softly as she sat , her stockinged legs keeping time to her tune as they vainly tried to reach the floor . Sharon never washed her stockings on Saturday or ironed her nurse ' s uniform on Friday , so she was sure luck was with her tonight .
