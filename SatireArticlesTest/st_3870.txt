I remember driving up to Las Vegas just as darkness was falling , but after a few days of driving around in the desert , it looked like such a light stain on the land that I drove right on through it and into the darkness on the other side . Shame too a girl I knew in California had set me up to stay with her friend there for a few days , but at that point the last thing I needed was another woman . Or maybe it was exactly what I needed , who knows .
