" Like hell am I going to let any activist , radical Christian keep me from doing as my ancestors have done for centuries , " said local Mithran Burt Smith as he prepared to sever the head of a live boar to roast and serve at the " Lord of Misrule " celebration . " According to the Church , I ' m supposed to give gifts to loved ones to represent the gifts of the Magi to the Christ Child , but what about picturesquely hanging from a fir tree the corpses of nine kinds of every living thing , sacrificed to the one eyed god Woten , just as we have done for centuries ? The traditions of our forefathers have got to stand for something . "
