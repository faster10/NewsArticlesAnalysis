This new and surprising discovery suggests that Roman military operations could in fact have taken place in Ireland in the first Century of this era , without having been recorded by historians . We know that in AD 81 , after an impressive four year campaign to conquer and secure central Britain , the Roman general Gnaeus Julius Agricola gathered an invasion force on the Clyde Forth line . He stood on the shores of western Scotland with an exiled Irish chieftain by his side and gazed across the narrow North Channel to the Antrim hills , in Ireland . This story as related by Roman historians could in fact find an equivalence in Irish mythology .
