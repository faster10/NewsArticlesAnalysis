A medical student is healthy appearing , but carries a lot of weight in his or her white coat : journal articles , index cards , a review book , medical tuning forks , reflex hammers , ophthalmoscope , microscope , colonoscope , and calipers . A resident is chronically ill appearing . A resident ' s white coat carries the bare minimum of a stethoscope and patient list but he or she will have a bigger belly and larger love handles compared to four years ago in medical school .
