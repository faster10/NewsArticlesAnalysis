Remember , these Props are usually sweeping in nature you can ' t raise property taxes above a certain level for any reason or you have to fund something and can ' t not do it without another Prop vote like that . To a New Yorker , it ' s the silliest thing I ever saw . In theory it sounds great governance by the people . But I ' ve been spending a lot of time in this state for several years now and although Californian ' s are nice enough , they ' re just not qualified to be lawmakers . It ' s a pretty knee jerk society , just like the rest of America . And what sounds good this year may look pretty stupid next year , but the law will still be there . To change it , you have to go through the whole process again or file a lawsuit challenging it ' s constitutionality because as I understand it , lawmakers can ' t amend a Prop law .
