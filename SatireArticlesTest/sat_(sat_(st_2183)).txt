Kuhnter said that while " it ' s true that America has tons of socialist programs that are decades old " Sanders ' brand of socialism is different . " I mean , sure he ' s proposing that we basically just go back to the way things were before Reagan took office , and sure we have plenty of historical evidence that shows our tax code was written in a way that allowed our economy to be quite robust and grow at historical levels for decades , but socialism man ! I don ' t want to sound like cislord shit scum Koch brother whore all libtards talk like that and burst you hippies bubbles , but grassroots campaigns don ' t do anything anytmore , just ask the Tea Party , " Kuhnter added .
