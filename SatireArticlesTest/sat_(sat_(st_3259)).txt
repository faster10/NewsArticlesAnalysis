While listeners of " Chameleon " often find themselves transported to strange new worlds , funk utopias as numerous as the stars , our earthly bodies will one day decay . With the heat death of our own universe looming , we must find another planet , if only for the human race to propagate and continue to pay homage to the righteous funk Mr Hancock hath wrought . Failing that , we must beam a signal of " Chameleon , " repeated with some frequency , into the outer reaches .

For if there is an idea worth sharing , that is it . '
