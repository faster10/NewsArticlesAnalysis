" Over the last two weeks , my coat ' s just gotten shorter and shorter . It doesn ' t even reach my belt line anymore . Yesterday , the med student ordered me to grab him some gauze and a kerlix . The med student , for god ' s sake . I used to be the senior on the team , now I ' m the supply mule . I can ' t even use my pockets to carry stuff because they ' ve been cut off ! "
