But parents are outraged by the school district ' s decision . " This doesn ' t make any sense to me . You can ' t pray to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ in that school , but they can force you to become a Muslim ? " says Georgette McCullough , a parent and local PTA member . " I heard what happened to that girl , and yes , it was wrong . But what if a kid gets bullied for being fat ? Are we going to force all the students to eat cupcakes ? This is absurd , and it isn ' t Christian . "
