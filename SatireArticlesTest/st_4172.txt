But here ' s the catch ( there ' s always a catch ) some drunken lenders , thinking they were being clever , said to the little guys , ' Look , we ' ll give you these drinks really cheap now , but later on , you ' ll have to pay full price for them . We ' ll call it Adjustable Rate Mortgages , or ARMS . How bad is that ? We all have arms and they ' re very good things . Anyway , don ' t worry , you can always sell your bottle to someone else if you want , and for more money . " The little guys , looking at the Moet Chandon houses the lenders were waving in front of them , said , " Shure , shure , jush giff me the bottle . "
