" I ' m very glad he spoke up , as the rest of the team was busy intubating a patient , " continued Lemmon . " The team hadn ' t realized that Mr Winabego left his pain medication prescription on the bus he takes to his mother ' s house so he can help get her to dialysis . Fortunately , I was able to refill that prescription . " Lemmon took a reflective pause . " I was really surprised to find such a helpful patient in the emergency department . I ' m sorry I won ' t have the chance to see Mr Winabego on a regular basis . "
