Phish is a radical funk metal trip bop band that caters to the very element that Rob Monday represents . Gang fights , drug abuse , and prostitution are commonplace at their shows . Filthy degenerative drug gangs shoot ellis dee meths into their veins while partying before the shows in epic " lot scenes . " Maniac drum circles , careless fireworks play , and the howling of animal like sexual perversity can be heard above the hissing of nitrous oxide tanks in the parking lot before a Phish concert .
