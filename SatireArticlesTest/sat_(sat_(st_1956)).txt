The anti religious and anti social aspects of the Grateful Dead and their effect on the nation ' s youth was apparent then as it still is now . When Vietnam Conflict protesters burned draft cards and interfered with Mayor Daly ' s nightly baseball bat games , the dangerous ramifications of ellis dee became illuminated . Police and civic leaders moved to block Dead performances and even arrest band members for not walking right . The shakedowns became ever more increasing . Communities where the Grateful Dead performed became frustrated with the caravan of deadheads that would show up and congregate . Eventually , deadheads were banished to the desert , where evil sweet talkers would form dangerous cults that performed sacrilegious masses and ritual killings . A group of these deadheads became known as the " Family " and wound up behind bars for some front page tabloid killings . Other heads would end up incarcerated for dealing narcotics in the form of ellis dee poppers , marijuana spliffs , and mushroom pizzas served with a side of grilled cheese .
