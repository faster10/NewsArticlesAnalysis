It ' s not much I know , but as long as you keep fighting , I ' ll keep writing . As they say , this too shall pass and one day you can go home , lay in your own bed and finally rest , comfortable in the knowledge of the good you ' ve done in your son Casey ' s memory . You have the prayers and good wishes of literally millions of us here and around the world . I hope that gives you strength and comfort .
