" You can ' t keep revisiting your past and worrying about things you should have done , or decisions you wish you had made differently , " said Konklin . " I mean , it ' s too bad that all those people died when my bridge over the Red River Gorge catastrophically collapsed , but it ' s just not healthy to dwell on mistakes of the past , because what ' s done is done . Life is short , and if I wasted all the time that other engineers spend worrying about the difference between tensile and compressive strength of concrete , my whole life would have passed me by , and I ' d be left with nothing .
