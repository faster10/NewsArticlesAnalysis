An alleged move by the Donald Trump campaign plans to award 45 million in taxpayer money to 45 random Facebook users that have shared a Facebook status promoting the Republican candidate . Critics such as political reporter John Alcocer , have already voiced concerns that such a strategy is " essentially the same thing as buying votes . " Alcocer contends that , " We ' ll just ignore the fact that a President would not be able to allocate tax money to U . S . citizens like that . Considering that were even something a U . S . President could do , Donald Trump ' s plan would not be allowed as he would be running a sweepstakes tied to his political campaign . That is not allowed . "
