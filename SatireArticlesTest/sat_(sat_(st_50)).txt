" I ' m extremely proud to have broken a World Record , " Ms . Sullivan told reporters . " My mother always told me that I was lazy and worthless , and that I would never accomplish anything in my life . Now , I ' ve shown everyone that she was wrong , and that I can even be the best in the world when I put my mind to something . In fact , I ' ve just accomplished something that no one had done before ! "
