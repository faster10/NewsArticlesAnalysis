All of the musician ' s albums were in the capsule , as well as Kanye ' s favorite candy , Airheads . " I put a dozen blue Airheads in there as a peace offering . I love those things as much as I do my family . I stare into my mirror looking at my blue colored tongue after eating every Airhead . That was the inspiration for my last album . Picasso had his blue period ' but he stole that from me and my Airheads . "
