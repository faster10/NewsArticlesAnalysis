My Dad would take me to the barber , I ' d get a haircut , and my barber would hand me a bucket with free candy . Man oh man , that was the best ! I would always choose a red lollipop . " As an homage to his childhood , Bean and colleagues offer their patients free kidneys out of a similar brightly colored yellow bucket .
