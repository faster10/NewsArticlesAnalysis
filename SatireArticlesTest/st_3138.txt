Kalil , a lobsterman of the Dorothy Alexander , has attracted a crowd around the bar as he recounts a recent bit of news . " I heard that last month , Hasharam , of the Gloria Ann , speared a 20 foot sword and was dragged into the water , " Kalil says , as the Salty Dog patrons , who know Hasharam well , fall silent . " I heard that Hasharam managed to pull the beast halfway onto the boat before its nose broke off and it disappeared . Hasharam lost his left leg , and now uses the broken sword to stand on ! "
