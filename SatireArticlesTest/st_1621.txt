While one officer searched the residence , the other allegedly had to deal with Church , who woke up and tried to escape into his home . That , Angela Church says , is when the officer shot Church in the back , twice . Authorities claim Church " had become irate and verbally hostile , " prior to the shooting . " The officer in question feared for his life , believing Mr Church was a drug kingpin , " says a press release from the San Bernardino Police Department .
