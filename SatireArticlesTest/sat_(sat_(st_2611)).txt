" Ironically , I was on my way to audition for the reality show What Would You Do ? so I thought this was part of the setup . I crossed over to the religious nut ( he was really convicing ) and I said just to chill and have a cup of cocoa . I made this broad gesture toward the cash register security camera and all of a sudden he hits me in the face with a shoe I think . None of the staff tried to help me up or anything . I ' m not even giving one star to that place now ! I depend on my face and now it ' s all swolled up . "
