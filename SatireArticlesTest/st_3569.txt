The initial criticism of Lt . Gov . Knoll came from one Rhonda Goodrich , sister in law to the slain Marine and registered Republican and Anti Michael Moore protestor who swears she has no political bias in the matter . Ms . Goodrich fired off a letter of non political protest to her local paper , the Post Gazette , which spread with the speed of a Joseph Wilson op ed piece in the New York Times around the country well , at least it spread to Provo , Dallas an Orange County , California sparking a firestorm of Conservative and Evangelical outrage . It is still a bit unclear why Conservatives in those states religiously read the letters to the editor page of the Post Gazette with such passion I scan fifty to one hundred news items a day but I must have missed it .
