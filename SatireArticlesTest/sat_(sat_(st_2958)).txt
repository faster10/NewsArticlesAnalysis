Kidding . I have not removed their heads . See , I really do have a great sense of humor . And I see some of you are laughing too . Don ' t . I ' m laughing now . Don ' t laugh if I ' m laughing . You ' re competing with me . I thought I had explained that clearly . Even if you have a good laugh , stop now , because I will build a better , more robust , more vertically integrated laugh . And of course it will be socially networkable a laugh that is " liked everywhere and will run on all platforms and operating systems : iPhone , Android , Linux , Windows , whatever . Your laugh will be small and insignificant . On second thought , I ' ll give you Blackberry ' s OS . I ' ll let you develop your laugh on that . Just to watch your pitiful laugh die more slowly .
