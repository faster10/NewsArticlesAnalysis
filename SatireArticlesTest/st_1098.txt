And Dorfman doesn ' t just stop with looking the part . His emotions are coordinated with his cycle . How could they not be ? After all , his bicycle is made of carbon nanofiber with synthetic organic latex microthin tires , and weighs a total of only 9 . 4 ounces . " Buying a bike that was just one ounce heavier would have saved me 1200 , but it would have cost an extra 21 cent stamp for shipping . Anyhow , I needed to conserve weight for all my patches from my non sponsors . " Dorfman follows this statement by taking a bite out of a 6 power bar and squirting Gatorade from a sports bottle into his mouth and over his face , neck and hair .
