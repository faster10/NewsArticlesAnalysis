Ultimately , Malouf said he ' d " never be happier " than he was to be in America . " Because at least I know the bullets I ' m dodging here are etched with freedom , " he said , " the freedom to carry as much firepower and ammunition you want because you ' re dead convinced someone who is not coming for your guns is in fact coming for your guns .
