Well kids , either way , I hate to burst your bubble , but there are 535 United States senators and congressmen and women in Washington in addition , there are two million civilian federal employees , excluding the postal service , and five out of six of them work in DC too . There is just no way hell that Barak Obama , Ron Paul or Mike Huckabee could ever ' change government ' . Sure , they might even try to do it they could veto legislation , adopt an antagonistic attitude towards those that disagree with them and just do what they think is right no matter what the other branches of government say oh , wait that ' s George Bush and we all know how well that ' s working out . Or maybe you think they can reason with these roughly two million people and make them all change .
