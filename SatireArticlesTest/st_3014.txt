In God ' s defense , Cardinal Edward Egan of New York ' s Roman Catholic archdiocese reminded humans that they were simply not qualified to question His handiwork . " I understand this is a difficult time , and I understand that His sudden attentiveness to New York ' s prayers is awkward , " said Egan . " But we must accept that the Lord truly does work in mysterious ways , and that what He does is all part of His great plan for our future . "
