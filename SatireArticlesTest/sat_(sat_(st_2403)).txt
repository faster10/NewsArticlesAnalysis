Mr Fogle was scheduled for his medical exam the morning of Thursday , August 27th where , with his private lawyer also in attendance , he submitted to being chipped with a subcutaneous RFID label , a nearly undetectable , tiny electronic device roughly the size of a grain of rice , but filled with transmitters and Fogle ' s DNA , which is inserted at the back of his neck , like the kind a dog or cat gets from the vet . The device enables the government to track and locate any bearer in the event of his or her disappearance .
