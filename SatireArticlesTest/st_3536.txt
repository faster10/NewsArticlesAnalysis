The CATO Institute dedicated to individual liberty , limited government and free markets publishes a yearly report on the fiscal policies of state governments and rewards those that cut taxes and spending with the highest grades , while those that increase spending and taxes receive the lowest grades . Colorado and Montana governors received an " A " because they kept their budgets from growing and cut taxes , while Ohio and Missouri received an " F " for increasing state spending and increasing taxes when faced with deficits . For example , Montana Governor Judith Martz ' s proposed tax cuts are called " a supply sider ' s dream " and " the most aggressive " income tax cuts in 2004 .
