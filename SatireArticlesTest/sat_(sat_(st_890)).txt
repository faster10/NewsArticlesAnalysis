" First of all , the ROOM , " continued McElroy . " Small . Awful view all I could see was the parking lot . No drawers or a dresser to put my clothes in . The toilet was clean , and the shower was spacious , but that ' s where the positives end . No carpeting . The floor was frequently sticky . And for some odd reason , there was another sink in the room next to my bed , I have no idea why . Plus , the door had no lock on it , allowing anyone to simply come in and do whatever they wanted , whenever they wanted , at all hours of the day and night . The bed was not comfortable in the least . Housekeeping did come in to change the linens daily , but they insisted on coming in when I was still in the room , and often still in the bed so annoying and SOOO awkward ! Oh , and I was a mile from the elevator . And I never did find the ice machine . "
