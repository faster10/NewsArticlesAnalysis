Washington , DC ( APE ) Al Jazeera today released a videotape , reportedly from Al Qaeda second in command Ayman al Zawahiri , in which he disavows any association with the group of amateur terrorists arrested earlier this week in Miami , FL . He further went on to chastise the US Government and Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in particular for failing to listen to repeated warnings from Al Qaeda in regards to the existence of the group . Zawahiri stated , " We sent them phone numbers that they had tried to use to contact us , bank accounts for which they had requested money be sent to . We even suggested that they interview Richard Reid , because we had knowledge that these men had tried to contact him in prison but they refused to act . We must assume that this has been a deliberate propaganda attempt at smearing the reputation of Al Qaeda . "
