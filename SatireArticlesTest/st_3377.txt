Washington , DC ( APE ) Early this morning , President Bush announced that he had accepted the resignation of an embattled Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General , and presented to a gathering of reporters his next choice for US Attorney General , his brother , former Florida Governor Jeb Bush . Bush sought to assure critics that the pre existing loophole within the patriot act which had allowed Gonzalez to originally fire and replace eight US attorneys without congressional approval , resulting in controversy for the administration was still in effect and legally allowed for the appointment of his brother . In a reversal of positions Bush now vowed to fight any effort by Congress to , what he described as " politicize the process " and attempt a rewrite of the legislation .
