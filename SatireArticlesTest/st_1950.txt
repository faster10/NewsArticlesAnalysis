" Our views of the terrible , heinous terrorist acts perpetrated by ISIS cannot blind us from the simple truth that these billboards , however offensive , are clearly and undeniably protected by the First Amendment , " ruled Indiana Federal Judge Michael Hunt , in a statement regarding why he refused to hear the case . " The billboards were rightfully paid for , the privately owned company that manages those billboards has decided they ' re worth showing , and there ' s nothing distasteful about the advertisements themselves , other than ISIS having paid for them . I see no reason why this case should be heard in my courtroom . "
