I suggest we make Washington D . C . an ' Extra constitutional zone ' ( A place where the US Constitution is not in force ) . That way anything we do there is above the law . We could seize a few square blocks of run down housing and bring Gitmo right into the capitol , talk about convenience . Not only can we bring terrorists in , but we could also bring American citizens into the ' Extra constitutional zone ' to question them in ways that would other wise be unconstitutional .
