No , of course not I wouldn ' t be writing about it a week later if it had been . Anyway , Mr Bill and Juan were chatting on air on The O ' Reilly Fracture two days ago ( God , was it just two days ago ? It seems more like forty eight hours . ) and Billy was whining about it . He asked Juan about whether he was wrong in his views on The View . Juan answered something along the lines of when he sees Muslims dressed in Muslim garb , or in other words , " A person who identifies themselves first and foremost as a Muslim , I get nervous . "
