Representatives of the world ' s powerful hedge funds met in the U . S . town of Greenwich , CT over the weekend to discuss a coordinated strategy for profiting from the Danish situation . The Daily Currant spoke exclusively to a participant in the meeting who explained that the funds plan to use currency options to gain a leveraged long position in Krone , then pour hot money into the currency in hopes of making it too expensive for Denmark ' s central bank to maintain the peg . Once the peg is broken the options should multiply in value as the currency rises .
