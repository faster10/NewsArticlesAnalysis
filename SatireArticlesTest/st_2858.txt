" I ' m just standing there trying to get my Loaded Italian , when all of a sudden this guy with a gun walks up to the counter and demands the worker empty the register . We were all terrified . Next thing I know , Batman is here and he punches the guy square in the nose . The gun flies out of his hands and he runs out of there . I got one good look at Batman and I swear on my life , under that mask was unmistakably Affleck . "
