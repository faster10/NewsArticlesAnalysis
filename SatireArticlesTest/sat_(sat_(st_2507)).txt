" Would it have been so hard to just put one more lectern on the stage , " Ryan asked at the end of his post . " Would it be so difficult for the GOP to just stop all the charades with polls and primaries and give Rand Paul the nomination ? Or better yet , why can ' t they just call up Rand ' s dad and declare him not only the nominee , but the president , " he asked rhetorically . " After all , voting is for sheeple , so they should just ask us libertarians what should happen and then we ' ll tell you all how to live your lives , which is like you know , way different than when we lose elections and we have to live under what people who we didn ' t vote for decide .
