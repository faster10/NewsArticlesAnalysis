Eli the Elephant had been feeling well until a few months ago when he was placed into captivity . He notes that being held in captivity is " somewhat stressful and admits to coping in unhealthy manners , including smoking up to two packs of cigarettes per day , a heavy reliance on fast food chains , and watching too much television . " I got away from my grasses and bark diet , " he commented . When asked about his size , he said that he ' s always been " big boned . "
