We seem to be so addicted to technology . If one person has a new piece of electronic idiocy , then EVERYONE has to have one . Take GPS units for example . GPS stands for Global Positioning Systems , or Government People Spying , I ' m never sure which . The point is just because you can get one of these little techno babies for under two hundred dollars , everybody seems to think they need one . My wife even has one she uses it to mark Hemlock stands that are infested with Wooly Adelgid in the Upper Esopus River Basin here in Ulster County , NY ( actually , I wasn ' t lying at the beginning of this . My wife is a genius and wholly committed to protecting our environment . She ' s just great . ) . But I have a sneaking suspicion that most people who buy these things are just looking to see how far it is from local Wendy ' s to the local McDonalds .
