Of course , both my Dad and I had and have broken some laws in business over the years too that ' s not what I mean . But any laws we skirted didn ' t hurt anyone else . We never took advantage of someone with less than we had to get ahead . You never do that . Never . If you take a job or accept a responsibility , you try your damndest to fulfill it and if doing that puts you in jeopardy , well , then it does . The point is , when you close your eyes for that last time , you have to know , God and heaven be damned , that you did what you believed to be right and good . I guess Dr King knew that better than anyone .
