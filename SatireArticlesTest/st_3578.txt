To Ted from Dave : Ted , " Sarah Jenkins has come up with what sounds like a good name ' SKRATCHNIX ' She said we should make it in tablet form , pink with light blue stripes oval shape . Lab says they can make it out of cornstarch and soy flour at about . 03 cents per unit . We can patent a prescriptive chemical name . How about " tri lipaside3 , sodium pavoside ? " It means nothing , but the USFDA will like it . "
