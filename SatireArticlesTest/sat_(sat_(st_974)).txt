For some , checklists became part of the problem . " I don ' t think we ever actually started a surgery , " said Dr Richard Face , one of the clinic ' s staff general surgeons specializing in inguinal hernia repairs . " We would almost always have to get chest X rays preoperatively to make sure that the patient had lungs before intubation . The radiologist would suggest clinical correlation for a subtle opacity . This meant that we had to use another checklist that would inevitably make us treat for community acquired pneumonia and atypicals with a macrolide , a cephalosporin , vancomycin , gentamicin , rifampin , INH , pyrazinamide , ethambutol , and acyclovir . Patients would then develop complications . We ' d then have to start treatment for C . diff and many times , hemodialysis . "
