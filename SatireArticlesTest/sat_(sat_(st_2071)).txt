He walked into his kitchen and poured himself a glass of his favorite brew before he popped the lid off the bath salts and made his way back to the tub . " I grabbed the book I was reading at the time and intended to have a nice long hot relaxing soak while I finished a couple chapters and enjoyed my beer .

" Eric shrugged it off , finished his beer , shed his clothes and jumped in the the water .
