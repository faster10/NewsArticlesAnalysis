Imagine a situation : a junior congressman faces a boring , six hundred page appropriations bill in which is hidden a scale back in farming subsidies . The bill comes up for a vote in fifteen minutes , and the party leadership has " suggested " he approve it . Local farmers and their families in his district are routinely forced to go to food banks to feed their own families , while the agro businesses that lobbied for the rider are reaping record profits for their stockholders . There will be no line item veto tonight . The power this legislator can unleash with a single word will bring hardship , hopelessness and unforgettable injustice . The air around him will be filled with the cries of hungry children , and he ' ll have to walk right through . Every value he learned as a boy tells him to vote " nay , " to return to negotiations and find another way of greasing the lobbyists . Or , he reasons , he could complete the task and rush back to start popping pills that can , over the course of two weeks , immunize him against a lifetime of crushing remorse . He draws one last clean breath and raises his hand . " Aye , " he says .
