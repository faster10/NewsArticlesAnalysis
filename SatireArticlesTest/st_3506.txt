The Dow Jones Stock market is crashing as I write this at this point down 500 points on news that Republican lawmakers in Congress , by a vote of 226 to 207 , are refusing to go along with the financial rescue package . Oil prices have dropped 10 and all the major international currencies are falling . The fear is now that even if 20 more GOP lawmakers gets their shit together , it would still not be enough to repair the damage they ' ve already caused by their posturing and grandstanding . There is no joke here folks it might just be the end of the world as we know it .
