Even everyday working people are now feeling that The President is one of them . " When The President said if he was elected that he would roll back the tax cuts on the rich and give some tax relief to the poor , he got my vote . " Said trucker Glenn Bobbins . " The talking heads in charge up there now have lost sight of the little guy . Who up there is fighting for us working stiffs ? I know the President is on my side and if he gets up there , he is going to make my life better . "
