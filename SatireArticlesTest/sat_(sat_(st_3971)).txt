The moral of the story ? When you ' re selling your house , the last thing you want to do is annoy your neighbors . Off the top of my head I can think of fifty ways to make their house undesirable without breaking a single rule heck , just having me next door can do it for most people . This is a pretty conservative place and I ' m , well , me . After all , I annoy Conservatives for a hobby and I ' m pretty good at it . I think I ' ll mention to the folks who live on the other side of her that she doesn ' t like their old truck parked in their driveway either , you know , get the whole neighborhood involved .
