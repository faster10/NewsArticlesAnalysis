There ' s no way to debate them , there ' s no way to compromise with them , because what they want and believe is either untrue or indefinable . Barack Obama is not a Communist , or a Fascist or a Socialist , a Muslim , a reverse racist or any of the myriad things the Tea Party members are willing to believe he is . He doesn ' t want to take over American industry or the banks or even the healthcare industry . He does want to control the excesses of these groups , true , and he wants to make healthcare affordable to the more than 45 million people , a lot of which belong to the Tea Party , who don ' t have coverage .
