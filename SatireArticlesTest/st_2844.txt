Thompson wasn ' t there to protest or disturb the Trump event , but all of a sudden , members of the crowd threw a noose around the young man ' s neck and tackled him to the ground . The rope was then thrown over a rafter beam . With the crowd cheering , people began to pull on the rope , but fortunately , it broke . " I think I was lifted two feet and then fell back down , thank God . Then I ran like Hell . It was the fastest I ' ve ever ran said Thompson .
