How did we get into this economic mess ? Not being financially savvy , I try and think of the markets , banks and government in terms that I can understand , as a big , global and dysfunctional family , one with a drinking problem . In this case , the liquor of choice is money . Imagine it this way a few years back when cousin Alan Greenspan ( think of him as an enabler ) headed the Fed , he started lowering interest rates that banks could borrow the money they loan to each other and ultimately to us .
