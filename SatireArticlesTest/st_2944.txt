I appreciate being remembered , but I had lots of better days , right ? Days when I wasn ' t , oh , I don ' t know , shot in the head . I had several of those days , thinking back on it . In fact , I can recall 1 , 035 other days when , as President and Commander in Chief , I wasn ' t shot in the head . June 2 , 1962 . February 20 , 1963 . How about September frigging 9 , 1961 ? Pick one . Any one . I don ' t care .
