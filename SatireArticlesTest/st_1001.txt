While the rest of McSwagger ' s hospitalization was uneventful , except for a confusing moment in which McSwagger was awakened from a deep sleep by his pager , only to find out that he was being called by his own nurse , apparently because he needed something for sleep , the paradox did not end when he left the facility . The mirror paradox , in which patient and physician are both one , really becomes bizarre with patient satisfaction surveys . " I really wasn ' t happy with the care I received , I mean , I had to admit myself . But then I realized , if I let the facility have it , I was just damning myself . I mean , it wasn ' t going to reflect on the surgeon , I was my own attending of record . Would I be saying that I should have done a better job taking care of myself ? I ' m putting my own job in jeopardy if I tell the truth . "
