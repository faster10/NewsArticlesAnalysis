Unnamed White House Source Wegman ( Pudgy ) Waterhouse , speaking on the condition of anonymity said , " I know on the face of it , it seems shocking that we would implicate Senator Clinton . After all , no one has done more for George W . Bush and his rise to power than the Clintons , both Bill and Hillary . And while he ' s grateful for their continuing support , President Bush , as everyone knows , is completely committed to truth in government . Therefore , he ' s decided that it is imperative that anyone who ' s been involved in the naming of Valerie Plame should be exposed , even his closest friend in the world , Hillary Clinton . "
