Hammock started on inpatient wards five days ago and this is his first ward month as a physician . Torres , Damien , and Thomas are just a few of the numerous patients and colleagues who have noted Hammock ' s change in mental status and behavior . He stopped shaving and showering . He was disheveled . His white coat was covered in coffee stains and his pockets were filled with never ending sheets of folded paper full of illegible and incoherent scribble . He never knew the answers . Worse , he never had any questions . In a matter of days , many people realized that Hammock couldn ' t make medical decisions on his own and that someone needed to step in .
