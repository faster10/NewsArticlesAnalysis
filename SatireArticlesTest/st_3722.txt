So you can bitch about her voting record on Iraq or Iran , you can bemoan the state of DC politics and call for a fresh face in Washington all you want . As for me , give me someone who ' s been in the middle of it for decades and who can actually get something done , rather than sit around with some talk show host with weirdly close ties to the Bush Administration and tell you about his hopes and dreams . I don ' t want hopeful platitudes , I want Hillary Clinton .
