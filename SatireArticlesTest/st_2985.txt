Former quarterback Troy Aikman throws a football made from the same material as Bridgestone tires . The football curves wildly , which means defensive back Deion Sanders can ' t make the interception . Seem innocent ? Hardly . Aikman wears jersey number 8 , as in 2008 , when Obama was elected ( and won New " Jersey " ) . Deion wears number 21 , which is like saying , " Hey , everyone who ' s 21 , vote for Obama . " Because they all do . And of course 21 is just 12 reversed , as in the 2012 election . And since Deion loses ' the competition in the commercial , this ad is clearly stating , " Don ' t reverse your vote in 2012 because you ' ll lose . " ( NB : Here ' s a clever subtext they don ' t want you to think about tires are made of rubber . Rubber is another word for contraceptive . Contraceptives are what Obama wants everyone to wear . Even children and old people . )
