As the impromptu press conference was wrapping up , Ryan said to reporters , " Look , at the end of it all , as a Republican the only time I really want or need to bring up family time is when I ' m blowing a racist dog whistle about why black people on average live in and deal with poverty more than white people . As a Republican , I only need to even care about the ' traditional nuclear family ' when I ' m trying to get more votes from evangelical Christians . You can be mad about that all you want but it ' s not going to change any time soon because a whole lot of people vote for my party strictly because they truly believe I look out for the little guy , even when I very clearly and hypocritically don ' t . See ya guys , I need to go work on my pecs in home gym . "
