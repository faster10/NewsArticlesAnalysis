The following scene takes place just before the third act , and is set in Lex Luthor ' s underground laboratory . Superman has leveled the building and is apparently under Brainiac ' s mind control . ( You read that correctly , Brainiac will be in this film ) Batman attempts to stop Superman from killing the badly injured Luthor , who somehow knows Batman ' s secret identity . The two character ' s relationship is ambiguous , but Lex does proclaim his love for Bruce Wayne . We ' re left with a cliff hanger as a red flash zips across the screen , and suddenly Luthor is gone .
