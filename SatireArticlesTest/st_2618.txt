GRACE , TENNESSEE Ammar Abdul Malouf is a 32 year old Syrian who fled his home country to come to America , seeking asylum from the bloody civil war that is ravaging the Syrian countryside . Malouf began his journey to the United States with his wife and young daughter more than 15 months ago , and last Thursday he finally made it to a small town in Tennessee with them all in tow . Unfortunately for Mr Malouf though , Tennessee ' s Governor Bill Haslam ( R ) has joined a chorus of Republican governors and one Democratic governor in stating his intention to keep people like Ammar out of his state .
