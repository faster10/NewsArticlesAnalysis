" If there is a god , for sure he would let me eat bacon . Why would he punish all Muslims for eating bacon ? It tastes so good ! " he asks , visibly angered by the whole affair . " I feel cheated , I don ' t understand why I have been lied to about this for so long , " he told a local radio host . " I eat it every day and feel much happier now that I have bacon in my life , " he added during the radio broadcast , although he also admits to being shunned by many members of his community . " They can ' t understand , they won ' t taste it and so , they will never know what they are missing " he acknowledges , visibly disheartened .
