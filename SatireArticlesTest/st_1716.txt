" We ' ve gone through a lot since the legalization of gay marriage . We ' ll never be the same , " says Martha Palmer . " Our lives have become overrun with sin and chaos . Not a single day has passed since then where I haven ' t engaged with multiple partners , sometimes men but usually women . My husband weeping my husband has been tongue punching Craig Wilson in the fart box every single day . I know they ' re happy together , but they shouldn ' t be . It ' s unnatural . We were married . We were both straight . But once gay marriage became legal , our entire relationship ceased to exist . Tony would come home and try to kiss me , but I ' d know . I ' d smell it , and I would know . Divorce was the only option left to us . "
