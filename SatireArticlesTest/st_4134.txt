We ' re happy to report that Billy has taken care of that little problem we reported on in last years letter . As you no doubt remember the little scamp was facing fifteen to twenty in Attica after he got caught transporting some serious weight across state lines . The poor kid was at his wits end and was all set to flip on his supplier , someone he only knew as ' The Knife ' . Well , in one of those funny family coincidences that show the right hand doesn ' t always know what the left hand is doing , Billy found out that The Knife was actually his dear little Grandma on his moms side , Ethel ( Blade ) Jenkins ! Thank goodness the kid found out in time to avoid some real Christmas hilarity . Who knows where ( or in what foundation ) he would have ended up if Grandma felt enough pressure .
