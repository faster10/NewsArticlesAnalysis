" Just because we ' ve threatened to shut down the government before over different issues doesn ' t mean these aren ' t important , " said Sen . Rand Paul , ( R KY ) . " What about the Civil Rights Act , which outlawed discrimination and led to Barack Obama being President ? That was bad . What about the National Banking Act of 1863 , which created the federal banking system and has the word " federal in it ? Horrible . And the Northwest Ordinance gave us places like Michigan and Ohio , which in the last election voted for Barack Obama . Do I need to explain that to anyone ?
