" Even though most of us have never seen combat and would gladly use our power and connections to make sure our children never saw combat either , " Rubio told reporters after the debate , " that doesn ' t stop us from encouraging Americans to do the right thing die in our places . Answer the call , and be our bullet sponge so that the military industrial complex can keep on humming , and this great socialist experiment known as the United States Armed Forces can continue to rain down democracy and freedom in the form of drone fired missiles forever , and ever , Amen . Praise God , the Republican Party , America , and me ! "
