" We initially started our over the counter campaign for Viagra in support of National Impotence Day in Britain which coincides with Valentine ' s Day on February 14 , " stated Boots spokeswoman Claire Stafford . " We had lots of safety precautions in place , including screenings for blood pressure and consultation with a pharmacist before dispensing Viagra . Then Pfizer found out about our intentions and pointed out that our precautions may scare away some men who might otherwise want to try it . That ' s when they came up with the marketing plan for the lower dose . "
