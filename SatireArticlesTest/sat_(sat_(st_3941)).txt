Still , the question is , is he wrong ? As a Libertarian Tea Partying Republican , shouldn ' t he be applauded for his honesty , finally saying what good old boys been thinking privately for decades now , namely that the country has gone to hell in a hand basket ever since we gave Darkies the right to vote , not mention being able to even talk to White people without first tugging their forelocks and saying " S ' cuse me , Massa " ? Shouldn ' t he be congratulated by members of the Tea Party wing of the Republicans , as led by Sarah Palin , for at least being truthful about it ?
