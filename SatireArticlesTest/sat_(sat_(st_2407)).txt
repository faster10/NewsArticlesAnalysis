Again , from spokesperson Skylar Dodson : " We cannot confirm , or deny , at this time , any implications regarding the identity of Jared Fogle , or of his genetic relationship to anyone , we can only say that a blood test was done , and some kind of DNA bell went off in the computer system that made it spit out a long forgotten , still unsolved case involving an unreported missing child found wandering in a Ventura grocery store in early october 1984 . The child was found without any form of ID . The only clue to the child ' s possible identity could be found in the child ' s underpants , which had the letters " j duggar " written in ballpoint ink on the label at the back . "
