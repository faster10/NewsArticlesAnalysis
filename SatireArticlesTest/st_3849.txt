Shuter admitted that the connection was not good and that he may have gotten some of the quotations wrong . One such quote which he alleges may now have come from Karl Rove and originally reported in the New York Post was : " It ' s one thing to lose your boyfriend to Paris Hilton it ' s another to find her wearing your family jewels . " Shuter now acknowledges that the " anonymous source " might have actually said : " It ' s one thing to lose your boyfriend to Paris Hilton it ' s another to find her doing his family jewels . "
