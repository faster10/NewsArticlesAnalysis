I ' m biased against religious fanatics of any persuasion because I perceive them to be , well , religious fanatics . I ' m biased against George Bush because uh , ok that ' s an obvious one . I have a strong bias against people who think that it ' s necessary to drive an eight cylinder SUV around town as their family car and people who moan about how much they ' ve lost in the stock market while forgetting that they didn ' t do anything to actually earn that money in the first place . I ' m biased against people who invoke the name of God as a justification for going out and bombing innocent people , ours or theirs , ( and these are not just the religious fanatics either remember , there is no cause that can be considered holy that involves killing people it may be right and just or just wrong , but it ain ' t holy . ) In a related vein , I ' m biased against people who consider Islam or Christianity or Judaism , Hinduism , Shintoism or any other ism you can think of as a " religion of peace " . No religion is peaceful . None . Except maybe Unitarianism . I ' ve never heard of a Unitarian Holy War . But maybe that ' s next week .
