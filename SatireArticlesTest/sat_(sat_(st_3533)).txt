Business studies rarely consider the conditions of employees . Priority is given to what ' s best for business in studies by Fortune Magazine , The Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council , the Tax Foundation and the Cato Institute . Although these studies radically disagree in the ranking of states , they generally consider low taxes , low wages and lack of government regulation as beneficial . Conversely , union wages and worker ' s rights are considered bad for business . Congress appears to be in sympathy with such pro business views , as it recently defeated a minimum wage increase from 5 . 15 ( or 10 , 712 per year ) , where it has been stuck since September 1997 .
