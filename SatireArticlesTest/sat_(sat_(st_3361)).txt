So it boils down to this : during his campaign , President Obama bemoaned the decline of America ' s standing in the world , accusing George Bush , Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld ' s ' go it alone ' style for that decline . But now , when foreign countries like China , Saudi Arabia and Micronesia are finally taking an interest in America and contributing millions of dollars to the GOP ( A caveat I don ' t know if these three countries in particular are finally taking an interest in America and contributing to the GOP , because that ' s the point : Freedom of Speech should be hidden . That ' s the law . I mean , you all say anything you want on the web and don ' t use your real names . This is the same thing , but just with shadowy foreign governments and corporations and millions of dollars . Just because you don ' t have millions of dollars or have a shadowy foreign government or corporation to buy your own politician with is your own damn fault . ) , President Obama suddenly flip flops on the issue and is demanding accountability . Jeez . Some people .
