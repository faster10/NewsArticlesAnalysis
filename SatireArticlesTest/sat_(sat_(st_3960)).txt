As to Republican party ' s chances for the coming presidential election year , Rove had this to say : " It ' s looking really good right now , believe it or not . Our candidate is way ahead in the polls . We may not need to even touch the race card this year , and running a campaign against a cuckolded wife should be a breeze . I think we have a real shot at retaining the White House and taking back both houses of Congress as the insurgency in Iraq is squelched through the president ' s strong leadership . "
