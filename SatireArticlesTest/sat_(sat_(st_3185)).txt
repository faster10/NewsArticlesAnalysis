Beschloss said U . S . presidents have a long and contentious relationship with slumber . Bill Clinton went to bed often but not to sleep while Ronald Reagan actually slept through his entire eight years in office . President Franklin D . Roosevelt hung his head for long periods during the Great Depression , although aides insisted he was not sleeping but just " very very sad . " Millard Fillmore slept often as a means to forget even for a few hours that his parents named him Millard . Throughout Abraham Lincoln ' s presidency , he rarely found sleep as he was plagued by the waking national nightmare that was Mary Todd Lincoln . Founding Father Thomas Jefferson rarely slept when having a lie down as he found slave beds uncomfortable , while Richard Nixon never dozed off on the principle that " evil never sleeps . "
