But a good old fashioned nuclear winter will take care of global warming and as we ' ve seen in Chernobyl , depopulating irradiated areas is really good for nature as a whole . No humans means more animals . ( Author ' s Note : Wow , this is really turning into something I can ' t believe I ' m not even thinking about it as I write it ) . Of course , we don ' t want America to get nuked , Texas excluded of course . Let ' s face it , you can only take the concept of ' America First ' so far , so we ' ll have to pre empt those countries by striking first , without warning . A Thursday after I ' m sworn in would be good . Around five in the morning , local time . I know , I know , we ' ll lose a lot of swag if we blow these guys up , but with great profit comes some sacrifice . But we can still rob all their banks since bank assets are just computer code anyway and their gold reserves should be shielded from the worst of the fall out , once again sending half the take back to the government . That ' s really only fair , especially if we ' re supplying our people with the guns and ammo , and America is all about fairness . "
