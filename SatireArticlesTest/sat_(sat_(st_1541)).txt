FLUSHING MEADOWS , WISCONSIN Failed 2016 Republican presidential candidate Scott Walker also happens to be the governor of the State of Wisconsin . Walker is one of the over 20 governors who have decided they would like to keep refugees from the war torn country of Syria out of their respective states . Federal authorities have been quick to point out the supremacy of the Constitution and how that supremacy means governors technically don ' t have the legal authority to turn away anyone the feds approve . One atheist in Walker ' s state however , says she is going to push him to keep a different group of religious fundamentalists from flooding into Wisconsin .
