These efforts may be noble , well intentioned and admirable , but they don ' t come close to preventing global warming , which is much worse that we think . Take for example the prediction that if everyone in the US rode bicycles , the Chinese closed their factories and Europe returned to candles , global warming would continue for centuries . If the rest of the world returned to the Stone Age , carbon concentrations would continue to rise because carbon doesn ' t dissipate quickly about half of it is absorbed by the oceans and plants , and the other half lingers in the atmosphere .
