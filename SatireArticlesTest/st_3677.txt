The Paige family ' s lawyer , Ronald L . Barr , is extremely interested in trying this case . " The Brothers Grimm have for far too long spread false pieces of information about animals and their activities . I have studied their so called events and have discovered that not only do they tell little girls that they can find their prince if they kiss a frog , but that step mothers are wicked and make you sleep in the ashes , a little man will turn straw into gold for you if you give him your first child , but if you guess his name the deal is off , and that wolves will eat your rural living grandmother if you go to visit her . These men loved telling lies to children . I hope they ' re paying for their sins in the afterlife . " The frog in question offered no comments .
