My wife strolls smugly inside as I race to the far side of the lot before one of these SUV Valkyries tosses a shopping cart through my windshield . Envy is an ugly thing . I creep into the store unnoticed as the paramedics and police arrive and attempt to deal with yet another round of grocery store hooliganism . Once inside I don ' t immediately see my wife , mostly since I ' m not looking for her , so I grab a cart and head for the Bulk Purchase aisle . I choose that aisle because it ' s the widest and least traveled , which was perfect for my needs . I break into a run , and gathering momentum , leap in the air with the aim of jumping up onto the rear axle of the cart and taking a ride .
