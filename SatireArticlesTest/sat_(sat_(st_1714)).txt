The Palmers ' fiasco began on October 9th , 2014 , just two days after a federal judge legalized gay marriage in their state . According to documents filed with the lawsuit , legalized gay marriage forced Tony , apparently against his will , to engage in an act of fellatio with his neighbor , Craig Wilson , moments after returning a lawnmower Palmer had borrowed . Palmer and Wilson were both arrested after neighbors called police to report the two men were engaging in the deviant sex act on Wilson ' s lawn , in broad daylight , though some reports claim they poorly attempted to hide behind a tree on the property .
