So right now I ' m in Atlanta and I can get a flight for late Sunday but I look at my calendar and no I can ' t because I got the cable guy coming first thing Monday . Well , I say first thing . I don ' t know actually because they say they ' ll be there sometime between 8 a . m . and 1 p . m . Like I have time to sit around all day ! And then the plumber is supposed to come . He said Monday or Tuesday . Or Wednesday . " ' So I can ' t book a flight because you just know I ' ll pick the wrong day and I will not pay a change fee for the flight . No way . And Friday is out because I have a doctor ' s appointment . For my physical . I know I could do Thursday but that ' s the day before my physical and if you wanna know I get kinda nervous about doctors and if I did my Apocalypse thing my head wouldn ' t be in it . And I can ' t reschedule the appointment because my internist books like a year ahead . And I can ' t just skip it because I did that with my last two . I told you , I get nervous .
