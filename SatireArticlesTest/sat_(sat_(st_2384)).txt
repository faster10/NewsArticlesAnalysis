One source close to Sen . Ted Cruz ' s office said that Cruz is " hopping mad " but " tolerant " of the idea that the Pope " blew off the most important people in the country members of congress " to dine with homeless people , but leaving a negative review on Yelp was " a bridge too far . " Cruz said he will immediately launch a full scale Senate investigation into whether or not the Pope was acting on his own authority , or if he was taking orders from somewhere else . The 2016 Republican presidential candidate isn ' t the only one smelling a conspiracy though .
