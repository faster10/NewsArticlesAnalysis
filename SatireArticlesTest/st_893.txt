Even the entertainment options were disappointing to McElroy . " The TV did have cable and there was free Wi fi , I ' ll give them that , " she said . " But the remote was hanging on some cord and plugged into a wall ( SOOO annoying , again ) . But the Wi fi was painfully slow , and blocked my online gambling website . And there was no HBO , no premium channels I missed five episodes of Game of Thrones ! And don ' t even get me started on the lack of on demand adult entertainment channels . "
