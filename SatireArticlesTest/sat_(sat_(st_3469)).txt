Anyway , Cindy Sheehan has already achieved her goal just by being denied it . Neat trick . She ' s exposed George W . Bush as a coward , brought attention to the fact that there is no answer to her original question , now lost in all the rhetoric from both sides namely , what exactly is the reason we ' re in Iraq ? In other words , just what is the Noble Cause that everyones been dying for ? And most amazingly of all , she ' s gotten America to actually pay attention . I honestly didn ' t think anyone could do that .
