COLE08 : I ' m sitting here frozen to the spot , trembling slightly . Very pale . DRMALCOLM : What is it ? What do you see ? COLE08 : I see three adults . Not so old . They are hanging around an office . They are waving their stock options in my face . The stock options are all wet . I don ' t understand . DRMALCOLM : Those wet stock options would mean their options are what they call " under water . " It means , basically , their stock is worthless . COLE08 : Great . Now I ' ve got all this water on me . I ' m soaked . People will think I did it to myself or my mom did it . Make them leave . DRMALCOLM : I ' m working on it . Any word on Salon ?
