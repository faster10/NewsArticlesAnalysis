" At first I didn ' t know what I could possibly contribute to a hospital , " reports Chastity , a newly hired consultant for the emergency department . " I mean , it was intimidating at first to be advising a hospital operation . But then you realize that there are a lot of similarities between what they do , and what I do . I mean , you ' re basically dealing with a bunch of desperate people waiting to have their names called so they can get roomed . You bring them back , you lay them on a bed , and then you give them what they need . There ' s really very little difference at all . "
