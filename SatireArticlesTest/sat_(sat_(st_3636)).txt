" It was only a matter of time before these two really capitalized on their recent successes and headed to the big time . " Says Hollywood insider Mo Roche . " I got a chance to see the rough cut of the film and I gotta tell ya , that Dick Cheney is a riot . You wouldn ' t know it from looking at him , but he is funny and charming and sweet , even when he is accidentally shooting innocent Iraqis in the back . I loved the film and I think it is going to be big in America . I don ' t think it ' s going to play so well overseas , but the producers tell me they think it will be a global smash . "
