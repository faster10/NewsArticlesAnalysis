Maltin further complained about how selfish celebrities and corporations are : " They could be giving so much of their money to worthy causes , but instead they hoard it for themselves , and for what ? If there were a place where I could buy jeans that I would know were somehow helping people somewhere in the world , then I would totally shop there . But without that kind of leadership , I guess all the money I spend on myself will just go into the pockets of the rich until someone with a heart and a conscience steps up and starts trying to make a difference . "
