Neither the Clinton team or the spokesperson for Chairwoman of the Democratic Party Debbie Wasserman Schultz would comment on this report , though Cheryl Whittier , spokesperson for Jeb ' s father , former President George H . W . Bush , did say that people had been talking about this for years ever since Hillary Clinton lost the Democratic nomination for President to Barack Obama in 2008 . " It wasn ' t suppose to happen that way , " according to Whittier . " Obama screwed up the families ' plan back in ' 08 . This time , he ' s out of the picture for good . Old plans had to be readjusted , but this may be even better according to what Mrs ( Barbara ) Bush was saying the other day . Eight ( years ) for the Clintons , then eight for the Bushes . " ' Then who knows ? Chelsea and George ( Jeb ' s son ) might want to keep the empire alive a bit longer they could have babies together . They ' re both very good looking . Those would be some gorgeous children . "
