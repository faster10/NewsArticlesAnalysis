The fan speculation does make a great deal of sense . Typically shows that a network wants to keep around don ' t get preempted or shuffled from their time slots . Putting ' CSI ' in direct competition against AMC ' s ' The Walking Dead ' and Fox ' s ' Family Guy ' did not make sense to most fans of the show and many feel it was set up to fail . Also choosing to air the program in a time slot routinely interrupted by sports would not bode well for ratings success .
