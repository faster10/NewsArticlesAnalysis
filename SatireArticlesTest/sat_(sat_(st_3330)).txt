The President , his face flushed in anger , said , " We will retaliate in kind ! Our undercover operatives in Iraq and Afghanistan are preparing to poison the terrorist ' s camels . They will have no milk to drink , or camel droppings to cook their shish kabobs over . We are freezing the bank accounts of all Iranian companies doing business here , and the money will be used to purchase new pets to replace those which were cowardly destroyed . It ' s a good thing that Barnie ( President ' s dog ) was not affected . I would not have hesitated to press the red button on my desk and wipe the Middle East off the map ! "
