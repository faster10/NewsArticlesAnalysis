" Leave all that fancy , show offy , fundamental stuff like making a beautiful spike right into the face of a defenseless opponent to the rookies and bench warmers with nothing to lose , " said team Captain Erika Reynolds . " You don ' t really need to do anything impressive to win unless you ' re playing a worthy opponent , so why bother going out on a limb and risk missing a tough shot and look bad ? It ' s much better to do just enough to win while distancing yourself from any mistakes on the court , which can always be blamed on the ref favoring the other team anyway . "
