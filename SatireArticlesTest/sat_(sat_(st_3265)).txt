Some of you have approached me about Blake ' s behaviour in the past couple days and expressed some concerns , and I wanted to let all of you know that I have heard these concerns loud and clear . Karen , you told me last week that you were made uncomfortable by the way that Blake walks on all fours and lets his torso hang closely to the ground . I think that on the one hand , we can all understand where Blake is coming from when he does this : it gives him the ability to be as low as possible , and for that I think he deserves to be applauded .
