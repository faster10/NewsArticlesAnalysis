Odd though . These are the same people by and large who elected a president to two terms , a president who took the largest budget surplus this country has ever seen ( at least in modern times ) and gave it all away . Then , when their was no money left , he reduced people ' s taxes to ensure there ' s be even less money in the future . Once that was done he suddenly found himself forced to borrow ( mostly from Communist China , our supposed enemy ) enough money to fight not one but two wars ( one of which he started without provocation and going so far as to manufacture evidence to justify it ) at the same time , increased government intrusion by allowing warrant less wiretapping , openly advocated the use of torture as a legitimate interrogation tool and a whole host of other things , including mandatory testing for children before they could graduate .
