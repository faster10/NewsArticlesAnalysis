Actually , not quite . I did find myself watching The History Channel a lot . Well , that and some fashion network that consistently featured really tall , thin girls in very little clothing that reminded me of the heroin addicts of my NYC days , but that ' s enough about that . Anyway , THC ( I just now realized about those initials ) had a program about finding the true birth date of Jesus Christ . Apparently , through astronomical research and careful scrutiny of the mathematics used by the bright sparks who developed the Gregorian calendar , Jesus was actually born on April 7 , in the year 6 BC . Or at least it was thereabouts right as they were saying the date I switched back to the thin addict model channel and got distracted . At any rate , according to these heathen know it alls , Jesus was a Springtime baby , not a Winter one . This led me to thinking about Christmas sales . Actually it got me thinking about the Happy Holliday Merry Christmas issue that so rightly occupies America ' s collective mind this time of year . What got me thinking about Christmas sales was my families incredibly avaricious shopping lists and how I could possibly afford it all .
