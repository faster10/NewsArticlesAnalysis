In the late ' 70s and ' 80s , the musical Evita , loosely based on the rise of political leader Eva Per n , wife of Argentinian dictator Juan Per n , ran for over 1 , 500 performances on Broadway . Producers are betting big bucks that similarities between Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton , and the spendthrift , popular , and power hungry " Evita " Per n will be a strong enough gimmick to bolster box office receipts , at least long enough to recoup their multi million dollar investment .
