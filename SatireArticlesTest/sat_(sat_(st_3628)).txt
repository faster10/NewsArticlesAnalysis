Bush : You ' re welcome . As you probably know I was over in Europe last month sort of hobnobbing with the leaders there , doing a lot of hard work with treaties and negotiations and decisions and such . I ' m proud to say that we ' ve come a long way in restoring a lot of relationships , especially with the French . It was suggested that I might want to read this book to understand their culture . I must say , I think they make a little more sense to me now .
