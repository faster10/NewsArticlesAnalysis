Surgical intern Mike Granger has been on a tear this season , completing 100 of his progress notes while showing complete mastery of surgical knots . Veteran surgical oncologist Rick Foster remains a surprise disappointment , leading the league with 6 incomplete surgeries and 4 patients intercepted by internal medicine . In the ED , intern Brittany Rivers has demonstrated her cool under pressure , successfully resuscitating 8 out of 15 patients in the past 10 days without showing any signs of slowing down . First year cardiology fellow Jacob Johnson has underperformed because of his conservative management , bringing in few fantasy points . A better choice is co fellow Jared Turner , who has a stellar 0 . 973 SPR ( stent to patient ratio ) since starting in late August . Ten year hospitalist Henry Edelman has had a horrific start to his 2014 campaign , marred by the league ' s worst readmission rate of 98 . The signs were there early when he missed training camp and showed up all of July without a stethoscope . Do not be surprised if he is demoted back to the minor leagues or residency . Hot : Granger , Rivers , Turner . Not : Foster , Johnson , Edelman .
