Meanwhile , the parents of the bullied student , who also asked to not be identified , say they ' re against the school ' s mandate . " We don ' t want anyone to believe what we believe . We don ' t want to change minds or force people to pray to our God , " says the girl ' s father . " We came to this country to escape the tyranny and oppression in our native land . We came seeking economic prosperity and the American Dream . We respect all other cultures and our neighbors . What they did to our daughter was unfortunate , but it does not warrant punishing an entire school . "
