" His story was clearly one of the most fascinating that I have ever heard , " said FBI director , James Corney . " Mr Anderson not only claims to have killed President Lincoln , but also 32 others , including at least twelve are not even born yet . I know that conspiracy theorists will accuse us of covering up Lincoln ' s murder and stuff like that , but the FBI isn ' t going to open an investigation . I don ' t think this man killed anyone , I think he just lost contact with reality . "
