" When you call something ' retarded ' , what you ' re saying is , ' This thing is deficient somehow , ' " he explained . " But spiritually superior mentally disabled people aren ' t deficient they ' re special , which is why we no longer call them ' retarded ' . But when you call something retarded , we know that you ' re thinking of our special friends , even though we don ' t call them retarded anymore . Which is fine , because there ' s nothing wrong with thinking of them , because they ' re special . But that ' s not how you ' re thinking of them . You ' re thinking of their disabilities , which don ' t exist . "
