The State of Colorado made headlines this week when it became the first state in the history of the U . S . to collect more revenue from marijuana sales taxation than from tax receipts generated by alcohol sales . During the fiscal year 2014 to 2015 , Colorado pot sales netted the state nearly 70 million in taxes , while during the same time frame sales from alcohol brought the state roughly 42 million in tax revenue . In fact , the sales of marijuana generated so much in tax revenue that for one day , September 16th , 2015 , there would be no sales tax on marijuana within the state .
