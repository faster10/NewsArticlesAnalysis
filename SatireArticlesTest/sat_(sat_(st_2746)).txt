The reporter attempted to ask a question , but Trump cut him off , continuing . " This is a serious problem . I ' m not saying Obama controls the media , but come on . Who else thinks terrorists are nice ? Who else thinks ISIS is full of nice people ? Obama wants to let in all of these Islamic savages , these terrorists , these ISIS people , because he thinks they ' re nice people . He thought this terrorist attack you people suffered through was nice . When I make America great again , we ' re going to stop being nice to all these terrorists . Terrorists won ' t get any free rides when I ' m your president . Not in America , not in France , not anywhere , okay ? Not anywhere . "
