When the whistles of amazement and soft murmurings of " Poor Hasharam " fade away , Hasharam himself , who has sat listening respectfully , stands up on two good legs to clear the air . " No Kalil , I am sorry , but I saw no swordfish , " he says . " Only marsh reeds . And sand . But I heard that you , Kalil , found a 40 pound lobster in one of your pots , and when you cut open its belly , you found inside a Great White Shark , still alive , that bit off your head ! "
