And on to healthcare , the big bugaboo of the day , the example of everything that ' s wrong with this new Administration . At the beginning of 2009 when Barack Obama took office somewhere between forty and fifty million people had no coverage , or around 15 of the entire population , and more were losing it everyday due to job losses and just being priced out of the market . Not poor , starving homeless and Welfare cases , regular Americans with children . Costs were spiraling out of control , taking up about 17 of GDP ( by example , both Iraq and Afghanistan together cost around 4 6 of GDP . ) . Yet for some strange reason , giving 15 of the nation access to not free , but just affordable , healthcare has come to represent nearly everything that ' s wrong with America today , even though I suspect a great many of these same protesters will benefit from it . Which bring us to the " Tea Party " .
