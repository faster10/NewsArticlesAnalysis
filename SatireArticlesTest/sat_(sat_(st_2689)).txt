West says the Roman gladiators inspired Gladiator TV . " We ' re hoping to stylize the network after Roman gladiator fights , but with a few modern twists . Fighters will face off in an arena , on sand . They ' ll use Greco Roman weaponry , including swords , shields , nets , tridents , and spears . But the stadium will have world class medical facilities and an experienced team of paramedics , doctors , and surgeons . These fights might end in death , but they don ' t necessarily have to . "
