This is not to suggest that we saw no value in your book . We particularly enjoyed the parables that you say Jesus recited at the bar , such as the one about the three blind rabbis , or the one that ends with the man telling his wife " Liquor ? I hardly know her . " While these stories do amuse , we are not convinced that they convey any unique insights into the message that Jesus was trying to impart . Especially the account of the martyr crossing the road we are quite sure we ' ve heard that one before .
