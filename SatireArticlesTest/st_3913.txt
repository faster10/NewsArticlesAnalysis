Hilton plans on filming the trip for a possible reality show , " The Philanthropist Wore Gucci " . Hilton will be visiting a number of villages with a " model boot camp " for potential tweens and teens . " I think I ' m going to start small . Maybe have the girls just walk a few steps , so they don ' t pass out . Then we ' ll move on to more involved things , like when I used to have Tinkerbell in my purse , except we may have to improvise with that , like use a goat in a sack . "
