As always , my music warnings are presented with a plea to parents to review their son ' s and daughter ' s activities and choices of entertainment . Please do not allow them to listen to this band . A thorough search of their ipod devices and laptop Bing histories will reveal such choices . If any music from Black Sabbath is found to be consumed by your children , it is your responsibility as a parent to immediately destroy the media and call your local church to arrange for counseling . Worst case scenarios call for the expulsion of demons from their bodies through holy ritual .
