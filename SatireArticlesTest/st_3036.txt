Witnesses say the President was walking across the South Lawn in the early evening when Kinzinger , along with classmates Kevin Yoder of Kansas and Reid Ribble of Wisconsin , jumped out of the bushes and pulled Obama ' s trousers around his ankles . The President reportedly offered to compromise by pantsing himself , but the pranksters said they were under strict orders not to work with the administration . A fourth Representative , Ann Marie Buerkle of New York , snapped a photo with her iPhone and immediately posted it on Facebook as proof they had accomplished the task .
