" Even though we don ' t expect them to do anything , I like our residents to feel a sense of accomplishment , so if I ' m installing a new program , I let them participate . For instance , when the program is done loading , there will be a screen that says ' Installation successful . Click OK to continue ' . I could do that myself , but instead I ' ll turn to the resident and say , ' So , what do you think we should do here ? ' "
