So far , we ' ve been talking about what words mean , but we haven ' t stopped to ask what it means to have meaning . Does a word have meaning any more than a star ?

Do the definitions and formalisms in this article validly represent anything within the ever evolving collective consciousness of Western society ? Humankind ? What does it mean to be a man , Jennifer ? What does it mean to be a woman ? What does it mean to be sexist ? What does it mean to be an article ? What did Jennifer mean when she said " I ' m leaving you " ? Was Jennifer joking ? Jennifer if you ' re reading this I m sorry for the love fo god take me back i am so lonely pls . '
