Mid terms , mid terms , mid terms very few regular Americans are actually thinking about them it ' s always that way . The states that are going to elect a governor , like California and New York are , but still even then not that much . Only a handful of registered voters , which are only a relatively minute portion of the population as a whole , are going to vote in November . Only the most politically motivated people vote in the mid terms . Most people can ' t name their congressman or woman or state senator or even know what district they live in . And yet , this is probably the most important mid term election since 1994 , the year of Newt Gingrich ' s " Contract With America " . Why ? Because , like 1994 , this election is about how to thwart a President .
