After the year , we calculated what we would ' ve paid for the various tests and appointments , including an MRI we paid for ourselves because it was a pre existing condition total cost , about 5 , 000 . 00 . So Blue Cross cost us 35 more than if we had just paid for it ourselves , lots more if you deduct the MRI . Of course , if something was indeed wrong with one us , it would ' ve been worth it . But to keep insurance on a regular basis over ten years would ' ve cost 75 , 000 . 00 , very nearly two years worth of my income . I don ' t make enough to spend 20 of my income for health insurance .
