Senator Ted Cruz ( R TX ) said on the campaign trail Wednesday morning that he was " relatively pleased " with Ryan ' s facial expressions during the address , but he would have liked to see him at least hold up a sign that said " Obamacare is the Devil and Liberals Hate America , or something like that . " Cruz said when he ' s elected this fall , he ' ll sign an executive order the first day dictating that Ryan only smile broadly and give a thumbs up gesture to everything Cruz says in his own State of the Union addresses .
