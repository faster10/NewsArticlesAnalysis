Yes , the concept that there should be no governmentally mandated equality at all has merit if you don ' t like someone ' s politics or religion or lineage , not to mention skin , hair or eye color , you shouldn ' t have to serve them . This goes for hospitals , doctors , police and firemen and garbage collectors as well as private businesses , because a true Libertarian shouldn ' t want any tax paid public services like cops or firemen . Everything should theoretically be privately owned or funded by voluntary contributions . Of course , that works both ways .
