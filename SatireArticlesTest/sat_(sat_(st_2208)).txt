" I personally would have said 12 , if it had been up to me , " said Valerie Mullen Pletcher , Chief Development Officer of the Brady Campaign Center To Prevent Gun Violence . " But that 100 , 000 donation from the NRA helped me re think the frankly outdated notion that the 2nd Amendment doesn ' t apply to America ' s young people the same as it applies to adults . That was clearly the intent of our Founding Fathers . "
