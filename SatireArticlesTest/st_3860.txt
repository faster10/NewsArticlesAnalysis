President George W . Bush ' s fence mending trip to Europe is going swimmingly . Speaking to French President Jacques Chirac , Mr Bush suggested that Mr Chirac should visit him at his Texas ranch . " I need a good cowboy , " joked the American President . Mr Chirac , the leader of one of the most urbane countries in Europe , smiled politely at Mr Bush ' s attempt at humor then , when no one was looking , spit on his shoes . Mr Bush is in Europe to beg once again for NATO help in Iraq . This time however , the White House is ready to offer concessions : the President is prepared to say whatever he needs to in order to secure foreign aid while continuing to do whatever he wants , such as threaten to lay a Liberation on Iran .
