Forsythe says " Battlefront " players will be given three free spawns per round , but once a player ' s character has died those three times , they won ' t be able to rejoin the map until the round is over , unless they buy more spawns . " Each new spawn is only twenty five cents . We modeled it after arcade games from the 1980 ' s and 1990 ' s . That twenty five cents will buy you another two spawns . And you can pay an additional twenty five cents to speed up your spawn timer , too , so spawning back in only takes three seconds , as opposed to having to wait the full sixty seconds . "
