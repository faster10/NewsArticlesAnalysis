As for Delaware , I can ' t believe ( well , I really don ' t want to believe ) that Christine O ' Donnell can ensnare the hearts and minds of an entire state that would take some kind of magic spell . But Ms . O ' Donnell swears she ' s not a witch and I truly believe her I ' ve met at least a dozen Wiccans and they all cited ' The Rule Of Three ' : Whatever you put into the world , positive or negative , you ' ll get back three times . Witches are very careful to put out only good thoughts and feelings . So while I applaud her commercials saying she ' s not a witch that ' s good for witches everywhere I worry a bit that she thinks instead now that she ' s everyone in Delaware .
