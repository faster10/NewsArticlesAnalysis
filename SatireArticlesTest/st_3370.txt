At his afternoon press conference , White House Press Secretary Robert " Bob " Gibbs was asked about Vice President Biden ' s statement . " Clearly , the Vice President did not mean he doubts President Obama ' s ability to accomplish his goals . The ' Yes we can ? ' was meant to underscore the dialogue that needs to happen between two people to get things going . In that sense , the Vice President was using the Socratic dialogue he has with the President as an object lesson to both sides of the aisle of Congress to get things done . ' Yes we can ? ' leads to ' Yes , we can ! ' "
