WYOMING An independent study has found a statistical link between menthol cigarette smoking and the incidence of urban gang related violence in the US . Data collected from Baltimore , Detroit , Compton California , and other regions where gang activity and menthol cigarette consumption is high , was compared and contrasted against crime statistics and cigarette sales figures from Altoona Pennsylvania , Bismarck North Dakota , Dubuque Iowa , Portland Oregon , and Lewiston Maine areas where menthol cigarette intake and gang violence barely registers as a blip on the national radar .
