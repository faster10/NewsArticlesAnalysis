Another reporter asked the republican Senator from Texas if he still planned to repeal Obamacare if he wins in 2016 . " I ' m not I ' m pretty sure that ' s still going to happen . Our experience was a fluke , I think . We know that most people , most Obamacare users , they don ' t have this kind of experience with the exchanges . I need to do some more research into it , but as it stands , yes , we ' re going to repeal it on day one when I ' m president . "
