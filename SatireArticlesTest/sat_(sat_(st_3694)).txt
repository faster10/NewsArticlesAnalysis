Gonzales : I ' m glad you asked that . The Department of Justice has been stretched a little thin with the ongoing defense err prosecution of Scooter Libby and other possible defendants in the White House CIA leak case . People must also realize that the Padilla case is like a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle in which the pieces really don ' t fit . It takes a lot of hard foot and upper body work to whip these pieces into shape and make them fit . Having America attacked again just because we wasted time with trying to assemble a puzzle together correctly and " by the rules " is simply not a risk this administration is willing to take .
