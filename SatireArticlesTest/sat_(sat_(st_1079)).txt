" We believe that OD 2020 is not very accommodating , " further explains NASA astronomer Christopher Schlemm . " Despite the volcano and lava , the planet appears to be very gelatinous . Unlike our Earth , which is made up of the crust , mantle , outer core , and inner core , OS 2020 is made up of a cornea , anterior and posterior chambers , and vitreous . Finally , though we haven ' t found it yet , we believe OD 2020 to have a Great Blind Spot , similar to Jupiter ' s Great Red Spot . "
