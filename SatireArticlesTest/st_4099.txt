For doctors , the drugs present a tricky dilemma . Most people exposed to horrific situations don ' t end up with PTSD , but there are few means of knowing on the spot who might need treatment much further down the line . Patients are supposed to take CSD ' s soon after ruthless or shameful behavior . There is evidence , however , that CSD abusers tend to try to curb normal emotional responses by taking the drugs beforehand so that pangs of conscience don ' t impede their performance . Having thus unplugged their conscience before committing a morally repugnant act , they are not subject to remorse afterwards or " the full sting of self examination . "
