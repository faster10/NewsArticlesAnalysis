As the press conference was ending , Priebus reiterated his defense of Trump and Cruz saying , " Ted and Donald are speaking to a very real truth that hating all Muslims is the only path to peace . Hating all Muslims is clearly the most grown up and productive way to target your understandable outrage at a much , much , much smaller subset of the whole of the world ' s Islamic community . After all , you know how much we American Republican Christians just love being blamed for every single abortion clinic or Federal building in Oklahoma that ' s bombed , right ? So the same shit applies here , obviously . All Muslims are untrustworthy because a handful of them committed heinous acts , just like all Christians are terrible human beings because of what Timothy McVeigh did . Get it ? Got it ? Good . "
