Banks , who is currently in her mid 30 ' s , has demonstrated a progressively precarious grasp on reality in recent months . One notable instance involved Banks breaking down during aninterview with Hot 97 , claiming she had invented hip hop , and now people were trying to " steal " her creation . Of course , this is a blatant falsehood , as the term " hip hop " and the style of music it defines was coined in the early 80 ' s , during which time Banks was only 5 years old .
