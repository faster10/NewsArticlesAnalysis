" I think it ' s more complicated than that , " said Dr Joel Saper , director of the Michigan Head Pain and Neurological Institute in Ann Arbor , Michigan , who was not involved in the study . " I ' ll be the first to admit that when I ' m dealing with patients , I get annoyed . Patients are idiots i . e . , they don ' t follow directions , they ' re fat and loud , I really hate them , and so on . But just because they annoy the shit out of me doesn ' t mean I ' ll automatically get a migraine . "
