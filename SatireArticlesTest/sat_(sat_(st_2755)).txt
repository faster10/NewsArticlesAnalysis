Mr Trump said he felt " threatened " by the " high fallutin ' , multi syllable words " the Imam was using so he did " what any other American would do " and he " lashed out with hyperbolic levels of violence . " Trump said he and his team had " done all the research " and found that originally the Constitution had a " taco punch clause " that would give any " powerful , rich , white land owning male " the right to " punch a negroid person or person of any other dark skin tone or differing religious belief as the powerful , rich , white land owner " if the that powerful , rich , white land owner felt threatened or intimidated in any way .
