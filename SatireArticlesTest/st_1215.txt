In an unprecedented delivery , just 3 pushes while standing , Hannah pushed her baby out . Miraculously there was no tear and moments later , the after birth was removed , and sent to pathology ( hopefully not to the hospital cafeteria ) . Hannah straightened up , switched hands , and continued to retract . Her attending Dr Jim Alexander complained , " Your exposure has been terrible ! Okay now it is a little better , " referring to the 10 minutes she was in labor that went unnoticed . " Hannah , you need to anticipate my next move and be aware of your surroundings ! " He went on to constructively criticize her .
