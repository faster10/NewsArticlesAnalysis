The Bush Administration , unable to decide which new war the American people would support , is backing off Iran and North Korea for a week or so in order to blame Syria for the car bombing that killed former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hairiri . Unnamed White House Source Wegman ( Pudgy ) Waterhouse , speaking on the condition of anonymity said , " We in the Administration are committed to keeping the American people safe and to that end we are just as committed to attacking someone anyone during this term . I personally like North Korea , but Donny ( Secretary of De ( fe ) nse Donald Rumsfeld ) thinks Syria would be more fun . I don ' t know , maybe he ' s right . Taking over Syria would give us some great beach front property in Lebanon essentially for free , which is nice . Plus , North Korea doesn ' t have shit in the way of natural resources . "
