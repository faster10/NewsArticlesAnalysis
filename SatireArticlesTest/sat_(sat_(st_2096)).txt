For decades the conservative majority has expressed nothing but hatred and disdain towards homosexuals and gay culture . Fortunately , progressive liberal reasoning has gained predominance which has enabled those of us within educational systems to re educate and replace many of the antiquated ways in which people perceive homosexuals and their allies . The Obama administration has opened up so many doors for us and I look forward to propelling this agenda forward . My goal is to make homosexuality the commonly accepted norm . I won ' t rest until there ' s an out of the closet homosexual in every family ! "
