Oh , well I guess it ' s a sink or swim world . Maybe one day we ' ll all be able to look to look back on this and laugh . Even though I can ' t go to the store or for a walk without being mobbed by the press , which has turned my home into a prison , at least my wife and I are together . I made a promise to both her and myself , that I ' ll keep fighting to clear myself as long as I have a breath in my body , but until then I have my pictures to paste in my scrapbook , and we rent a lot of videos too .
