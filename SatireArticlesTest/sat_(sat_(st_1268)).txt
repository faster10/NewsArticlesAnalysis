When it was recommended by Dr Herb Eaversmells , a local gastroenterologist , that she try to wean herself off of narcotics since they were only exacerbating her problem , she replied , " I ' m never seeing you again . I can ' t live without my Percocets , fentanyl patches , and IV Dilaudid . Get out of my room now , you quack . You are starting to upset my gastroparesis . Tell the nurse to bring me a large bucket and some more Dilaudid . "
