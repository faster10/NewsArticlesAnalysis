" Since the anti terror war began , most of my students can now point to Afghanistan and Iraq on a map , which is fine , but those same kids still don ' t know the capitals of Nevada and Ohio , " said Richard Gerber , who teaches at Dunwoody High School in Atlanta . " I think we need to cut back on our activities overseas and take care of business at home , and if that means invading Tallahassee ( Fla . ) or Trenton ( N . J . ) so that students learn where they are , so be it . "
