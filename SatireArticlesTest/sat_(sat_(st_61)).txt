The Egyptian Supreme Council for Antiquities had already officially recognized more than 140 unsuccessful searches for the site of Alexander ' s third and final resting place , built by Ptolemy Philadelphus around 280 BC . Many astounding theories had been elaborated by various historians to explain the fact that the archeological excavations had come up empty handed .

Mark the Evangelist in Basilica di San Marco ( Venice , Italy ) .
