With lines such as " My soul is too black , too black to stay around Soon I will take it away forever , and I ' ll be in the ground " and " Cold as ice , cold as death My soul will soon have no temperature at all , because it ' ll meet Death " , some might argue that Wilkens is justified in wondering about the lack of concern . He did suggest that perhaps not as many people read his LiveJournal as he thought , but conceded that this was probably unlikely , as he gave the link out as often as possible .
