" The President really surprised me . " Said challenger John Kerry . " I thought that The President was too beholden to corporate interests to really speak about how corporations are running amok . It ' s glad to see that I have convinced him that the administration has been wrong on so many issues . He really seems to have a good sense for what needs to be done to change the administration . I hope to do the changing myself , but he gets in there I bet he ' ll really shake the place up and do some good for America . Whomever wins is going to have a big job cleaning up after the guys who are in there now . "
