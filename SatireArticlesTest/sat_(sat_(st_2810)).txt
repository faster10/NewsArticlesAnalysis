Casting off your yoga pants ( in the privacy of your bedroom , of course ! ) does not mean that you need to sacrifice exercise entirely . There are plenty of practical clothing options that may offer even greater ease of movement than the sinful spandex options . For centuries , women tended to home and garden while wearing knee length woven kirtle . However , not every woman cares for the idea of wearing a skirt to the gym . In more recent history , the culotte became the trousers of choice for working women everywhere . The culotte provides a generous amount of legroom while revealing none of your rear aspect . Next time you hit the gym , ditch the unnecessary sex appeal and aim for comfort !
