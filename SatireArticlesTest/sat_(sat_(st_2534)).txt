Obama will also tell Americans that since he is semi black he also only gets stared at by roughly 85 of business owners when he walks in , rather than " just about all of them . " According to Obama , his semi black status also means he gets asked if he plays basketball " a little less " than if he were a real black person . " Also , it should be stated that my semi black status means I ' m allowed to show very small amounts of negative emotion , unlike real black people who are immediately given sideways glances and labeled as ' the angry black man , ' " Obama will say .
