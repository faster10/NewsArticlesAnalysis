Of course , hybrids are all the rage and they are environmentally friendly and blah , blah , blah . I did a little research on the Fusion . The car gets 22 MPG on the freeway and 31 MPG in the city . My car gets 30 MPG on the freeway but only 22 MPG in the city ( and that ' s assuming the traffic is not too heavy ) . That means that it would be more environmentally correct to ban those things from the commuter lanes entirely !
