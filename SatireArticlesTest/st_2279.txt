Tommy " Iron Lung Marin , owner of Church of the Mellow Dragon dispensary in Littleton , Colorado , says he ' s aggravated that anyone , let alone an illegal alien , can simply show up and be given a license that he himself had to work so hard to obtain . " I can understand letting them apply for a permit like everyone else , but to just hand them out is ridiculous , " Marin said . " They should have to play by the same rules as the rest of us . It ' s not like we ' re dealing with vegetables here . "
