SMITHVILLE , OHIO When Richard Kahn turned on his television on October 1st , 2015 and he saw the news of the mass shooting at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg , Oregon , his heart sank . " I thought to myself , " Kahn told our reporter , " oh my God , how can this keep happening ? Can ' t we do something anything to try to at least make these terrible shootings happen less frequently ? " Kahn said that for five days , all he thought about was what he could to help stop gun violence . He considered calling his congressional representatives , and he even thought about ending his NRA membership after 15 years . Now , however , he ' s ready to forget about mass shootings entirely at least until the next one happens in approximately 24 hours from now .
