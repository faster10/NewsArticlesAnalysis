Ms . Fiorina said that just hours after landing her private jet at an airstrip just outside Islamabad , she was in the foothills of mountains near the area when she heard something rustling in the trees . Fiorina said she immediately reached for her AR 15 semi automatic rifle and fired three shots into the woods where she heard the noise . After a moment of listening , Fiorina said she " heard that rustling noise again " and she decided to head into the woods to check it out .
