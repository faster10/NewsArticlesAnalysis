" We ' ve been through the thrift store phase , the dress like grandpa phase , the intentionally scruffy phase . . . there ' s almost nowhere to go , " said Paula Dumond of Portland , OR . " It may be too early to bring back the Chicago cop bushy moustache , for example , so until that look is safely in the past and totally forgotten , we will need something else to buoy the entire community , and there ' s nothing hip on the scene now , not even single gear bicycles , which anyone who ' s anyone knows is totally lame . Again . "
