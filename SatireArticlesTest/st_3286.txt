Howdy folks ! Well , between days at the beach , free movie nights at the park and bike rides around the neighbourhood , this summer sure has been a wild one . Some might even call it the best one yet for the Klipton clan . I made my return to the workforce as Eric ' s personal chauffeur ( the places this kid needs to go ! ) , while Mark , who recently received a promotion at work , seems to have finally got over the infamous river rafting incident ( it was the tube that made that farting noise , wasn ' t it , Mark ? ) . I can ' t believe it ' s September already !
