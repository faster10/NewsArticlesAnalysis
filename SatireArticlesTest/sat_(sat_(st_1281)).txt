I ' m currently hospitalized for blood in my stool . I was found to have a diverticular bleed , but haven ' t required any blood transfusions . Yesterday , I developed swelling in my right leg and an ultrasound revealed a new DVT . I feel like I ' m stuck between a rock and a hard place . If I start a blood thinner , I might bleed . But if I don ' t , I could develop a blood clot in my lungs ! Please help !
