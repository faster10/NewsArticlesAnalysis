" He was a peaceful and charming man before his transplant , " claims Michelle Gonzales , " but after he got his new heart , he became quick tempered , and he seemed obsessed with weapons and hunting . He bought some guns and knives , and began killing everything from rabbits to bears . I didn ' t recognize the man I had married and I decided to leave . I knew he had become more aggressive , but I never thought that he had become such a monster . This is all due to the heart they gave him , it ' s evil ! "
