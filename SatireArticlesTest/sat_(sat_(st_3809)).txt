I ' ve been wondering lately what would happen America falls into another really big economic Depression like the one in the 1930 ' s GDII , if you will . All the market pundits and economic newspapers these days from the Wall Street Journal to ( oh , I don ' t know , I can ' t remember a name right now , so pick one of your own ) are saying it ' s coming . But I ' m not a Wall Street guy and anyway , this isn ' t a Wall Street piece . It ' s about wondering what comes after Wall Street falls apart , like it did in 1929 , if it does at all . It ' s about what America and the world will be like once the money men have gone broke and taken the rest of us down with them . It ' ll be terrible , but it may not be all bad .
