Forget palpation . Punch tender locations as much as possible . With each punch , keep asking , " Painful ? How about now ? How about now ? Be sure to vary the punches : hook , jab , cross , uppercut are just a few options . This will give you an idea of the patient ' s abdominal strength and pain tolerance . Prepare to punch lightly first , then to punch deeply . Look for rebound , guarding , and disbelief . The patient will likely be sore after this part of the exam . If he or she requests pain medication , be sure to do the appropriate thing : discharge home .
