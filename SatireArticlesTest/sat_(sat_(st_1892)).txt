More aged roots of hooping can be traced back to the pioneer days in the 19th century . Girls , having completed their daily chores and homework assignments , would use barrel rings as hoops . The metal bands would cause cuts and scrapes on their bodies and lead to scars and in some cases , permanent damage to their reproductive capabilities . Christian churches eventually placed bans on hooping , yet the desires were still present with youngsters . In the eyes of clergy and protective parenting , the gyration movements of the pelvic area required to propel the hoops were something to be suppressed as preteen boys would gaze upon them in adolescent wonder . Those that ignored the bans were normally shunned and became social outcasts .
