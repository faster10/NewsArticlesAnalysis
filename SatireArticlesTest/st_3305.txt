My sins are many , O great and wondrous Sonicare . Last night , I took to the bottle , sinning four times with whiskey , eight times with beer , three times with cigarettes , and once with something dark and bad tasting that I found on a table . I sinned with a stick of Juicy Fruit , and sinned again in an exchange of mouth fluids with a frumpy looking girl named Sheila , and sinned a final time when I licked a pole as part of a dare .
