Oh my God this is like a liberal manifesto ! Matthew Broderick , reprising his Ferris Bueller role , calls in sick to work . ( Like the Obama economy . ) Then Broderick ( Obramarick ? Ferrack ? ) , instead of doing the responsible thing , plays hooky . You ' re not certain it ' s supposed to be Obama until you see Broderick driving his CRV with a giant panda bear in the passenger seat . That ' s right , in Obama ' s America , China rides shotgun ! But wait . He then joins in a Chinatown celebration where he sings for them . The message : " I no care about future , I just want make Chinese happy happy . " In the end he doesn ' t say CRV stands for " Chinese R Victorious , " but that ' s what he means .
