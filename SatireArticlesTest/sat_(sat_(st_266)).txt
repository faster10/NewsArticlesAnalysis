" We regret any confusion that may have occurred in the purification of Malloy from his impiousness and immorality , " the statement reads . " It is the official position of the Church and of the deity on which it rests that absolving of sins cannot be reneged for a few ' quickies ' . Mr Malloy ' s request to return to sinful nature will require a full out fall from grace , in which case his immortal soul will be handed over to the Dark One , and that ' s worse than church . "
