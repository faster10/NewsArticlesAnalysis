Rice was asked to comment upon how the controversial article and photo spread might reflect upon her position in the Bush Administration . She stated , " I pride myself as always being on top of things at the same time , you try to plan carefully , but leaks happen . I really don ' t see how this will affect my abilities to continue to serve the President . I think that , as Americans , we should all just trust President Bush . If he says we ' re protected , then we ' re protected . "
