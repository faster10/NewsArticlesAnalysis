Yet the Republican Party says I shouldn ' t be able to get health insurance , even though I am in no way a burden on the system quite the opposite , especially in this Recession , I ' m one of the contributors to it . I ' ve never taken unemployment , Welfare or Food Stamps , but I shouldn ' t have an affordable health plan . And it ' s not just because I ' m a Democrat that I could understand but most independent construction workers such as myself are actually Republicans and the GOP doesn ' t want them to have it either .
