But it should be really obvious why I ' m crying right now , " he said . Then after another three full minutes of unhinged crying , and wailing , he said , " I ' m crying because of all the guns that won ' t sold after people fail Obama ' s background checks , and if guns aren ' t sold , profits aren ' t realized , and if profits aren ' t realized , sure , maybe our streets would have a few million fewer guns on them , but are we really safer , " LaPierre asked rhetorically .
