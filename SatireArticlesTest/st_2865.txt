The GOP today announced Cruz would no longer have access to the Republican voter database , essentially kicking him out of the party . GOP strategist Tom Whiteford said , " Without the database , it ' s nearly impossible to raise money . And if Cruz was hoping to run for president again in 2020 against either Trump or Clinton , it will no longer be possible . Trump really twisted our arms over it . This is not something that happens very often , but this isn ' t a typical election . "
