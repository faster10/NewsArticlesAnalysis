Horner says the Republican Party is strongly behind the bill , too . " I ' ve already had a dozen Republicans , key people , agree to sponsor this bill . I ' ve had assurances from party leadership that we can get this legislation muscled through committee and voted on pretty fast . Almost everyone on the Hill has seen it already . Republicans I mean , they ' ve seen it . And if we win big on Tuesday , that ' s all we need to get the ball rolling . "
