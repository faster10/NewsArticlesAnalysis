" In this most recent update , we can predict exposure to infectious diseases by integrating the patient ' s symptom profiles with the health records of their social media contacts , " says Dr Nick Zeez , Chief Medical Officer of InstaDoc . " And the hope is , we will soon be able to predict exposure to sick non acquaintances as well . By using the GPS tracking systems in patients ' smartphones , we should be able to flawlessly identify which pathogens were circulating in an individual ' s airspace , taking into consideration relevant incubation periods and any baseline immunity that an individual has demonstrated previously .
