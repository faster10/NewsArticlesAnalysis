" We must oppose embryo cloning because eventually it will lead to a world of full grown human clones , a vastly different place where the inhabitants behave like sheep , " said Francis Curmud , chairman of the bioethics department at the University of California . For instance , Curmud explained , a company might open a fast food restaurant in California , then open thousands of other restaurants exactly like it around the world , " and even if the food were horrible , the clone people would go there without giving it much thought .
