Having already secured a Purple Heart when he gallantly pushed forward and procured a snack after stubbing his toe on the fridge , Ryan " performed an even greater act of heroism " according to General Admiral Vice Captain Michael Schemwitz , one of the many leaders of the Oregon militia group that seized control of a bird observatory in Burns , Oregon , at the end of 2015 . At a press conference early Monday morning , Schemwitz released video and pictures from an awards ceremony at which Ryan received the Oregon Militia ' s Silver Cross of Valor for what Schemwitz described as " the most amazing feat of military strength " he ' d witnessed in the standoff to date .
