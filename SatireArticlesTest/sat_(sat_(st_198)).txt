" Some segments of the signal are recurrent , and we believe they could be words or letters " says Professor Werthimer . " We don ' t know yet , what the message means , but we are almost certain that it was sent by some form of extraterrestrial intelligence . One segment , which spells " H1C6N7O8P15 , even seems to refer to the atomic numbers of hydrogen ( H ) , carbon ( C ) , nitrogen ( N ) , oxygen ( O ) , and phosphorus ( P ) , the components of DNA . I believe it ' s not only a message from an extraterrestrial life form but it was sent specifically for us ! "
