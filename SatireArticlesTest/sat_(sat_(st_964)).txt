For centuries , medical providers have been waking up hours before sunrise . They have embraced long and strenuous workdays in their familiar and cozy settings of whitewashed artificial lighting only to wrap up their shifts and head home way past sunset . Most , if not all , medical providers have not seen the sparkling sun since the years predating their medical training . On days off when they could potentially reconnect with the shining sun and life in general , medical providers pick the attractive alternate option : stay at home , pajamas on , curtains drawn , and catch up on sleep . As far as they know , the world and everything within it exists in total darkness .
