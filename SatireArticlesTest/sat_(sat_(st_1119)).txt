You ' ve done nothing scramble and make it look like you did a ton of stuff before the next shift comes on . Hallelujah ! Sprint out the door . Use leftover curse words on miserably long commute home . Pretend to be productive at home fail with flying colors . Retreat into introverted shell . If narcolepsy sets in , fall asleep in work clothes . If not , artificially induce sleep : drop two Benadryls into a glass of red wine . Oh wait ! Remember something that you forgot to do . Worry you might lose sleep over it . Minutes later : pass out like a freaking champ .
