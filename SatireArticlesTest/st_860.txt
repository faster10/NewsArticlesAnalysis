" We had to get creative , " said Dr Ferry Charon , director of palliative care at RVU . " The primary care team just orders the consult but never tells the patient that we will be visiting . There we are , supposed to talk about hospice to someone who is totally dumbstruck and unprepared for our visit . We were spending an inordinate amount of time at each initial consult explaining to the patient why we were there . Surely , there had to be a gentle way to get patients prepped for our visit . "
