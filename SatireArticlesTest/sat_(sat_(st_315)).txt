" People like seeing irritating people comment on things they just experienced , but we ' re betting that they ' ll love seeing those same people comment on things that they will someday experience , unless they die , " Norman said . " And believe me : VH1 doesn ' t want people to die , unless it is in a spectacular manner that can be discussed while we play a clip of P . O . D . ' s ' Alive ' in the background . "
