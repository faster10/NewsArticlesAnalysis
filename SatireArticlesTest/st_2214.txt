" The bottom line is a really simple one , " Levi said , " the Second Amendment is the most important amendment in the Constitution , even though it wasn ' t important enough for them to make it the very first amendment . " Mr Levi emphasized that , " Any threat to the Second Amendment is a threat to our liberty " and that " if we can ' t sleep at night , relatively assured that we can go to our caches and weapons lockers , grab our guns , and go kill government officials we didn ' t vote for and the people who did vote for them , then we don ' t live in America anymore , period . "
