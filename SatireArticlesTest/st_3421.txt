The meeting with Limbaugh and O ' Reilly was said to be very relaxed and " convivial " in contrast to the gravity of the subject matter according to White House sources . O ' Reilly took the opportunity to present Limbaugh with an Andrea Mackris autographed cigar , which he promptly lit and smoked throughout the meeting . " I think this is the first cigar that ' s been in the White House since the Clintons left , " quipped the president , " or at least since Bandar came by after 9 11 . "
