" And even if he doesn ' t , I only get , like , six more years , and then I have to leave no matter how many more people vote for me ! I know it ' s not fair , and I know it ' s backwards , but boys , that ' s just how it is . That ' s why I need to make a plan for putting bread on the table after I ' m let go . "
