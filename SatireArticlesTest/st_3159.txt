Cyllata feels like she ' s in a stream , not of water , but of life itself . Where once she was alone , now there are thousands , just like her , all around her , streaming upward , skittering over the rivulets of bark . Her unseeing , subterranean eyes do not belie the excitement she feels , nor do they behold the nymph she was . She only knows that now is the time to become an adult . Now , as she clings to this branch , to this moment , she knows the time has come to shed her skin to break out of her shell to emerge bold and beautiful , a swan of her species . Her body quivers as her shell splits open , as Cyllata , the new Cyllata , the real Cyllata , emerges . And then is eaten by a bird .
