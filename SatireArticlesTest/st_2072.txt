Eric immediately got up and attempted to hose the residual bath salts off his burning skin with a detachable shower head but this only seemed to make things worse . " It felt like someone was rubbing millions of microscopic shards of broken glass into every pore . I knew I was in trouble . I got out of the bathtub and looked in the mirror and my entire body was red and blistering in some spots . The burning was so intense that I began to feel nauseous and faint . I lost consciousness after dialing 911 . I woke up in the hospital a few days later . "
