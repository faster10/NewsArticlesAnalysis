The choices here are so stark that I find it incredible that there ' s an undecided voter left . Pick any criteria youth vs . age , unilateralism vs . consensus , rich vs . the rest of us . I say the last because these days only the far upper end of the middle class has more in common with the rich than they do the poor . Face it , when you own a four or five hundred thousand dollar home you can ' t pay the mortgage on , are constantly worried about losing your job and have watched your retirement savings disappear , you ' ve got more in common with the worries of the poor than the rich .
