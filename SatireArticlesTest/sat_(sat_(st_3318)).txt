So there we are , wandering around this place with big 37 foot wide screen Televisions and 102 speaker stereo systems blinking and blaring all around us , trying to find the CD aisle . ( The CD aisle . Think about that there ' s a whole aisle devoted to selling just blank CDs . This is the overload I ' m talking about . ) We stumble onto the Computer games aisle . Along the row there are TVs set up with stations attached so you can sample the games . At one station is this little fat kid wearing the standard de rigueur outfit of baggy jeans hanging half way down his butt and over sized tee shirt which of course makes him look even more disgustingly meatball like than he actually is ( an important aside here : my wife thinks I can be cruel and heartless when it comes to my description of people I see . She likes to point out , and rightly so , I afraid , that I ' m an ugly little dweeb that people laugh at when they look at me . Well , let them write their own stupid essays and excoriate me in them . This is my time . )
