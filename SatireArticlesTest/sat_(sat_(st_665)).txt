Jensen regrets not having joined his colleagues on the many sojourns to the back of the school where they hide behind the dumpster in sub zero temperatures and distribute " squares " ( slang for cigarettes ) , find a lighter or pack of matches taken from Bob Evans , and smoke defiantly , only to hide their breath from suspicious teachers and administrators upon re entering the building . Keggers and Denny ' s runs after midnight , admits Jensen , would all have been much better if he ' d established a disciplined smoking routine .
