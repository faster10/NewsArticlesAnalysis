Steven Jordan , former director of a federal agency , stressed his support for the soldiers now facing charges of " sadistic , blatant and wanton abuses " saying that the only way to get the war over quickly was to " treat the detainees like shit until they will sell their mother for a blanket , some food without bugs in it and some sleep . " Janice Karpinski , a business consultant from Colorado , suggested that " the Pentagon should hire professional torturers , give them a free hand , and help the Iraqi people make up their minds which side they want to be on , " while Donald J . Reese , a reservist and salesman , said that , for many of the Iraqi inmates at Abu Ghraib , " living conditions are better in prison than at home . They probably don ' t want to leave . "
