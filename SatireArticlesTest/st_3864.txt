Other Middle East watchers are not as optimistic as Juan Cole . " This is the straw that broke the camels back . " Said news personality Andrew Sullivan . " I mean , it ' s not like the Arab street ever really trusted us . Juan Cole has got it all wrong . I think that the fantastic relations between Bush and the Arab world was a fragile shell not a ' deep reservoir of trust ' . Sure it looked great from the outside , lots of trust and dialogue , but on inside the bond was brittle . All it took was one swift blow and the whole thing collapsed . And its ' all Newsweek ' s fault . I think the war in Iraq could go badly now and I lay the blame at Newsweek ' s feet . "
