" April will be a month primarily focused on green initiatives . We ' ll be working toward making the Federal Government run leaner and reducing our carbon footprint by using less paper , installing more solar panels on Federal buildings , and pushing for the military to rely more on solar energy for its structures as well . And we ' re hoping Congress will work toward green initiatives as well , with the President vowing to support any truly green bill proposed by either party . "
