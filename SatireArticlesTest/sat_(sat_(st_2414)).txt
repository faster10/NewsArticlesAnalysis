Beginning with the first half way decent album that the Young Brothers ( Malcolm and Angus ) created , T . N . T . , it was clear that the foundation was in place . Cross dressing lead singer Bon Scott screams " I got the devil in my blood , telling what to dooooo and I ' m all ears , " in the song , " It ' s a Long Way to the Top ( If You Want to Rock and Roll . ) " The album ' s title track ( also named , " T . N . T . " ) is designed to harden a pre teen boy ' s little pube pickle in a pathetic machismo fantasy of misplaced bravado . Teachers in the day complained of the tykes chasing after each other with their hands out on the recess playground yelling , " oy , oy , oy ! "
