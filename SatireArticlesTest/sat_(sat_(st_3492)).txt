Radical Christian Conservative Imam , the Reverend Jerry Falwell , has back peddled on a statement he made earlier that everyone in America , Jews , Muslims , Shintoists and worse , Democrats should " Vote Christian in 2008 " . Saying that he meant no harm ( which proves that he has a finely honed sense of the absurd ) Imam Falwell said , " What I was saying was for Conservative Christian voters to vote their values , which are Pro Life and pro family . I had no intention of being anti beanie baby or mud people at all . Not that it matters after the Rapture , all those Christ Killers are toast anyway . "
