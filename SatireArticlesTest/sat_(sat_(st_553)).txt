" We regret the massive injuries inflicted on the innocent victim of this attack , " said Career Builder spokesperson Mark Antograst . " However , this one isolated incident is not typical of the behavior of our quadrumanous actors , who , to no harm to anyone but themselves , are sometimes seen sharing a joint or Valium to calm their nerves before the next scene . To crack down on their access to stimulants might jeopardize an entire industry that is based on putting monkeys in commercials , and they can sell anything ! "
