Back in the Twentieth Century , that quaint time of Walter Cronkite , Edward R . Murrow and Chet Huntley you know , when you could actually trust what a newscaster was telling you to be accurate and unbiased , CNN did it ' s job beautifully . When the Challenger exploded , we all turned on CNN and watched it twenty four hours a day . When the stock market crashed in 1987 , Bush Sr . attacked Iraq in the First Gulf War or Bill Clinton got hauled up before Congress , it was CNN we watched , crowding in front of our TV ' s , looking for all the world like those old photos you see of families gathered around their radios listening to FDR announce Japan attacked Pearl Harbor . CNN were the go to guys for news they didn ' t tell you what it meant , they just told you what it was .
