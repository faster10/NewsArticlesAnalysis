The song allegedly rewritten by the ex Beatle is the melody of Yesterday but with updated lyrics . It describes how Mills McCartney ' s leg came unattached and how McCartney literally fell for her by tripping over the errant limb to form a union that was destined to last forever , if forever is more than two years but less then ten . The demo , for some reason recorded at Rich Sound in Queens , New York , made its way to Robert Novak , who posted it on iTunes .
