Mom , I know that you ' re really mad at me because I made the family look bad . I know you wanted Jeb to be President too and you think I messed that up . You always liked Jeb better than me , I know that . But just because I never learned talk good is no reason blame me for Jeb . After all , I was a Governor and President who needs to learn how to talk right when you ' re already the leader of the world ? And Karl told me people liked it when I sounded stupid , or folksy , as he called . So it was his fault , I admit it .
