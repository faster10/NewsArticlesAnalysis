Former Vice President and famed conservationist Al Gore was outraged by the story . " I ' m really upset here . Really , really upset . I thought Barack was better than this . He ' s going to fly down to the Everglades with two gigantic airliners , ride in a motorcade twenty cars long through the Florida Everglades , and they ' ll keep all those cars running while he gives a speech about climate change . Mother Earth deserves better , Mr President . She deserves much , much better . "
