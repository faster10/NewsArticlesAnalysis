The Tea People don ' t believe that . Very near half of them , when polled , identify themselves as Fundamentalist Christians . For them , this isn ' t about taxes or healthcare or politics , it ' s about religion . It ' s about making America into what the call a " Judeo Christian " country again , which is pretty laughable . For one thing , if these guys take over , I wouldn ' t wanna be one of the Jews in " Judeo Christian " the Tea People may go after the dreaded Muslims first , but the Jews would be next . Well , maybe Muslims , then next the Hindus cause all these Indian people are pissing us off whenever we call for tech support , then the Jews . But the point is , sooner or later , everybody who doesn ' t accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior has got to go .
