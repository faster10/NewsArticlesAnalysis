In the case of Dr Talbot ' s patient , circumstances delayed the autopsy , likely compounding the problem . " The delays were unavoidable , " said Dr Nichols . " The patient died on a Wednesday afternoon , and it took most of Thursday to sort out the paperwork . I was on vacation on Friday , and I don ' t work on the weekends . Monday was a holiday , of course , and on Tuesday , I just plain forgot about it . That was my bad . But we started the autopsy first thing Wednesday morning at 1030 . Unfortunately , by then a week had gone by , and there wasn ' t much we could do . "
