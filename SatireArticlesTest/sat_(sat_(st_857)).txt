Jim Gandy ( 47 ) , the aforementioned patient and recent right lower extremity amputee suffering an infection in his remaining foot , sees value in the arrangement as well . " Mark is quick to the draw when I hit the call light for my scheduled pain meds . I ' m not sure if he ' s just so busy or doesn ' t care , but he never mentions when he sees me with candy and other contraband food . He also seems to gets a kick out of cleaning me and the bed up when I ' ve had an accident . I could probably use the bedside commode but with stretchers this comfortable , who wants to get up just to dump out ?
