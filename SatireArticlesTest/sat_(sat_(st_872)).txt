In order to get the Dilaudid , you need to bypass the weaker stuff like Percocet and morphine . The best way around this ? Develop a fullproof allergy list . Say you can ' t take Tylenol because it gives you hives , or ibuprofen because it gives you herpes . Tell them you itch when you take Vicodin or morphine and therefore it is a TRUE DRUG allergy , unless you ' re given unlimited IV Benadryl . I can ' t stress enough to only request Dilaudid by its first letter . REPEATEDLY .
