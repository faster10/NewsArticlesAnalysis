Officials in Texas immediately attacked the study when their governor charged that the study has " a liberal bias . " Pollin denies the indicators are biased . " The Texas ranking is low because the conditions for workers are bad in Texas , " Pollin said . New Mexico ' s officials also thought they were given a poor rating because a large portion of their economy comes from mining , but Pollin said accident rates were excluded from the study because mining has a larger proportion of accidents than other industries and would bias the study . Rather than defending their states , Pollin would like to see states consider a different perspective on economic well being and consider the implications of the results .
