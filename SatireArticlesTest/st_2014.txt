The bill , titled " The Kentucky Voluntary Servitude Act of 2015 , " would allow Kentuckians to essentially sell themselves into slavery , with the funds they generate from the sale being transferred to family , friends , or whomever they ' d like the money to go to . Once they ' ve sold themselves , the State would recognize them as the physical property of the purchaser , who can command their new slave to carry out any legal task , from cooking and cleaning to manual labor .
