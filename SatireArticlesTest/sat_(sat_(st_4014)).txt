At this point Ms . Palin ' s handlers , finally realizing that the wildly applauding audience either wasn ' t actually listening to her or didn ' t know the difference between allies and alleys either , ceased trying to stop her and continued to triage their wounded comrade ' s eye . Ms . Palin finished her thought ? by saying , " Look , America , I don ' t know exactly why Barack wants to sell all our little back streets to Russia and China those Liberals in the White House aren ' t telling us everything , let me tell ya . But what ' s gonna happen to the deli shop owner if their delivery trucks can ' t get through the ally to get their rye bread delivered ? Why , business will stop they won ' t be able to sell their ham and cheese sandwiches to the Jewish priests who they call Rabies , by the way that ' s what . It ' s the little guy , the small business owners , that ' ll suffer . I don ' t know about you , but I won ' t stand for anymore government intervention in the rights of small Isreally business owners ! "
