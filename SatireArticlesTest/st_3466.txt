Being an egotistical and self congratulatory jerk , I like to think that in some way I was helpful in spreading the news about Ms . Sheehan . Whether or not that ' s true ( and sadly , it probably isn ' t ) , I can ' t help feeling a little blue when I read all these stories about her it ' s kinda like watching your kid go off to her first day of school . She belongs to the world now . From a simple news blurb she ' s progressed to first being an item worthy of a paragraph , to a full story to a major event and finally , a complete symbol of the entire anti war anti Bush movement all in ten days . She must be ready to crack under the pressure I know I would be and I know that ' s what George Bush is hoping for .
