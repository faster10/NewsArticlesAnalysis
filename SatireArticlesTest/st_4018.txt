So I ' m reading the net this morning , trying to figure out whether the Tea Party primary wins are as good ( or bad ) for the November elections as they appear ( or don ' t seem ) to be . I ' m on Bloomberg , reading about New York Rick Lazio got beaten by Carl Paladino , a Conservative who blew like , three million of his own money to buy into the election ( you ever notice how many Conservative rich guys do that ? Spend millions to get a job that pays less than 200K a year ? Why ? ) . But then , as an off hand comment , it says , that like Andrew Cuomo , the Democratic candidate , he promises to curb , " New York ' s spending habits that have resulted in the second highest combined state and local tax burden in the U . S . , trailing only Alaska . " Alaska ? Isn ' t that where Sarah Palin , the Princess of the Tea Party , was governor for almost a full half term ? They have the highest tax burden in the United States ? Can that be right ?
