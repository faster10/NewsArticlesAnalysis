You know , I haven ' t changed your page since you left . It ' s just like it was when we were still under one site , one happy family . Ouch , memories ! But it ' s still there , if you want to come back and see it , even maybe make a few changes . Nice to have it lived in once in a while . Not that I ' m asking you to move back in . I know you have your own URL now and your own " site " , which I shouldn ' t say , so I won ' t , that it ' s a mess Mr Garbage Mouth and my friend Mrs Meierson , who must have seen it G d knows how , says don ' t make yourself sick , that son of yours is just a nebbish , a nobody , look at the way he keeps that site of his with all the broken links and script errors .
