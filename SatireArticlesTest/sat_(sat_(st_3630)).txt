Bush : Maybe but not so much anymore . I think what I liked the most was the author ' s stress on the importance of morals and Christian beliefs . This guy Marlboro was kind of a tragi comic figure like Karl said , I seem to remember that term from English class . You really admire him for standing behind his beliefs and not wagering in adversity . But , in the end it ' s pretty sad when you come to realize that this keeps him from accepting Jesus as his savior .
