" On Halloween , " one frightened youth remembers , " we got up our courage and went to the old Brukenheimer place . Tommy , the bravest , ate sugar daddies until he felt he could approach the door and knock . It opened , slowly revealing a form barely discernable for the light coming from behind . The dark figure raised its hand , and visage leering , dropped a toothbrush and an apple into Tommy ' s bag ! We dress up as some pretty scary stuff , but I ' m not even interested in hearing what twisted , evil force could take hold of a man and cause him to act like that . "
