( Aurora CO ) A high school teacher has been suspended because of the remarks he made after President Bush ' s State of the Union address , which were recorded by a student . The teacher was alleged to have compared Bush to Hitler . Of course , the fact that the student secretly recorded the teacher ' s remarks to play for her parents that evening in no way should be interpreted as an administration whose philosophy has imprinted on the nation ' s youth that being a member of George Orwell ' s Thought Police is okay as long as you ' re secretly recording things on a cool cell phone or PDA .
