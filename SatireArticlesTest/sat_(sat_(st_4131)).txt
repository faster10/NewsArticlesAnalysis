Look at this way , money spent on guns and bombs is good for world Christianity and the American economy . Munitions factory jobs are good paying manufacturing jobs that will be held by Christians . And those munitions factories need steel , so that creates good foundry jobs , whish will be held by Christians . Those munitions factories and foundries will have offices and computers , so we are going to need lots of high paid Christian white collar workers too . These jobs will boost the economy and fatten up the collection plate .
