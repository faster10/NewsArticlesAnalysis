Mr Jasper also had a ready list of items that he feels negates a woman ' s right to abort her rape pregnancy . " Things like making eye contact , smiling , politely declining a drink , " Jasper said , " these are all ways a gal can make herself seem okay with having sex with someone , and should be natural carve outs for rape laws . " In his estimation , the retired salesman says , " if the victim can prove she was basically sitting there , in a burqa or other type of completely concealing clothing , not speaking , not looking at anyone , barely breathing really , then she should get to have an abortion . Otherwise , I ' m sorry , but society must step in and remove her right to reproduce whenever she feels ready , and not after being violated sexually . "
