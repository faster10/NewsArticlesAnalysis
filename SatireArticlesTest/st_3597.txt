What actually rankles the TP is that the Movement , of which nearly 80 used to or either still identify themselves as Republican , is actually responsible in large part for the current Great Recession , due to their voting for George W . Bush ' s Great 2001 Tax Giveaway ( " If you vote for me , I ' ll give you all 350 . 00 " ) and his borrowing from Communist China to fund his tax cuts and the War In Iraq . So they voted themselves into this mess in the first place by ignoring the fact that while Republicans may be great at actually making money for themselves , they really suck at managing an economy .
