Bush , who left Tuesday for an extended vacation at his Texas ranch , answered questions from Texas reporters , who pledged not to ask anything difficult . Deflecting , bantering and BS ing his way through questions , the president said he doesn ' t care that most Americans don ' t share his views and he plans to declare victory and bring the troops home before the next election . When asked about his promise to fire anyone in the White House who revealed the name of a CIA operative , the president responded with a chuckle , " How can I fire myself ? "
