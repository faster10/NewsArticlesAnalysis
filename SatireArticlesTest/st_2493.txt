Aides on Capitol Hill claim the Republicans are hoping to come up with a response to the deal by Friday of this week . One aide says that " they ' ll probably take the deal . We ' ve been trying for years to find something , anything , to sully Obama ' s reputation , but nothing ever works . Every time we call him on the economy , he adds a few hundred thousand more jobs . Every time we try to repeal Obamacare , it gets shot down and blows up in our faces . If this doesn ' t work , nothing is going to get this black guy out of the White House . "
