Others speculated that running around accusing people of the things you were supposedly guilty of yourself what a poor methodology in order to remedy racist tendencies . Jill Holland who is the coordinator of " Rainbow Voices , a bi monthly publication covering race issues in Denver had this to add . " Racism isn ' t this hot potato that you toss in others laps which magically cures you of your calamity .

In this day and age however , it ' s not surprising that others might be encouraged by professionals to pass the buck and blame others in order to emancipate yourself from any given responsibility . It ' s ridiculous , but so is the world we live in , obviously . "
