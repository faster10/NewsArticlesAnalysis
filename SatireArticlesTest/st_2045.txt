The audience was stunned , with half of the attendees gasping audibly . But some people clapped , and others cheered , and soon , the audience was roaring with support . " Folks , I ' m a woman . I ' m a proud woman . I ' m a proud American woman , and a proud conservative woman . Caitlyn Jenner showed all of us transgender folks that all it takes is that first courageous step , that bold effort to reveal your true self to the world , and she shows us how beautiful a transgender person can be . I ' m ready for that change , America . I ' m ready to become a woman . And I want you to join me on my journey . Not just my gender journey , but my journey into the White House , where as your president , I ' ll make sure transgender voices big and small are heard . I am a woman , America ! Hear me roar ! "
