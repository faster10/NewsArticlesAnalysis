" Although I was unconscious and my body lay paralyzed on the floor , I felt like I was outside my body and could hear and see all the commotion my heart failure had caused around me , " he explains .

I knew I was not dead " he remembers , still visibly under shock . " All I remember after that is waking up in the ambulance in excruciating pain , " he explained .
