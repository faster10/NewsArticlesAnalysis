Bush : The book really does inspire you to be able to stick by your guns when you ' re surrounded by a lot of gloom doomers and naysayers .

I think literature is always open to interpretation , just like diplomacy as we are faced with the possibility of impending peace in the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah , it is important for us to not give up all hope .
