" The ancient practice of the Feast of Fools has been put in peril by these impious Christian folk who refuse to worship our god , and who inject their radical ideas into our antediluvian and sacred rituals , " said Moonbeam Saturna , high priest of Pleasant Valley Church of Tammuz . " All of this ' Christmas ' brouhaha is a distraction from the true meaning of the Saturnalia season , and that meaning is sacrificing the leader of the village after drinking his wine and eating his goats , all to appease Ashtoreth , the Goddess of Fertility .
