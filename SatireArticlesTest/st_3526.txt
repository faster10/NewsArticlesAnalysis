A number of Democratic legislative goals would impact working people positively : increasing the minimum wage , decreasing student loan rates , negotiating for lower Medicare drug prices , and promoting alternate energy sources . To prove they are tough on national security , Democrats will tighten security at ports and vulnerable industrial plants , and possibly increase the size of the military . Egregiously destructive Republican environmental policies will be stymied and small positive steps will be taken to decrease our ravenous appetite for oil . A mild ethics law may be passed . Republicans will fight each issue with every political weapon in their arsenal .
