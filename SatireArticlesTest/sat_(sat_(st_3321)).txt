We walked on . Everywhere , everyone was talking on cell phones , maybe to each other for all I know . Now being an American myself , I know one thing : we have nothing important to say , and certainly nothing so important that we ' d have to interrupt a trip to the mall to communicate with someone at home base . ( " Honey ? It ' s me . I ' m in front of Sears , heading towards Filenes . Right now I ' m passing the Burger King and in a minute I be near Radio Shack . I ' ll call back and keep you posted . By the way , my foot itches . " )
