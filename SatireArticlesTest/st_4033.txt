That thought isn ' t really finished , but I felt it ' s time to start a new paragraph anyway . In a flash of what passes for intelligent thought in my world , it suddenly occurred to me why not just move Christ ' s birthday to it ' s rightful place and forget the whole controversy over Christmas completely ? Now , I know a bunch of people will get all bent out of shape , saying that God made Christmas on December 25th and who are we to argue ? The point is this : God didn ' t make Christmas December 25th . In His best selling autobiography , The Bible , God actually never mentioned His only Son ' s birth date . That ' s okay , my own Dad always forgot my birthday too and Bing Crosby smacked his kid . Fathers can be like that . Anyway , the only mention of the big J ' s b day is astronomical in nature the Star . So we ' re left with April 7th or the 17th or whatever the models , remember ?
