Andrew O ' Hara , owner of ' The Gaming Den ' in Larchmont , NY is alleging that Diesel is " too good " and " enjoys beating up on less experienced players " . O ' Hara claims that Diesel has attended several of the gaming events his shop has promoted and that the celeb is less than forgiving when grouped with novice gamers . " He has a Fighter character that has ' Chaotic Evil ' alignment and Mr Diesel has no remorse in wantonly killing anything he encounters with that character . He ' s even been known to turn on the members of his own group for no reason and obliterate characters they ' ve spent months leveling up . " A ' Chaotic Evil ' character is one that is excessively cruel , has no respect for the rules of the game and enjoys death and suffering .
