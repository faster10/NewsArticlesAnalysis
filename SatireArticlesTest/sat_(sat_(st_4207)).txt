So now we ' re in an age when the most trusted name in news is not a news organization at all , but Comedy Central with The Daily Show and the Colbert Report . Why ? Because everyone knows that both the Right and the Left are lying to us and Jon Stewart skewers everyone , even though he ' s obviously one of them Liberal Jews . Colbert is a practicing Catholic who doesn ' t trust the Pope , ( which of course makes him a Liberal Jew who just happens to believe in Jesus ) , but both obviously know when they ' re being lied to , so I listen to them . And anyway , when the " news " is a joke , why not at least make it funny ?
