But these are minor things . The important issue is to reinvigorate Catholicism , which can only be done by electing a non Catholic pope a Jewish pope . ( Leo XIV ? It ' s traditional , but Leo sounds Jewish . ) In this way , the differences between Christians and Jews can be minimized , and the " universal love that popes claim to represent can be legitimately expressed . And hopefully , someday , the answer to " Is the Pope Catholic ? won ' t be so obvious .
