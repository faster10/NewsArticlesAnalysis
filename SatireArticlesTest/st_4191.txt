President Bush , when asked about the abortion pill debate said , " I nominated Crawford for the post , so I must agree with him that abortion is okay . And if I remember correctly from my alcohol and drug addled days as a jet pilot , anal and oral sex is pretty neat too . " Conservative Christian groups , whose support of Bush won him re election last November are said to be getting behind the concept of both contraceptives and weird sex , since they believed President Bush was God ' s choice to lead America and therefore this must be what God wants . Many churches are said to be planning Christian Sex Nights for their children .
