Unnamed White House Source Wegman ( Pudgy ) Waterhouse , speaking on the condition of anonymity said , " I personally was a little leery of wearing a button that said " Give Me More Dick , Please " but my wife seems to love hers . The only one who doesn ' t seem too thrilled with the new program is the Vice President ' s daughter Mary , but I ' m not sure why . She does always wear the " I Love Bush " button though . I tell you this right now though , I ' m not letting my daughter wear the " Give Me Dick Please ! " button , ever . "
