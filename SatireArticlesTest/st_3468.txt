There was a time , just two short weeks ago in fact , when the Secret Service could have politely come and gotten Ms . Sheehan and driven her up to the ranch for a nice cup of hot coco with George . He could have told her that he really believed that he was furthering the cause of Freedom and was truly sorry for her loss and also for the fact that she disagreed with him , but being a man of great conviction and personal honor he had to do what he thought was right . He could have pointed out that Casey Sheehan volunteered for the duty that took his life , so at least he must have believed in the Noble Cause , whether or not she did . Karl Rove could have written it all own for him so he wouldn ' t screw it up . And it just might have worked . But he didn ' t and now he ' s paying for it by exposing himself as an uncaring coward who ' s afraid of a middle aged woman . It ' s too late now and boy , I can ' t wait for his next press conference .
