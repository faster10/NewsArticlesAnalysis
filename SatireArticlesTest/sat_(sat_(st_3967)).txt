And before you get all eco on me , let me explain exactly why we even have an RV . My wife attended the College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse , and we bought the RV to set up as a mobile field research lab . An injury put an end to that dream , but to our surprise , we found out that we actually liked the RV and despite what you ' d think , it ' s actually a very inexpensive way to travel , especially if you have dogs . Sure , it uses a lot of gas , but when you compare the numbers hotels , restaurants , airfare , car rentals , etc . , you actually save money . And unless you ' re driving everyday , you don ' t even use much fuel . You go maybe two hundred miles and park it for a week . Ours is 11 years old and it ' s only gone 30 , 000 miles and looks like new .
