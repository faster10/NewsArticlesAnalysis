" One of our largest campaign expenditures is transportation , " said Jindal travel co rdinator Bucky Jindal , " so we set up an online campaign to help fund our transportation options . " Those options reportedly include a ) economy bus tickets for Bobby Jindal and one other essential staff member or b ) a reconditioned little yellow school bus which Bobby Jindal himself will drive . " We like to think of it as our own modern day freedom ride , " said Bucky Jindal , " because our campaign is about substance , and not at all about style . "
