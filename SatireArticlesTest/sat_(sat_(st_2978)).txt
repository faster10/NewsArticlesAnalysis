" Dogs fight , don ' t let anyone tell you different . We even run in packs , occasionally . But one thing we would never do is become dependent upon an economic system that lacks true redundancy . You brag about your global , networked economy and how it is less susceptible to collapse because various aspects overlap or can operate independently . But you don ' t really have a workable backup system like dogs . Our economy is relatively simple , I grant you . It ' s based on the acquisition of food . We try to find food , but if that fails , if we are unsuccessful , we have a viable , available alternative . We eat our own shit . You , in contrast , try to get your loans restructured by the World Bank . "
