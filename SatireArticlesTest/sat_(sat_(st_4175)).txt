Something else happened too during the party a bunch of really greedy cousins who were the black sheep ' s of the family and called themselves ' The Short Sellers ' , had been crashing the parties , but no one had noticed them in their drunken stupors . After all , they looked like family . These Short Sellers had figured out a way to get a lot of booze for themselves by manipulating the price of liquor in their favor . They owned the liquor while the cousins just owned the bottles . This is actually what ' s been causing the rich cousins to finally start asking for their stocks of liquor back from each other , to cover what the Short Sellers were doing , but by this time it ' s too late . Everybody ' s drunk it all and there are only empty bottles lying around .
