Political expert Ellis Paul speculates , " I think ISIS assumed they ' d be able to either ransom funds or possibly even nuclear weaponry from the North Korean military in return for Kim . Considering the disdain much of the North Korean officials are rumored to have for their leader , it is not too surprising any of them viewed this as a golden opportunity for a bloodless coup . Kim Jong un has few friends in the world and even fewer within his own kingdom and it seems ISIS has miscalculated a bit if this ' chatter ' rings true . I seriously doubt either China or Russia would be willing to intervene on Kim ' s behalf . "
