2000 2008 : George W . Bush won the presidency in 2000 by just nine votes ( that would be the Supreme Court to you and me ) , making it the nation ' s closest election . Ever . Nine months later , while he was reading children ' s books to kindergarteners , Saudi Arabian terrorists attacked America . In response , W . attacked ( rightly ) Afghanistan , who was harboring the terrorists , and ( weirdly ) Iraq , who , despite having an evil dictator , had nothing to do with it . At all . The logic was that Iraq had Weapons of Mass Destruction , which we were certain of , as the president ' s father , Bush the Elder , had sold them to the Iraqis back in the 80 ' s and 90 ' s .
