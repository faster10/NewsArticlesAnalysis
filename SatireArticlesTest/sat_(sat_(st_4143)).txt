1 . If you ' re a bit old , you may remember the days when there was something called ' gas wars ' competition between gas stations which posted lower prices than others . Why now is every station in town selling gas at the SAME price ? COLLUSION ! All the companies Shell , Exxon Mobil , Texaco , etc . hold secret meetings and agree upon a pump price . Among stations , this may vary a penny or two to pretend there is competition . Price fixing was illegal under all previous administrations , but Bush , Cheney and their oily friends are getting richer and richer by encouraging this monopolistic practice .
