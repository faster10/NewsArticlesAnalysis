While the Hebrews have always been pretty accurate record keepers and Chanukah is probably right where it ' s supposed to be , I ' m hoping that with a little prompting we can convince them to move The Festival of Lights to January after 2 , 300 years you ' d think they can give the rest of us a week or two in the interest of world wide peace , marketing and sales . Kwanzaa , the First Harvest , can move it ' s start from December 26th to New Years Day nothing should have spoiled by then .
