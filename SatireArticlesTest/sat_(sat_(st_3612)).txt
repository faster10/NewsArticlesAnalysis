Prodigal Son of a Bitch makes the claim that there is no chance that this was an accidental plane crash . " The plane was exceptional , the pilots well qualified , and the weather posed no significant problems . Even the National Transportation Safety Board ' s simulations were unable to bring the plane down .

' It quoted Carol Carmody , the NTSB ' s acting chair and reportedly a former CIA employee , as saying , ' We find the whole turn curious . ' "
