Donald Trump ' s campaign released a statement after Carson ' s announcement of his October campaign haul that congratulated Dr Carson for his success but also admonished him not to get too cocky . " I have lost more money on bad business deals with my name on them than anyone else in this campaign , " Trump ' s statement said , " and I have the bankruptcy court orders to prove it . I ' m self funding my campaign , because I don ' t need a bunch of loser money co mingling with my winner money , but I will say this : I do hope that the morons who support us will switch their allegiance over to either one of us , when the inevitable happens and one of us has to drop out . Which will be you . Because I ' m a winner , and winner ' s never lose or quit or have anything bad happen to them ever . "
