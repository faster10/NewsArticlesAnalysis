I will not be ashamed to say " It ' s a paradigm shift or " It ' s a win win or " I ' m a team player or " Deal with it or " This is where the rubber meets the road or " Let ' s circle back to that or " There ' s some low hanging fruit or " I may sound like a broken record or " My door is always open or " Let ' s address the elephant in the room , " nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed to deflect the honest questions or grumblings of those who work for me .
