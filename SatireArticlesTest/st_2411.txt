Michelle Duggar was believed to be seen recently in a poor quality TMZ videoclip , shot in a Walmart parking lot , refuting a local reporter questioning her about the possibility that the missing child , " Baby J " , could be hers , by responding angrily that she thought it was " insulting to all women , to think any woman could simply walk off and leave behind a baby or a toddler on a vacation trip , because no one could ever be that out of it , ever . " The end of the video shows her and several of the younger members of the Duggar ' s clan driving off in their S . U . V . , with two bags of groceries on the vehicle ' s roof .
