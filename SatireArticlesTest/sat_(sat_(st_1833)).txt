At this point , Zimmerman drops his beverage and reaches into his jacket . The teen holding the cell phone raises it , and then the video abruptly ends . Authorities say a State Police cruiser , which just happened to be driving by at that moment , pulled over , and the officers found Zimmerman aiming a 9mm pistol at the two teens , who had their hands raised above their heads . After drawing their own weapons and ordering Zimmerman to drop his , Zimmerman was taken into custody .
