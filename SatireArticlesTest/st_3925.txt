MW : Hello , Dominus . It ' s great to speak with you . To answer your question , the immigration control movement has been incredibly misled , but to the advantage of central planners in the state apparatus . They see immigrants as the source of economic problems , rather than state interference in the marketplace . This gives us a scapegoat to work with . They also distrust President Bush on the immigration control issue , since he hasn ' t been very interested in curtailing immigration . But at the same time , they beg for an occupied border and even a wall . If they do not trust Bush on this issue , why would they trust Bush with a wall ? Do they really think he would use it for any reason other than trapping Americans in ?
