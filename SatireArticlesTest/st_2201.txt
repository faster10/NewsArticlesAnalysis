Townsend feels Rose will likely not acknowledge the honor North Korea is reportedly bestowing upon him . " Assuming he ( Pete Rose ) is even aware of this of development , I ' d imagine by now he has sought legal counsel and will most likely not react to the news publicly . I can ' t imagine that working out well for him , " Townsend speculates . " Unless Dennis Rodman gets involved , I see there being zero chance that Pete Rose will travel to North Korea to accept the honor in person either . "
