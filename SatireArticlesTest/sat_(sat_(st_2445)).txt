Some aren ' t so thrilled about Derringer ' s restaurant . Shamika Main who was a former resident of Northeast Portland prior to the gentrification told us the following " I don ' t need no rich cracker pattin ' me on the head fore ' he throws a plate of slop in front of me trying to say it makes up for all the stuff done in slavery times and messin ' up my old hood . That is straight up offensive ! Y ' all owes us a lot more than some grits and a cup of koolaid . Get your mind right ! "
