Disclaimer and mea culpa done , let ' s examine why Paris Hilton should be Saint Paris Of " The Simple Life " , the Saint for the 21st Century . First , a candidate for sainthood has to be dead at least five years . A tough one I ' ll admit , anyone who has seen any of Paris ' internet work knows she ' s very much alive and apparently able to unlatch her lower jaw bone at will . But several saints have had the rules bent a little on their behalf . So I choose to see Paris being dead as a metaphor with " The Simple Life " pretty much flat , her CD that went lead and that great turn in " House of Wax " , let ' s face it she ' s flat lined .
