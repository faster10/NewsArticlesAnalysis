Mr DeLay , despite winning the Republican primary for his office , has announced his retirement as Representative of Texas ' s 22nd District rather than , as he put it , " Watching my ass get kicked by some Liberal in November . " Under indictment in a money laundering probe initiated by Austin prosecutor Ronnie Earle , Mr DeLay has also been accused of illegally soliciting campaign contributions , laundering campaign contributions to influence state legislative races and the improper use of his office to influence various federal agencies . Rebuked by a House Ethics Committee at the end of September 2004 for pressuring a fellow member of the House to switch his vote on a health care bill , Mr DeLay has also been subpoenaed to give information regarding his use of the Federal Aviation Administration to track down a plane owned by a rival Texas Democrat who fled the state rather than allow Mr DeLay to illegally change voting district boundaries to aid his fellow Republicans . An all around good guy who ' ll be missed .
