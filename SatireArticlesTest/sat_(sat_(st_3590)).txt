Upon impact , DU munitions burn at 3000 to 6000 degrees Centigrade and combust into a radioactive gas of fine particles of uranium oxide dust , which remain suspended in the air and , once inhaled , become a chronic source of uranium heavy metal and contact radiation poisoning . Estimates vary on the total tonnage of DU used by the US and include : during the US bombing of Yugoslavia , 34 tons of DU in Gulf War I , up to 375 tons in Afghanistan in 2001 , 1 , 000 tons and in Gulf War II in 2003 , up to 2 , 200 tons .
