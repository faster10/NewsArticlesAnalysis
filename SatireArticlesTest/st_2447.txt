PALABRA DE ODIO , NEW MEXICO Clem O ' Connor , 52 , describes himself as a " dyed in the wool " conservative Republican . He voted for George W . Bush twice and once each for John McCain though he says that was " mainly ' cause of Sarah Palin on the undercard " and Mitt Romney . The one subject he feels most strongly about is immigration reform . On that subject , like many conservative Republicans , Mr O ' Connor believes that border security and deportation are the two steps America must take to fix its broken immigration system , and he respects candidates who understand that , while disregarding any who give undocumented immigrants a path to citizenship , which is why he was " just totally confuzzled " about what he saw during the first Democratic Party presidential primary debate of the 2016 election season .
