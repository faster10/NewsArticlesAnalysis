Shop owner Holtz said she was well within her rights and does not discriminate . " He was getting very persnickety and didn ' t seem to like anything we had to offer . He said ' my wife wouldn ' t like this one bit ' and ' my wife wouldn ' t look good in that ' so many times I began to wonder if he had a wife at all ! He had on a wedding ring but anybody can buy a gold band . He said my eyeshadow was too heavy . I decided whatever his lifestyle , I didn ' t want to support it , so I asked him to leave which he did . "
