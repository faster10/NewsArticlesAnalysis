Forsythe says she ' s excited for the game ' s release . " I ' ve come up with some of EA ' s greatest innovations over the years . I ' m the person who decided we should re release The Sims ' every few years with the exact same expansion packs , which you have to buy all over again . I came up with Sim City BuildIt , ' our mobile game where people pay a hundred dollars for a handful of coins that can barely cover the cost of making a few buildings . And I ' m the one who decided all of our sports franchises should be re released each year , at full price , with only one or two minor changes from the year prior .
