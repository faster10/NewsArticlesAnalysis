The White House refused to comment on Libby ' s latest move , with newly hired counsel Ed Gillespie stating that they did not want to unduly influence any remaining appeals processes . " Our sympathies again go out to Mr Libby ' s wife , and he should rest assured that the Vice President personally intends to see that she and his family will be taken care of in his absence . The administration will also be scrutinizing the appellate pathway to assure that there are no obstacles to a fair and rapid disposition of Mr Libby ' s case . "
