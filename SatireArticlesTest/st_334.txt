" The line , ' The lunatic is on the grass ' comes in at the part of ' Sheep ' where the grazing sheep get agitated and kill the pigs . This can only be proof of the band ' s highly developed ability to weave motifs together . The band was , in fact , dabbling in ' mash up ' long before it became popular and accessible given digital technology . I ' d go as far as to say that years from now people , will not be talking about Pink Floyd in terms of albums rather , their whole streak from Dark Side to The Wall will be considered one album , probably with each record capable of being played simultaneously for additional layers of meaning and complexity .
