Treetop , for that is what he has named himself , scrabbles toward the light . After 17 years underground 17 dark and lonely years living on tree sap and hope he emerges , cold , frail , but alive . Fresh air thrills his lungs . The sky , so much brighter than he imagined , burns away the cloying decay that for so long defined him . But he does not linger on that past . He does not dwell in the what was . Instead , on instinct , he climbs . And he climbs . The tree on whose roots he survived becomes his ladder his path to a new life , a new start , in the Great Above . Up there , he tells himself , is the world he has dreamed of . Up there , just a little further , is a world of sunlight and song , of wings and flight and wonder . But then a bird eats him .
