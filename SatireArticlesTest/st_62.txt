The actual facts however , seem to have been a lot closer to what had been corroborated by many authors of Antiquity and the Middle Ages , such as Plutarch , Ibn ' Abd al Hakam , Al Massoudi and Leo the African . In 321 BC , on its way back to Macedonia , the funerary cart with Alexander ' s body was hijacked in Syria by one of his generals , Ptolemy I Soter . Ptolemy then diverted the body to Egypt where it was interred in Memphis , the center of Alexander ' s government in Egypt . Then , in the late 4th or early 3rd century BC , Alexander ' s body was transferred from Memphis to Alexandria , where it was reburied .
