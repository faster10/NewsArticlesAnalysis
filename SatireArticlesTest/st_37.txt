" We are trying to establish the actual age and identity of the boy explains Australian Federal Police Commander , Glen McEwen . " The boy is extremely nervous and aggressive when approached by humans . This made his capture quite complicated , especially since the kangaroos defended him viciously . We had to " tranquilize three of the adult marsupials using darts filled with sedatives , before we could lay our hands on the child . We really went to great lengths to make sure we did not injure him during the operation . Fortunately , the capture was a great success and the boy is unharmed . "
