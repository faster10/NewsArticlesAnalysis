Since the program ' s inception two months ago , the ER has served up over 4 dozen delicious charcoal smoothies catered to the specific tastes and allergies of each patient . " Oh , they ' re amazing an unidentified patient tells me during my tour of the ER . " I really only came here for a sandwich , maybe a norco , but thought quick at triage and told them I took twenty random pills I found on the sidewalk . Within 10 minutes , I ' m sipping on a Charcoalsicle dream . And , a little bit of this ( the patient partially exposes a small flask from his pocket ) really sets it off . "
