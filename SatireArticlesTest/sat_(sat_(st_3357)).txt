All politics is local except when it comes to who ' s paying for it . Then it becomes a national or now , even an international exercise . But I ' m happy to now see that shadowy foreign governments and corporations are finally investing in America , albeit in the form of paying American actors and ad companies to do political spots , giving jobs to workers in the Political Action Committees PACs ( hey , those guys have kids to feed too . ) and putting untraceable cash directly into our elected representative ' s pockets so they don ' t have to burden our budget process with pesky pay raises . They still will , but at least they don ' t have to . All of these things are good for our economy . Sure , it may be terrible for our society , but when fire departments let people ' s animals burn to death over a 75 . 00 fee , you know our society is shot to pieces anyway , so that ' s a non issue .
