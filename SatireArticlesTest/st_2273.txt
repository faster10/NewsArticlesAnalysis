" Here we go again , Sean , " said Cheney , at the start of the interview . " This lawsuit is a clear example of politics being played out at the expense of my father in particular , and the GOP in general . I think it ' s fair game to point out that the family of the donor contributed to Obama ' s campaign not once , but twice . It ' s a matter of public record . My father waited nearly two years for his operation and there was no special consideration made for him because of his position . No one seems to mention that . This is all politically motivated . It ' s a a cheap grab for attention and another ridiculous stunt we ' re witnessing , and it ' s all coming from the liberal left ' s increasing media control since Obama arrived in Washington . "
