In this seventh and final stage , a provider is repeatedly exposed to admissions in a very short time frame , leading to a psychological mindset where everything is perceived as futile but hilarious . A provider often thinks , " Wow , so much for good care haha . " or " Why relax on a beach when you can admit 85 drug seekers in 1 hour hehe ? . " Rectal bleeds ooze amusement and glee ( " LOL . " ) , diabetic foot ulcers reek laughter and merriment ( " ROFL ! . " ) , and vaginal secretions leak gaiety and fun ( " LMFAO ! ! . " ) . It is a learned helplessness and is by far the most important defense mechanism for surviving the admission process .
