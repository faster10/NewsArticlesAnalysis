" Picture a situation where you ' re sitting on a plane , " said Carson , " and this person sits next to you maybe an immigrant , maybe the security ' s wasn ' t working that day . They could have a whole pack of that stuff strapped to their chest or stuck to their shoe . And let ' s say that gum is slipped into the beverage cart to incapacitate hero passengers . Then the terrorism could happen right there . 30 , 000 feet above everyone or even right on the tarmac . It ' s a frightening thing to imagine , but these are the things I think about on a daily basis . "
