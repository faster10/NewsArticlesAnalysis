In the name of protecting the sanctity of life they seek to ban not only the big bugaboo of 21st century American politics , abortion , they ' ll also fight like hell to stop stem cell research , the results of which could save untold thousands of lives of those suffering from Alzheimer ' s , Multiple Sclerosis and myriad other ailments . They ' ve already tried to take the decision about whether you or those that know and love you best have the right to " pull the plug " and end your suffering . Remember that other Republican candidate for President , Bill Frist and his video diagnoses of poor Teri Schaivo ? That was about you and your family too . Of course , such attempts to save lives would have more validity if those making the attempt didn ' t get us sucked in to an unnecessary war that has so far taken more than 2 , 200 American and quite possibly more than 100 , 000 Iraqi lives . They would also seem more valid if the people making these attempts were not also defending the use of torture as a valid interrogation technique .
