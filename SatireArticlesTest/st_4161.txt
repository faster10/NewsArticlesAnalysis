But Mr Wolf then goes off topic a bit and cites Rep . Henry Hyde ' s bill HR 1658 , which is about the government ' s right to seize your shit , and it ' s incorporation , along with a raft of other laws , into the Patriot Act . Even so , it ' s an interesting point . He tells us that ' There are over 200 U . S . laws and violations mentioned in the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 and the Patriot Act that can subject property to civil asset forfeiture ' . I ' ll admit right here and now I didn ' t read them all ( hell , I haven ' t read any of them ) , but I did read some lawmakers comments on HR 1658 and I can tell you not everyone was wildly supportive of it .
