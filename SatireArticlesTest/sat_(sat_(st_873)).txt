Every once in awhile you ' ll come across a doctor who refuses to give you IV Dilaudid . Don ' t fret ! Your options . First , if you ' re hospitalized , just wait until the next shift comes on and bug THAT provider . If you ' re persistent , that person will cave and give you at least a one dose of Dilaudid . Second , if the people in that hospital are really trying to " do the right thing , " just sign out against medical advice , leave AMA , and try another hospital . No harm , no foul ! Your doctor or nurse won ' t suspect a thing ! The best part about EDs is you can use them instead of primary care clinics and it ' s much easier to get in .
