In 2007 , a joint Turkish Hong Kong expedition including members of Noah ' s Ark Ministries International ( NAMI ) also claimed to have found an unusual cave with fossilized wooden walls on Mount Ararat , well above the vegetation line . In 2010 , NAMI released videos of their discovery of the wood structures . Members of Noah ' s Ark Ministries International reported carbon dating suggests the wood is approximately 4 , 800 years old . It is unlikely that there was any human settlement at the site at altitude of 4 , 000 meters . Randall Price , a partner with Noah ' s Ark Ministries International from early 2008 to the summer of 2008 , stated that the discovery was probably the result of a hoax , perpetrated by ten Kurdish workers hired by the Turkish guide used by the Chinese , who planted large wood beams taken from an old structure near the Black Sea at the cave site .
