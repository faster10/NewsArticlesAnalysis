She goes off to thump the melons or something , so I amble over to the Deli counter . " How ' s the roast beef today ? " , I ask the woman behind the counter conversationally . " I don ' t know , I don ' t eat Deli meats . " , she replies , somewhat sullenly , I think . " Really ? Why not ? " " I don ' t like the way Deli meat tastes . " She gives her hairnet a surly tug . " That ' s a bit ironic , isn ' t it ? " , I chuckle . " Why ? " she asks , her tone quite frankly challenging . She was beginning to scare me , but I push on . " Well , " I stammer , " it just seems odd that someone who doesn ' t like Deli cooked meats would be assigned to the Deli counter . " Was this so hard to grasp ? " Look " , she said , clearly annoyed , " Do you like lima beans ? " " Uh , no . " I don ' t know what scared me more , that she seemed ready to vault the counter and pop me one or the fact that she immediately pegged me as someone who hated lima beans . Does that kind of thing show ? " So if you worked here and someone wanted to buy a can of lima beans , would you have to sell it to them ? " " I guess so . " This was getting distinctly uncomfortable . I started backing up a step or two , ready to bolt if need be . " Well ? ! " she fairly screamed . I turned to run and bumped smack into my wife , who hissed , " What in the world are you doing ? Now come with me and don ' t get lost again . "
