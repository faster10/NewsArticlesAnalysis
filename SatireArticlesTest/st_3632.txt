United States President George W . Bush , speaking at the swearing in ceremony of Alberto Gonzales as Attorney General , has called for a renewal of the notorious USA Patriot Act . Mr Bush called on Congress to not only renew all the existing provisions of the Bill , but to extend already the sweeping law enforcement powers contained therein . Mr Bush said , " We must not allow the passage of time or the illusion of safety to weaken our resolve in this new war . Don ' t you understand ? You ' re all gonna die ! You ' re children and families are gonna die ! They ' re coming for us even as I speak ! Murder ! War ! Pestilence ! The Seven Horsemen ! Arrgghh ! " At this point Mr Bush fell to the floor foaming at the mouth and began speaking in tongues . The White House has vowed to Veto any relaxation of the current law , no matter how rational or well thought out .
