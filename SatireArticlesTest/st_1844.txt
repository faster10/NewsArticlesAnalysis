" This party ' s platform will be pretty strict . There ' s no wiggle room in what Mr Beck hopes to accomplish , " says one such insider , who asked that we only identify her as a former Fox News employee . " He wants to make Christianity America ' s official ' religion . English would be the official ' language . he wants to get rid of all Federal taxes . He wants to privatize the military , the police , the fire departments , education , everything , and make the government small enough that it can be supported by tariffs only . He wants to deregulate everything , too . And he wants to make it a law that the only things we should teach in our schools are the Holy Bible and the Constitution . ' If you ask me , it ' s a little too extreme , but he asked me to consult him , so I ' ll consult . "
