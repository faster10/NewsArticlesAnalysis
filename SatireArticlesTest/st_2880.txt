It ' s like BP is driving down the road , probably drunk , in this big ol ' Hummer , and it crashes into something . Now a passenger in BP ' s car we ' ll say that represents some of their employees dies , and that ' s bad . And a few passengers in the back we ' ll say that ' s folks who live and work around the Gulf are injured . That ' s also bad . But the thing is , what the Hummer crashed into was a school . The size of Kansas . And everyone in it died . And that ' s us . See ?
