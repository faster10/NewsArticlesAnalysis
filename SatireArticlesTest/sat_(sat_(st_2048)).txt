LAKE CHAUVIN , FLORIDA Lance Westmund is a 52 year old self described Born Again Christian , Republican , gun owner , and current line cook at the local Chik Fil A in his small Florida town . He says that in this year ' s election Dr Ben Carson has his support for the Republican nomination because of Carson ' s " intelligence and soft spoken support of systemic misogyny in the name of cultural and religious purity . " Westmund told our reporter that abortion is the most important issue facing America today , despite the Roe vs . Wade Supreme Court decision that gave women the right to have an abortion up to the point of medical viability for the gestating fetus , because " an amoral , Godless , baby killing America is not an America God would want . " Mr Westmund says that just like Carson , he wants abortion made illegal and there to be almost no exceptions for any circumstance , including if the abortion if or a victim of rape or incest .
