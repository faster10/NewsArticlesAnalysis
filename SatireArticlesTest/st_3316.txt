People would begin to realize that the other guy isn ' t so bad just because he dresses , eats and worships differently . Life could be beautiful there . And of course , if it didn ' t work out , if the various groups found they just couldn ' t live together in peace and harmony , we go ahead with Plan B and nuke the place out of existence . Just think about it is all I ' m asking . Hell , I ' ll even negotiate on the twelve mil and go down to fifteen rooms , as long as I still have a separate master bath and a Jacuzzi . But the fenced yard stays , no matter what .
