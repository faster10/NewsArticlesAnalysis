Guantanamo , Cuba ( Rotters ) After musing over nonspecific " gut feelings " in an interview with the Chicago Tribune editorial board yesterday , Homeland security chief Michael Chertoff was suddenly rushed late last night to Guantanamo Bay Cuba for emergent medical care . Chertoff had initially ascribed the gut feeling and discomfort to what he believed would be an imminent Al Qaeda attack on America sometime this summer . Chertoff , later that evening collapsed at home , and after being examined by White House physicians was determined to have a serious medical problem .
