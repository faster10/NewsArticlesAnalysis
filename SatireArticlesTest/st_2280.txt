Herb Stadanko , former Army Sergeant and member of Patriots United for Freedom ( PUFF ) , has been fighting against immigration reform since 2008 . Stadanko believes President Obama is purposely catering to illegal aliens in hopes of creating future Democrats . " Last time I checked , marijuana was still illegal at the federal level , so what does that tell you ? Herb asked . " The President said it himself , by hook or by crook . All that ' s left to do now is medicate the populace , keep them high and happy and voting Democrat . "
