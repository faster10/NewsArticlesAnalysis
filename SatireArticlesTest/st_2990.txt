A very intelligent , female , brown M M is talking at a party . She discusses how people always think she is " naked , " and rolls her Ivy League elitist eyes . Then a male red M M shows up , sees brown M M , and says , " So it ' s that kind of party . " Red M M strips off his shell , revealing his naked brown body , and starts to dance . That the star of the show is brown and smart and Michelle Obama is the obvious part . The red M M threw me until I realized that red is the color of communism , and when you strip away their fa ade , you ' ll find a brown man . In the White House !
