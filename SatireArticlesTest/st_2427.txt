When asked about the stunt later that day , Paul said he ' s " absolutely jazzed " about the video . He said that " young people get that cheap stunts are more important than substance . " Senator Paul also made sure to mention " free market " and " audit the Fed " a dozen times apiece in the span of a five minute Q A session with reporters . " Kids today don ' t care if your policy ideas come from the 19th century and were necessarily deemed not quite adequate for making a better society , " Paul said , " they just want to see whacky stunts . I ' m thinking of doing parkour in the next video actually . Anything to make me look hip for the youngsters out there , even if it doesn ' t remotely help my chances of winning . "
