As far as several sources in the State Capitol have been able to tell , Governor Brown has not showered or bathed in any capacity since early April . The sources believe that Brown ' s statement during the meeting mentioned by Martinez was a serious plan of action taken by the Governor . " His clothes look clean still , but I heard that he has everything he wears dry cleaned now , since he allegedly thinks dry cleaning doesn ' t use any water , " explained one source . " No one really has the heart to tell him that the dry cleaning process does create toxic waste water . "
