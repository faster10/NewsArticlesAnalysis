The amount of treasure and the number of sacrificed animals and people , have immediately led the archaeologists to consider that the site was certainly the burial site of a really powerful Mongol warlord . After realizing an extensive set of tests and analysis , they were able to confirm that the body belonged to a man aged between 60 and 75 , who died between 1215 and 1235 AD . Both the age , the date , the location and the opulence of the site seem to confirm that the tomb does indeed belong to Genghis Khan .
