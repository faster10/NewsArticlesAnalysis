I rode into town around eight or nine o ' clock at night Reagan had been shot around 2 : 30 or so . John Hinckley had of course been arrested right away , but no one , especially the DC Police , knew if it had been a random act or part of a larger conspiracy . It would be days before the irony of an old , crazy , grade B actor who miraculously had landed the role of his life had been shot by a young , crazy guy in order to impress an even younger , far better actor would be revealed .
