Auction site eBay will split its service into eBay Lite and eBay Premium . Using Lite , sellers can continue to list items for free . The 14 . 95 Premium service , however , allows them to display a picture of the item , a description of the item , a price for the item , accept bids on the item , and get paid if the item sells . " It ' s really an all in one package of service solutions , " said eBay spokesman Kurt Shriff , who added the company was justified in charging for the package because it had never done so before .
