Rookie physician assistant Erica Blackstone made headlines last week when she cleaned house in her 10 bed observation unit with 10 straight discharges in 10 hours . She was 30 minutes away in her bid for a perfect day when it was broken up by a late admission from the ED . Blackstone will likely be a major factor down the road , especially in the event of a playoff push . On the other hand , veteran Bill Oxford continues to have major struggles , time and again forgetting to admit or discharge patients , therefore bringing up the question of retirement . At the very least , he ' s a fantasy dud . Free up space on your team and let Oxford go . Hot : Blackstone . Not : Oxford .
