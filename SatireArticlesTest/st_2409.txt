Kimberly Garson , a junior event organizer with the Reagan campaign , filed a report to her superior , Ken Hammberg , that refers to SIX children , " sort of unattended by their folks " , making an otherwise unremarkable bus trip to a Ventura campaign stop " particularly difficult " .

W . Bush was taking place at a popular local restaurant called Coog ' s House Of Pancakes , in Santa Barbara , later that same day .
