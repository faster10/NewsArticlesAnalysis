It ' s not that I ' m far too parochial in my thinking , although I readily admit that I am . It ' s just that when you ' re an American suffering under the yoke of the worst President in 230 years , depending on when you start keeping count ( and for those of you too lazy to do the math , you can just read that sentence as in for ever ) , you start to think that everything has to do with your country and it ' s leader . . And I don ' t think it ' s just me either . Over the last eight years it seems everybody else in the world thought everything that happened well , everything bad at least also had to do with the United States and George Bush . But it ' s not true .
