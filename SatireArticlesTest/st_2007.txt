Tim ' s father , Gerald Martin , contacted the press to make the following statement regarding the topic , " These celebrities don ' t realize how their actions or lack thereof can seriously affect the relationship they have with their fans , I mean the type situation my son found himself in is completely devastating for the fan . It is also life threatening because I can assure you that it sucks the life right out of any fan ' s motivation or desire to continue their support . " Mr Martin concluded his interview by saying , " If this Justin Bieber guy isn ' t careful , he ' ll eventually piss off all of his fans and nobody is going to want to pay him to sing , at only 21 years old , that would be a bummer . "
