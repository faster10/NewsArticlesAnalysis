Authorities say Rubio was ordered to present a green card . When Rubio explained he was born in Miami , both officers drew their pistols , called for backup , and ordered him to show his driver ' s license , birth certificate , social security card , passport , high school yearbook photo , and two pieces of mail in his name . He was also asked to provide the phone number of a Caucasian friend who would vouch for him . But Rubio did not have his social security card on his person , so the police decided to arrest him .
