But Mazda historian Gregory Holden says he isn ' t surprised by the discoveries and he ' s expecting a lot more . " Mazda is a company with a real racing legacy , and a decade ago , all of their cars showed that pedigree . The 2005 Mazda 6 had a 220 horsepower 6 cylinder engine and could do zero to sixty in about seven seconds , not counting the Mazdaspeed version . The 2015 Mazda 6 , which doesn ' t have a Mazdaspeed version at all , has a 184 horsepower 4 cylinder engine and does zero to sixty in roughly the length of the movie Braveheart . ' The tampons are probably an effort from some engineer to slow the car down further and make it more polite than the grittier , tougher , faster Mazda 6 ' s of old , but I ' m just floating that .
