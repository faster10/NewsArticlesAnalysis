In 1848 , gold was discovered somewhere else in California , which at the time wasn ' t part of the United States but made us want it really bad , and settlers came pouring into the wonderful natural harbor of San Francisco Bay . When they actually got out of the harbor and dried off , they went in search of the gold , which they then brought back to San Francisco to spend on hookers , opium , booze and Transvestites . It was a kindler , gentler time , with stabbings , lynchings and men being Shanghaied as sailors , but very few drive by shootings . Spurred on by the lack of good Laundromats , Chinese immigrants also arrived from Shanghai , bringing with them opium and starch . Racial tensions began to emerge as the residents found the Asians to be a bit too stiff for their liking , but cutting back on the starches and loading up on the opium accomplished what diplomacy could not . As a result of the starch reduction people became thinner and better looking as a result of the opium people became muuuuccch happier and began to build really pretty houses .
