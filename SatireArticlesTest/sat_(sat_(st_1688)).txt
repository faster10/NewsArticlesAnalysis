MS : Not always . I ' m a human being , dude . I sometimes disagree with the band ' s direction . The other night , they went into a blues groove during " Plunger " and it petered out at around : 37 seconds in , but the band kept it going to give Joel some noodling time . I was yawnin ' it , dude , and don ' t get me wrong , I love Joel , dude . It wasn ' t until 1 : 54 that Jake initiated a hard rock ' tar riff with Eddie Van Halen finger tapping . That sent the whole crowd into a bouncy rage and blew everyone ' s mind .
