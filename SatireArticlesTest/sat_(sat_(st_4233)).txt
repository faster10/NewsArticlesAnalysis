Anyway , I ' m glad you shut all that stuff down , or at least you said you did . I have enough problems in the Middle East ( which was really all Don Rumsfeld ' s fault , I admit it ) without you running around saying you ' re gonna blow up the Far East too . Even if that ' s your plan , if you could just hold off saying anything about it till after the elections next year I ' ll send you all the champagne , hair gel and White movies you want . Free .
