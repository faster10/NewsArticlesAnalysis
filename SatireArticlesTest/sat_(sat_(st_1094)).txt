A black cloud gets no more than eight minutes of sleep and it often takes place in an improvised spot : the empty bed of a recently deceased patient , the top of a conference room table , or on three swivel chairs of roughly the same height . If a black cloud happens to find a free call room bed , he or she will catch scabies . A black cloud ' s few moments of rest are always interrupted by a patient ' s acute change in medical condition .
