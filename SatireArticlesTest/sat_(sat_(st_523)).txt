" I was so close to killing myself until I got my first iPod , " said AiDD sufferer Tanya Williamson , student at VI Madison and research assistant in the School of Psychology . " Thank God my parents intervened and bought me one for my birthday last year , which really saved my life . Of course , it wasn ' t a Nano , so now I ' ve got to go through all of this again and refrain from slitting my wrists until I can get my hands on one of those . The government really needs to step up their willingness to help get me a goddamn iPod , or I ' m going to die . "
