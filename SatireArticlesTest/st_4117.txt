The Manifesto is available as an app from the i Tunes store ( cost 16 . 99 , but you also get a free download of the ' Collected Works of Karl Pilkington ' , a 20 . 00 value , included as well ) It may also be found in book form at your local Wal Mart ( minus the Karl Pilkington download ) in the Lawn Garden Department , near the five gallon pails of Ortho Round up . For more information and a schedule of TP events , speak to your local TP representative usually it ' s your Republican Committee , Council or Congressman . If they tell you they ' re not in the Tea Party , don ' t worry just keep calling and calling them or stand outside their homes until they break down and admit it . Then go away because they ' re lying to you . Such is the nature of 21st Century politics .
