CATO praised the many states that cut taxes every year from 1995 to 2000 , while condemning those that increased taxes and spending . Mississippi , Arkansas and West Virginia scored low because they increased spending from 1991 to 2002 , while Hawaii , Wyoming and Arizona scored high by increasing spending in lesser amounts . The calculations use 15 variables based on state spending , revenue and tax rates , and purport to show that states with the lowest taxes are best . Indeed , CATO finds the so called Bush economic recovery , is based on Bush ' s tax cuts for the wealthiest taxpayers .
