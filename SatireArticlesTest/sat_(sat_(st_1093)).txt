A white cloud gets no new patients . Or if they get one , that patient is always a pleasant , straightforward , but interesting case . A white cloud gets a full night of undisturbed sleep on an unusually comfortable bed with freshly washed linens . A black cloud sees anywhere from 30 to 30 , 000 patients , all of whom are best labeled as " train wrecks , " and they all happen to arrive at the same time , sometimes life flighted and usually intubated . They are all poor historians .
