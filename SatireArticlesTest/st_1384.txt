When these products were offered to the local hospital , many providers were skeptical . " I was bothered by the lack of scientific credibility , " says trauma surgeon Dr Trevor Winters . " I ' m not a big believer in that stuff . " But after seeing the products used by others in his practice , Dr Winters was convinced . " Homeopathic blood products seem to be very effective as the initial resuscitation fluid in mild to moderate traumatic blood loss . Transfusing two liters of homeopathic blood , rapid push , does seem to stabilize patients until the ' allopathic ' blood bank gets around to sending their units . I was a skeptic at first , but you can ' t argue with results . "
