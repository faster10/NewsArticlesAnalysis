A history lesson : back in the Sixties , when the fight for Civil Rights , Women ' s Liberation and the protests against Vietnam War were raging , members of all these organizations formed demonstrations and held rally ' s , marched from city to city , boycotted organizations that were against them and burned their draft cards and bras in protest . And in response they were beaten by police and Union workers , jailed or lynched and in one extreme case , even shot to death by the Ohio National Guard . The protests were happening because people were being blocked from voting , buying houses and drinking at water fountains because of the color of their skin , dismissed because of their gender and or being forced against their will to fight and die in a very controversial war , one that by the end of the day cost 58 , 000 lives .
