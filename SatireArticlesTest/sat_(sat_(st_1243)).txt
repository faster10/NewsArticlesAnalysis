" Proposition 23 . 4 addresses two immense problems , " said Krysinski . " First , it will protect those humans who cannot get vaccines either due to a young age , immunodeficiency , or other real contraindication to vaccines . Secondly , it will protect the innocent children of parents who chose not to vaccinate from acquiring disease since they will be in a closed environment . Those poor kids they have to deal with their crazy parents . They don ' t even stand a chance at being normal themselves in the future . "
