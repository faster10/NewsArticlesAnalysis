The lumbar puncture ( LP ) or spinal tap ( 11 ) is extremely helpful for diagnostic purposes whether or not the results are positive . It is also a noninvasive procedure if you don ' t factor in all the needles and stuff . We won ' t go into the details of how to perform a lumbar puncture , but we will remind the reader of three things : ( 1 ) use landmarks , ( 2 ) observe sterile technique , and ( 3 ) insert needle with running start . Some will argue that this is not part of the neurologic exam . I would argue that they are probably correct .
