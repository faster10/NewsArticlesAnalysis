" From our charts , we can see that the U . S . Dollar is falling against the Linden . If too many people become engrossed with virtual world economies , we could see a downward spiral for the Dollar . Eventually , there could be a situation in which people trade the Dollar for virtual currencies . This could create a trade deficit of sorts between real world goods and virtual world goods , causing our entire economy to get sucked up into a virtual world . Americans could end up standing in virtual bread lines , and living out on virtual streets , facing virtual poverty , in a virtual recession . " said Secretary Paulson .
