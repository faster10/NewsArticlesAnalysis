Later that day a nurse on 4 west , the hospital ' s telemetry unit , had another scare . " My heart had a short pause , I knew I didn ' t have this Pok mon in my Pok dex . I calmly threw a Pok ball but he scurried off . I had no idea it wasn ' t a Pok mon until I heard multiple other people couldn ' t catch it either . " She continued , " As with everything around here it was too good to be true . "
