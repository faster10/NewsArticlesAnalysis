The Feminine Hygiene , Condiments and Hair Care aisles passed uneventfully , ( except for a small squirt of hairspray in my left eye , but that sort of thing happens all the time ) and Paper Products took less than five minutes to re stack the toilet paper rolls . So it seemed that I would get out of there without further problems , that is until my wife said , " Oh , I forgot to get carrots . Go back to Produce and get me a bunch . "
