White House press secretary Josh Earnest characterized Republican talking points concerning the fiscal crisis at the IRS as " pure fantasy " . " The Republican party created this problem with their hair brained decision to shut down the Government . This forced the President ' s hand , requiring him to shift IRS organizational funds to meet the demand of immediate federal spending needs . And now they balk , refuse to authorize reparation of funds back into IRS coffers while trying to lay the blame at the Presidents feet . The Republicans need to stop playing politics and act on this now , before the refunds of millions of Americans are placed in jeopardy . "
