The negative reaction to this initiative , although somewhat damaging to the brand , has in fact focused attention on the race issue in spite of itself . " There ' s no such thing as bad publicity , " said a Starbucks manager in New York City ' s Times Square . " My Starbucks is always busy , but this morning was insane . Same thing for the Starbucks across the street , and the Starbucks around the corner , and the one down the block , and of course the Starbucks above this Starbucks . I think the initiative works better in urban areas like New York where there are lot of different people all over the place . It ' s like the United Nations in here sometimes . "
