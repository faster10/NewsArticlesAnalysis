" I was skimming through the chapters , taking notes , and that ' s when I saw the Obama chapter , " says 10th grade history teacher Mary Wallace , 47 , of Dallas . " I ' ve never been so offended in all my life . I didn ' t vote for him , and I don ' t support him , but the things these books had in them I don ' t have the words to describe how much hate these books were filled with . These should never be seen by children . They shouldn ' t be seen by anyone . "
