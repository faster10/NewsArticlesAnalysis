Religious upbringing A Christian woman of purity is not concerned with exposing her bodily goodness to those around her and is thus less likely to even be confronted by a male that has coital ambitions . Most feminists are atheists , lesbian , or both , which as explained above , increases the likelihood in the female mind that rape or sexual misconduct is occurring . It has been proven that a conditioned result or desire which is prepared for is most likely to occur in both a real or imagined context . A devout woman with a love for Jesus will cover from her collarbone down to her ankles and offer very little to be imagined in a male ' s loins whereas no noticeable trouser twitching may be discerned . Knowledge of this will allow for the religious woman to free her mind of the victimhood impulses that would lead to a complaint .
