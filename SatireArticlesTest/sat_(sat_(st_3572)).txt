Not only is Exxon Mobil a truly repulsive corporate entity . it has been revealed that they paid pseudo scientists to debunk global warming but sadly , the Bush government has taken no action to force the company to meet its legal obligations regarding the oil spill , allowing them to continue along this path of profits , profits , profits , for themselves as well as the Bush , Cheney oil gang . I urge you to boycott Exxon Mobil and its products ! This repulsive company is feeding on artificially inflated gas prices at your pump and is desperately fighting to prevent and debunk every source of alternate energy except fossil fuel .
