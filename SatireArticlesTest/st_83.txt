The federal and state authorities were well aware that a nuclear warhead had been lost in the area in the 1950 ' s and had never been recovered , but no efforts had been done for years to recover it . It was lost on the night of February 5 , 1958 , when a B 47 Stratojet bomber carrying the 7 , 600 pound hydrogen bomb on a simulated combat mission off the coast of Georgia collided with an F 86 Saberjet fighter at 36 , 000 feet of altitude . The collision destroyed the fighter and severely damaged a wing of the bomber , leaving one of its engines partially dislodged .
