The controversy began at a campaign stop in Salem , Virginia over the weekend , when Senator Marco Rubio questioned the size of Mr Trump ' s manhood . " He ' s always calling me Little Marco ' and I ' ll admit he ' s taller than me , he ' s 6 ' 2 which is why I don ' t understand why he has hands the size of someone who ' s 5 ' 2 . Have you seen his hands ? You know what they say about men with small hands , " Rubio said pausing for dramatic effect before adding , " You can ' t trust them . Alright ? You can ' t trust them . " The crowd gathered for the senator ' s rally erupted into howls of laughter following the well timed dick joke .
