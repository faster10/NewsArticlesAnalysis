" Melania has written all kinds of powerful speeches in the last few months , " Trump said as he was taking a bite of a doughnut , " she ' s got that talks about four score and seven years ago . She ' s got another that talks about how there are small steps for man , but giant leaps for mankind . And my favorite speech of hers that she has written all be herself is the one where she thanks Yankee fans for loving her , despite her having to quit the game early because of the mysterious disease she has contracted , and she says she ' s the luckiest man on the face of the earth . That ' s a friggin ' great speech ! "
