So I had to go to the doctor yesterday well , not exactly the doctor , but the Physicians Assistant . I had a sore throat , you see , and that doesn ' t actually rate a doctor . I call the office , go through the sixteen voice prompts and after only twenty minutes ( Luckily , I love to listen to Boy George ' s ' Do You Really Want To Hurt Me ' through my phone over and over again . ) get through to an actual human being .
