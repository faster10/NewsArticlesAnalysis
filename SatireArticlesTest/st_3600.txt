Anyway , Fox also reported that the " latest New York Times CBS news poll shows 92 percent of Tea Party members fear moves toward socialism . Fifty two percent of 1 , 580 adults surveyed saw the same drift but 38 percent did not . " . I ' m not sure exactly what that means . I didn ' t see the question or who they asked they could ' ve been standing at a Tea Party rally for all I know . Anyway , it ' s not important , because I fear Socialism too I ' m not sociable either people are a real pain in the ass . But people equate Socialism with Communism , mostly because the Soviets used the word Socialism in their name and who wants to be a Commie ? Using that logic , we should also fear Democracy and a Republic ( which the United States is ) because the Democratic Republic of Congo uses those words in their name and they keep cutting off people ' s arms . The also confuse " Socialism " with " Social Programs " such as Medicare and Medicaid , Social Security , food stamps and unemployment insurance many of the same programs I ' ll bet a lot of the Tea Partier ' s use themselves . I mean , have you looked at these people ?
