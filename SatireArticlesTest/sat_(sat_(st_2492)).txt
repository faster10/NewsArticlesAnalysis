" We live in a racially segregated country today . A country where whites are discriminated against because we ' re white , and for no other reason , " Limbaugh said on his radio show on Thursday . " We aren ' t allowed to acknowledge what whites have contributed to this country . There are no holidays or celebratory months ' devoted to white people , or our achievements , or our history . We can ' t even say the phrase white pride ' without being called racists . "
