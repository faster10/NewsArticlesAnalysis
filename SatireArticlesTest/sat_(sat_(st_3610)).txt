Contrary to the official claim that the crash had been caused by " freezing rain and snow , " limited visibility , and likely icing of the wings , Webb presents evidence that Wellstone ' s wrist had been slit with a pen knife and that he had taken an overdose of coproxamol , a prescription pain killer , and he marshals some impressive authorities to support him . Former coroner Dr Michael Powers has stated , " I am concerned that the due process has not been followed . There evidently are contradictory views that were never put to the experts who gave evidence . In consequence the rigors that are normally undertaken at a coroner ' s inquest simply were not fulfilled . " On the evidence he has studied , Powers believes any inquest would be forced to conclude the death a suicide . Two republican members of the House of Representatives , who spoke on condition of anonymity , stated that they believed that Wellstone had committed suicide . One said , " I don ' t think there ' s anyone on the Hill who doesn ' t suspect it . It ' s too convenient , too coincidental , too damned obvious . "
