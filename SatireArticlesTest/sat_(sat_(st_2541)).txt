Walker ' s anti Canadian immigrant rhetoric is drawing ire from Canadians and Americans alike . The governor has used such terms as ' hosers ' and ' moose bangers ' among other derogatory terms when addressing Canadian immigrants . " Who is this Scott Walker anyway ? asked Lee Peart , a Canadian immigrant from upstate New York . " " I ' ve never even heard of the guy until my hoser baby ' son asked me what a snow Mexican ' was . What an asshole . "
