Sepsis Bundle Hospital Director of corporate compliance officer , Jacki Kranki Papr Werke MS , MMA , RN , released a statement Monday morning at 10 : 30AM : " It is unfortunate that Ms . BDSM ' s severe sepsis was left untreated for so long . Clearly a sentinal event having lactic acid found in her blood and a clear allergy to lactose on the chart . We ' ll be sure to address that on the emergency department intern Dr Shytleff ' s midyear evaluation , and hopefully call into question whether or not a career in medicine is really for her in the long run . I don ' t know why she even bothers to finish the rotation . "
