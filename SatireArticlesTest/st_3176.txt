MR . CUNNINGHAM : Who were you talking to , Cole ? BOY : Poor Mr Cunningham . My favorite teacher . But he didn ' t know squat about e commerce . COLE : No one . Thanks for picking my business idea as this semester ' s Junior Achievement project , Mr Cunningham . MR . CUNNINGHAM : No problem , Cole . You deserve it . It ' s a great idea : an e business consultancy where you help companies by studying the failures of previous dot coms . But frankly , it will be hard to research . Failed companies don ' t like to talk about it , you know .
