Today is D Day for Cindy Sheehan , the grieving mother of Army Specialist Casey Sheehan who was killed in the Sadr City section of Baghdad During the War of Error . Captain Kenneth Vanek of the McLeenan County Sheriff ' s Department , bravely assisted by the United States Secret Service ( who , by their actions today , may show themselves to be a different type of Gold Star Mothers ) , must decide whether or not to make good on their threat to arrest this brave and determined woman as a Threat to the President , which , by the way , George W . Bush has let her become by his cowardly refusal to meet with her or even get anywhere within five miles of him as vacations on his Crawford spread . The Cowboy in Chief apparently feels he ' s already said everything he needed to at Ms . Sheehan ' s and his previous meeting when he expressed his condolences to " Mom " for the loss of her " Son Daughter Husband Wife Loved One . "
