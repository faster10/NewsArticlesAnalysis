Bush , alone , may not be responsible for record spending in the last election , the most expensive in history at 3 . 9 billion . But is he responsible for nearly half of all lawmakers who retire from the Senate and House 52 percent of Republicans and 33 percent of Democrats becoming lobbyists ? Did the 1 , 300 registered lobbyists who gave him more than 1 . 8 million over six years , the 52 lobbyists who raised more than 6 million for Bush ' s reelection , or the 100 former lobbyists whom Bush appointed to regulate business set new records or are they merely a reflection of money playing a larger role in politics ?
