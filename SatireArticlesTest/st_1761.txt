" An estimated 30 million Christmas trees are sold each year , and the brass at the EPA thinks this is far too many , " says one of the EPA officials . " These weigh about 70 pounds on average , so that ' s around 1 , 050 , 000 tons of fir trees that are cut down yearly , and most of that lumber never ends up getting used , in most places anyway . So the thinking is that by outlawing Christmas trees , we ' d cut out over a million tons of waste per year . "
