In this third stage , a provider tries to bargain or block to stave off the inevitable admission . A provider may ask the ED , " If you turf this to Cardiology , I ' ll be your best friend or " If you discharge this one , I swear I ' ll do the next one maybe . " Similar to anger , bargaining or blocking may be targeted at a supernatural source : " God , if you block this admission , I will never say a bad thing about Taylor Swift ever again . " In an extreme scenario , a provider may declare , " Admit me , just not anyone else . " The best example of a provider in this stage is U . S . goalkeeper and hospitalist Tim Howard .
