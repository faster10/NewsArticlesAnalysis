" If I wanted a local weather report , I would have stuck my big toe out the window , " said stay at home Dad Arthur Bates . " All they kept saying on the news was that ' authorities are trying to determine what caused the accident . ' I ' m no famous weatherman , " admitted Bates , " but you know , I ' ll be damned if I don ' t think it musta been caused by the snow . I ' m surprised they didn ' t have that Jim Cantore guy jumping up and down like a crazy nut over the whole thing . "
