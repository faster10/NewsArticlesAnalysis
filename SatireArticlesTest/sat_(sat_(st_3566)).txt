Forget that Sarah Palin ' s Alaska relies on 80 of it ' s revenue from an unsustainable resource oil , or they get twice as many federal dollars back as they pay in taxes or charge the highest property and business taxes in America more than even New York . Forget that Christina O ' Donnell out and out lied about her education and can ' t figure out the first amendment , forget that Rand Paul ( who gets half his income from Medicare payments ) wants to let redneck business owners refuse to serve people based on color or religion or whatever , Forget that Sharon Angle wants to force you , if your daddy raped you in a drunken rage , to have the baby . Forget all those positions . Or don ' t , cause these are the people you ' re holding up as heroes of the Tea Party . Is this what you really believe ?
