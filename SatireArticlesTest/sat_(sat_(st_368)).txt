" It reminds me of a story of a little boy named Timothy O ' Brien , " said Lively . " Little Timmy was only six years old , but was very smart . His mother , whom I ' ve had the pleasure of meeting through her very spirited letters to our corporation , bought him some of his favorite candies Now Laters while they were standing in the grocery store checkout line . After a considerable tantrum , Little Timmy finally persuaded his mother to let him have a Now Later while he was forced to stand there and watch adults do boring adult things . But that wasn ' t good enough for Timmy almost the instant after he put the first delicious piece of taffy in his mouth , he began to scream for Mommy to give him another one . Mommy tried to reason with him by saying , No , Timmy , you have to finish the one I gave you before you get another , ' but Little Timmy wasn ' t interested . Hell , hell , hell , Mommy , I want another shitty Now Later now , god damnit ! ' We can all thank Little Timmy and the many children like him who demand our candies to the point of getting spanked for taking the name of the Lord in vain for changing the face and name of the industry forever .
