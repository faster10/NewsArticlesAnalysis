" In my day , " said KKI founder William Barty , " clown cars made children of all ages laugh . Now when folks think of clown cars , do you know what comes to mind ? Planned Parenthood , Donald Trump , immigration , and politics all the sad things . People come to the circus to forget about those things , not to think about Ben Carson , Rand Paul , Mike Huckabee , and Carly Whoozie whatzis and her harvested fetus brains ! That doesn ' t sell tickets . "
