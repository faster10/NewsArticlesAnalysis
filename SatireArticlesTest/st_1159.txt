" INTOX brings you all the action and really makes it feel like you are there , " said director Anthony Waterby . " Most episodes start with at least one drunk patient coming in battling with staff verbally and physically , to include biting , spitting , and throwing feces . A few scenes the spit and blood actually hits the camera lens giving a super realistic look at what many nurses , doctors , EMTs , and security guards have to deal with on a daily basis . "
