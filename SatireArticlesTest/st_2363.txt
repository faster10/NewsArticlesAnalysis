Dawson was asked why a patient would decide to terminate a pregnancy that was well into the third trimester and replied , " It ' s honestly not as complex as people make it out to be , sure sometimes medical issues are at play but for the most part a patient may decide to terminate a pregnancy due changes in social status , financial status , or most commonly relationship status , it ' s not our place to judge the patients reasoning , but to provide the needed service , it ' s time we all realized that it ' s the woman ' s choice . "
