Voom acknowledged that CUL8R may not settle every question . Three years ago , scientists at Los Alamos predicted an asteroid three miles across that strikes the mid Atlantic Ocean would produce a tidal wave that would cover the East Coast of the United States to the Appalachian Mountains . It would also envelop the coasts of France and Portugal . Voom conceded CUL8R is not large enough to adequately test this model . However , he insisted , even a small tidal wave that only destroys Portugal would be useful in devising further experiments with the asteroid chute .
