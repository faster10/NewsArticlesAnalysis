Unnamed White House Source Wegman ( Pudgy ) Waterhouse , speaking on the condition of anonymity said , " While I gotta admit the phone thing was kinda cute and maybe even clinched the Election for ( Republican Senator John ) Sununu , the White House most certainly does not endorse the use of our secret accounts for something as trivial as phone calling . That ' s our bribe money and is supposed to be used to buy judges , slander opponents , fund roadblocks and disenfranchise minority voters . We worked hard to get that cash by allowing the rape of our environment by Big Oil , the decimation of the Bill of Rights by Religious Fundamentalists and kickbacks from no bid Halliburton Contracts . As far as we ' re concerned , Tobin can fry . "
