Arthropods have exoskeletons made up of three different layers : epidermis , epicuticle , and exocuticle . Orthopods do not have exoskeletons but still have three different layers : epidermis , scrubs , and a black fleece with a rad symbol or slogan on it . Arthropod exoskeletons are thick and strong , impermeable to stress . Orthopod skulls are thick and strong , impermeable to dialogue and suggestions . Arthropods have tremendously complex visual systems : compound eyes and ocelli . Orthopods have remarkably simple visual systems : " That ' s a bone . " or " That ' s not a bone . "
