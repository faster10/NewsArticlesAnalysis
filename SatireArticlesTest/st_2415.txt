All this started in the 1970 ' s , a decade of overall discontent and decline in both morality and entertainment . AC DC ' s assembly line of filth produced albums named Power Age , High Voltage , and Big Ballsbreaker . Songs paid homage to and encouraged gambling ( " Sin City " ) , STDs ( " The Jack Jack Jack Jack " ) , contempt for authority ( " Jail Break " and " Problem Child " ) , and even bisexual prostitution ( " Dirty Deeds , Done Dirt Cheap " ) . It was right after the release of the breakthrough smash long player , Highway to Hell , that Scott passed away after an alcoholic binge in a frozen automobile .
