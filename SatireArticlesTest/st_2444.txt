" Our guests appreciate the fact that we have taken the time to research and replicate the foods that they resonate with the most and that correctly represent their cultures and lifestyles . For instance , most people in the mainstream are completely unaware that militant feminist lesbians subsist on a diet primarily of oatmeal and cold gruel . We have painstakingly perfected these dishes and as a result we have cultivated a very loyal following . We have also hired a female waitress who caters specifically to our lesbian guests who will never " mansplain " anything on the menu to them . Also , lesbians are never pressured or required to leave tips for our wait staff because we are aware it ' s against their religion . "
