My Uncle John , a Silver Star WWII veteran and the only member of my family I still spoke to , once said to me , " You ' re living the way we did during the Depression . " The only difference was my wife and I were living that way during a time of prosperity . John didn ' t say it like it was a bad thing on the contrary , he was proud of us . Like so many people who survived it , he remembered the Depression with nostalgia . Despite the poverty , in a lot of ways it was a better time than any he ' d lived through after , the times of greed when personal wealth became the end all and be all and the cause of so many conflicts in our family .
