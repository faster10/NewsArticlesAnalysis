" We worship thee , oh great Golden Mohammeden Statue , " said Raashid Amehejan , high priest of the " New Mosque of the Great Golden Representation Of Our Prophet " as he and his followers bowed in front of a statue of Ulysses S . Grant , which was fitted with a turban and a sign hung around its neck that read " Mohammed " . " You are our savior , oh Gilded One , and we give our undying devotion to your eternal brilliance not like those wack jobs that worship your unseen and formless spirit like a bunch of idiots . Pray for us , oh statue . "
