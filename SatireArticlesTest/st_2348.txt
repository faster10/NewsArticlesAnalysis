Was there really any doubt that crazed marijuana addicts would choose the house band of the pots indulged ? The Phish is a funk rocked , acid metal drug band that employs their own brand of confusing lyrics and out of leftfield musical progressions . One would expect The Phish to appeal to a mob of aimless dopers with low attention spans who are drug tripped to realms beyond normal understanding . Other bands in contention were spin off units , The Trey Pistachio Band , Mike Gordon ' s Headseed , and new comers , Umphrey ' s McGee , formed last year by drummer Jon Phishman .
