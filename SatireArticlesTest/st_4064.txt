So there you have it probably the main reason California is in the fiscal mess it ' s in . I miss the way we do it at home you get an idea , pay off a politician to write a bill , then pay off a bunch more to vote for it . It ' s quick and simple . Of course , New York is in no better fiscal shape than California , but at least we know why graft , corruption and lack of foresight . That ' s the American Way .
