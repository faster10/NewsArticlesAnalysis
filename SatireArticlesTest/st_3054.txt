Most of the Sigh , however , purposely lacks high style . The magic acts , animal shows and musical revues common to some casinos are eschewed in favor of public radio ' s " A Prairie Home Companion , " quietly piped in over the PA system . Instead of scantily clad cocktail waitresses , players serve themselves out of refrigerators located next to each gaming table , which are actually folding card tables covered with plastic , red and white checked tablecloths . One thing The Sigh hasn ' t skimped on is art . There are no neon pyramids or giant ice carvings , but the walls are lined with Norman Rockwell reprints bought at pediatrician office garage sales .
