It held a broken sarcophagus made of crystal glass , possibly damaged during the looting that took place during the political disturbances that ravaged Alexandria during the reign of Aurelian shortly after A . D . 270 . It also held 37 bones , mostly broken or heavily damaged , presumably all from the same adult male . A carbon dating analysis is already under way to determine the age of the bones , and a battery of other tests also await to determine if the bones could be those of the Macedonian king . Other than that , the site held only a small number of artefacts , mostly broken pottery , dating mostly from the Ptolemaic and Roman eras .
