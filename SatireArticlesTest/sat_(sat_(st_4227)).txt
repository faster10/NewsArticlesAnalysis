O ! Online contacted a practicing psychiatrist and expert on postpartum depression to discuss Cruise ' s latest incident . The psychiatrist remained anonymous indicating that it was ethically very " shady " to diagnose or make comments upon someone who had not been physically examined . " This is a classic case of the male equivalent of a postpartum depression with manic features . Given the time frame of the symptoms and their rapid onset , this appears to be an open and shut case . Postpartum depression in males is very poorly understood and frequently misdiagnosed as Bipolar Disorder . This diagnosis is not listed in the current DSM , but is scheduled to be included as a " provisional diagnosis warranting further investigation " in the upcoming DSM V , pending support for research from the pharmaceutical industry .
