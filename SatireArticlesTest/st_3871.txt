I was twenty seven years old and had been in some sort of business school busses , theatrical lighting , the club for ten straight years , ever since a month after I graduated from high school . I didn ' t know it yet , but soon I ' d be spending another year fighting the New York State Sales Tax Commission over one million dollars in taxes they said I owed them , like I ' d have gone out of business if I was making enough to owe a million dollars in taxes . I fought em alone , with no lawyers or accountants .
