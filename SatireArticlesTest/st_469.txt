" If somebody would ' ve told me that the election was today already , I might ' ve tried a little harder to come to a decision , " said Tim Rolands , an undecided from Vermont . " Instead , I get off from a hard day at work , where everyone was blabbering on and on about whatever shit they talk about , I get home after a long drive through unusually thick traffic , I turn on the TV , and I see CNN talking about my state being closed already . Wow , thanks for telling me , U . S . government . "
