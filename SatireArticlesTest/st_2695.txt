" Morons are what made this Republican Party great . Morons are the ones who honestly thought that rigging the tax code so that the super wealthy would get super wealthier would provide abundance for everyone , and not just result in money never leaving the One Percent , " Singer said , continuing to add , " Morons are the ones that think you can bomb your way to security , and that somehow magically we could have gotten a better deal with Iran on their nuclear program if only a hard line , hard nosed military hawk asshole had been leading the negotiations . Without the support of the kinds of morons who honestly think that you stop abortions by putting pregnant women and doctors in jail we can ' t win . So we just hope these morons keep finding spare change in their couch cushions and sending it to us morons will unite and take this country back from the elitist , education loving liberals , and that is undeniable fact .
