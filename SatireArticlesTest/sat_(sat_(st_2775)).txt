" As you all know , the only real way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun , or better yet an armed populace where everyone has at least six guns , " LaPierre told reporters outside the Fairfax , Virginia headquarters of the NRA , " but we at the NRA hear you loud and clear , and we can tell that you are making the mistake of wanting to do something about how easily people can get a gun in this country . " LaPierre said that it is " great , grave folly " to " do anything about our sacred , American God given right to own an implement of murder " but ultimately , he says he is not " made of stone " and he is willing to " crunch the numbers " to figure out just how many innocent victims should be buried six feet under the ground before gun laws are looked at more seriously as a solution to the problem of gun violence in America .
