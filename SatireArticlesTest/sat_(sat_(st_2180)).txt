According to Struthington , the timeline for implementing the height increase shortened after former Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling made erratic and racially insensitive remarks comparing his basketball team to a Southern plantation system . " The NBA didn ' t know if he had Alzheimer ' s or what he would blurt out next , so they got ahead of him before he spilled the beans about the whole thing . Sterling wanted the rim height upped years ago and was starting to get more vocal about it . He was a loose cannon . They had to get rid of him one way or another . "
