JC Franco , owner of Rite Greens in Denver , is offering six months of free marijuana to refugees while they adjust to life in the American west . " I can ' t image what they ' re going through , " says Franco , the 45 year old shop owner . " We hope some free weed will help them through the stress of everything and make them feel welcome . " Franco stated his shop will also help refugees sign up for government programs such as Obamacare , food stamp benefits , housing , and will help them through the process of obtaining a drivers license and registering to vote . " It ' s the least we can do , " Franco said , adding that his grandparents were Polish immigrants who fled Nazi Germany .
