Admitting that " there are few more talented people " than Bill Clinton , Barak Obama has already said that if elected he ' d give Mr Clinton a job " in a second " is the phrase I think he used . And who knows , maybe he would . Or , as I believe , he could just be blowing smoke in an attempt to co opt one of Hillary ' s major assets as President . He ' s assuring us , ' you can still get Bill without Hillary , so don ' t worry ' . Whether Mr Clinton would accept such a position is another issue entirely , but I doubt that even if he did , Bill and Barak would find themselves sitting together in bed at night discussing their next strategy for the Middle East , global warming or the economy .
