Anyway , America didn ' t care too much at the beginning of the Iraq invasion because we all saw some really cool video of stuff blowing up on TV it wasn ' t until our people started blowing up too that we began to take notice . But in our defense , we had other things to distract us our homes were increasing in value , seemingly exponentially , and we were really busy sorting through the offers from various banks to loan us money against them . So , in order to stop them from pestering us , we borrowed ( and borrowed and borrowed ) from the poor little dears . Kids I mean , what ' re you gonna do ? We changed the slogan from ' BUY AMERICAN ' to ' BUY , AMERICA ! ' and used all the money to buy crap from China . George Bush pointed proudly to the millions of jobs he created ( in Mexico , India , China and Vietnam ) with the support of venture capitalist companies with names like Bain ( Bane ? ) who compassionately thought Americans were working too hard and so shipped their jobs overseas to give them a break .
