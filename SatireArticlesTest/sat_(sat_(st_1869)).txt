Wallace wondered whether the Republican efforts could negatively affect Sanders ' s campaign . " Sanders has no PAC ( political action committee ) , and has emphasized that he doesn ' t want one . He is appealing not to the rich donors and therefore , is not beholden to them but to the general population . His donations now in the millions of dollars all came from small donors who gave an average of less than fifty dollars each . How do you fight that by bringing in lots of money to Sanders ? Will it make his campaign seemed unnaturally inflated and , therefore , destroy his message of being for the little guy ' ?
