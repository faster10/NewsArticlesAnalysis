Past errors committed under Bush include talking about the bewildering " two working families " , claiming that he has " been to war " , confusing the word " gracious " with " grateful " , saying that the " life of children living in the dark dungeons of the Internet " is important , saying that " families is where our nation finds hope , where wings take dream " , sympathizing with workers by saying " you ' re working hard to put food on your family , " claiming that " free nations do not develop weapons of mass destruction " , complimenting his wife on " doing a wonderful day " , asserting that except for Pearl Harbor and September 11th the U . S . has never been " hit " before , and starting the war in Iraq , among others .
