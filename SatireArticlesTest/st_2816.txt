The McRib was scheduled to have another limited 10 week run in select U . S . McDonald ' s restaurants later this month . The agreement that McDonald ' s came to with the World Health Organization will see the sandwich permanently removed from the menu in all locations worldwide . The cult favorite sandwich was previously under fire in 2011 when the Humane Society of the United States filed a complaint with the U . S . SEC against the meat producer , Smithfield Foods . The complaint alleged that the treatment of the animals used in the McRib was cruel and unusual .
