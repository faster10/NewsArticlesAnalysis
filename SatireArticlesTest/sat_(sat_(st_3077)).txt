Oh my god , the Arab Summer will be all about drab , drab , drab . Honestly . It ' ll be a total backlash against the crazy , sun filled , gun filled Arab Spring look . I really see the older generations stamping their influence on the Arab Summer . I see a lot of patient , unexciting sand colors . That whole shifting sands of time thing . Slow moving . More buttons , fewer zippers . And forget the running shoes . They ' ll go back in the closet next to the Jellies . Instead , the new footwear will be what I call Plod Wear . Every step will seem painfully slow . Like walking up a hill you thought you had already gone up .
