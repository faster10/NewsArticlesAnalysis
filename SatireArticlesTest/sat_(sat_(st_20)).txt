" The hard part is coming up with a lure . Its North Dakota . North Da kota . I live here and I still don ' t know what I do for fun . If Nevada wasn ' t a death penalty state I ' d do all my murdering there . You know hey you won a free trip to Vegas ! A night out with a few hookers . Maybe do a little coke . Make it look like a drug overdose . Man that would be easy . But Nevada has the death penalty , so . . . North Dakota it is . "
