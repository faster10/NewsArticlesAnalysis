The Webb campaign is hoping that his besting of Sanders in an arm wrestling match will prove Webb ' s superior prowess and maybe even garner him some votes from Republicans who are disgruntled about their choices in their own primary . " Clearly after watching me in the debate , " Webb told reporters , " you could tell that I ' d be a much happier Republican than a Democrat , so why not try and get some right wing votes . They like war , I like war . So maybe it ' s a match made in electoral heaven . "
