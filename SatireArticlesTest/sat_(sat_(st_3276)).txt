Still , I did give birth to 17 sweet baby episodes over four years . Not as many as I ' d hoped , I ' ll admit it , but what can I say I have high standards . I did not want to go on air with shows that weren ' t loaded with insightful personal reflections and my uncannily prescient take on current events . It may have been me providing the comedy and commentary , but I know you were there all the way . Cheering me on during every hilarious voice I performed , every spot on impression .
