" In medical school we learn about a certain medication that is only to be used when the patient is in so much pain without any known reason . I am required to do a full workup with CT scans , MRI and when nothing is found and trust me we couldn ' t find anything you call pharmacy for the good stuff . " ' Dr Zimban went on to clarify . " This condition of 11 10 pain is not like my burn victims who were hit by a rolled over , open top knife truck , who are in 10 10 pain . No , they look like you and me , talk like you and me , are able to eat and talk on their cell phones like you and me . They just need a certain medication that we doctors withhold from everyone that has 10 10 pain or below . "
