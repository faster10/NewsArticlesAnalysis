" If he just plumb forgot , then I ' ll have to keep a close eye on him , " noted Fred Gremley , CEO of National Fidelity Financial , where Stratton works . " Forgettin ' what you had for dinner last night is one thing , but this if he can ' t recall having just tied one off , he ' s liable to forget how to get to work , how to use the phone , or where he put the latest liability contract . Either that or he ' s a darn filthy liar , which is grounds for bein ' booted as well , if I may be so bold . "
