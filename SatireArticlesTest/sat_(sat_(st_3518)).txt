Kevin Carstens , Moderator of Sickbuildings , a 1 , 700 member support group of average citizens , who , according to the ACAAI and AAAAI , are experiencing " presumed " debilitating mold illnesses said , " The CDC keeps saying more studies are needed to get a clear picture of the health effects related to mycotoxins . I am not aware of any new CDC initiated studies of the matter or even any tracking of these illnesses . Nor have I seen any warning to the public regarding the potential serious health effects of inhaling mycotoxins . I guess the burden of proof will fall on the children of New Orleans . "
