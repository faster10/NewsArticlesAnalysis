" The NRA strongly advises against Americans discussing gun control at this time , " said Jack Levi , the NRA ' s Assistant Deputy Press Relations Chief . Levi said that " letting emotions take over a highly emotional event " will only lead to " the further eroding of our Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms . " Mr Levi said that " despite gun sales skyrocketing in the last few years , and despite the fact that the majority of the gun laws passed in this country have been to open up more places to legally carry a gun " that the Obama administration and the liberal media have " created a sense of urgency " when it ' s not necessary .
