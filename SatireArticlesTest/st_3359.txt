President Obama has raised the question in campaign speeches recently , asking whether it ' s a good thing or not that shadowy foreign governments and corporations can now contribute buckets of cash to our politicians without any public accountability ( Actually , I think he said it wasn ' t a good thing ) . Well , Mr President , Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas thought it was a good idea and since his wife actually solicits those donations from those shadowy foreign governments and corporations on behalf of Conservative PACs , he ' s in a position to know about the issue intimately and if you can ' t trust Clarence Thomas , who can you trust ?
