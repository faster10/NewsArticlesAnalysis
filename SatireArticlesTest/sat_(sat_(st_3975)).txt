Assuming we get that biggie above , I ' m starting to examine Paris ' life to prove that she leads a Christian one . That ' s a hanging curve ball . Everyone who has a high speed internet connection knows Paris was looser than the teeth of an Arkansas trailer park denizen above the age of 45 . And now she ' s going to Rwanda . She said her previous life made her " feel empty " and she wants to leave " a mark , more than the ones from stiletto heels during a really rocking bondage season . "
