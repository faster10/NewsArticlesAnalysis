AP : Well , as you know I was Secretary of the Veterans Administration from 2001 to 2004 . Having such a high ranking position has its perks . For one , I was able to procure contracts with the VA for my company . Steering 1 . 2 billion worth of contracts to my company was very easy . And of course , all of the VA employees who went along with this got handsome rewards as well . Who ever said get rich quick schemes don ' t really work ? Hahaha !
