" It ' s a perfect storm . Kids these days are leaving Facebook in droves for social media opportunities that can ' t be monitored by their parents . They want anonymity which the grainy low bit Razr camera provides . They wanna share music and videos that can ' t be viewed by someone looking over their shoulder , which makes the tiny screen perfect . They wanna wear skinny jeans ( which god only knows why , cause tapered legs is a terrible look ) , but they ' re gonna need a phone that can fit in those stupid pockets . Lastly , why spend millions of dollars chasing the nest new thing when you can go retro ? Retro is always in style . . . always . "
