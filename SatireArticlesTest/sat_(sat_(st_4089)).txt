James L . McGaugh , a neurobiologist at U . C . Irvine whose study of stress hormones and memory consolidation in rats is one of the cornerstones of the conscience suppression research , acknowledges the ambiguities but comes out swinging in defense of his work . " Is it immoral to weaken the memory of horrendous acts a person has committed ? It doesn ' t surprise me at all that politicians would wake up screaming , thinking of the young children they destroyed , " McGaugh says . " But is treating that worse than saying , ' Don ' t worry if your constituents hate you , we ' ve got a huge war chest and voter software to prevent you from getting kicked out of office ' ? Why is it any worse to give them a drug that prevents them from having PSTD for the rest of their lives ? The moral dilemma is sending corporate whores to represent the interests of poor people in the first place . "
