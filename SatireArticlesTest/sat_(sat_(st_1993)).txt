" I ' m just really looking forward to doing nothing in a new setting , away from politics , " Boehner told the reporter , adding that " it ' s one thing to collect a paycheck for doing nothing from the taxpayers while ironically decrying those who take government assistance when they are jobless or need help feeding their kids but I really want to explore what it ' s like doing nothing in the private sector as well . " While Boehner said he ' s open to the idea of becoming a lobbyist so he could return to D . C . , he ' d only do so if he could " continue his long held tradition of taking money for not doing work . "
