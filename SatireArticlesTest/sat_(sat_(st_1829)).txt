ORLANDO , FL In a stunning announcement videotaped during a March 8 Orlando Sentinel interview but only made public March 24 , neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman vowed to help put America back on the right path to freedom by " putting myself in any position to help another human in any way I can , " adding his name to the short list of GOP candidates spearheaded by Texas Senator Ted Cruz . " This blows the announcement from Cruz right out of the water , " remarked a Zimmerman advisor .
