Financial advisors insist that you need to beat the inflation rate by investing . Just like DVT prophylaxis , it ' s hogwash ! Stick with cash because who doesn ' t love cash ? Or if you really want to make some gains , put it all into a savings account ( a regular one , not those high yield savings accounts ) . With an average interest rate of 0 . 06 , do you know how much money that ' ll rake in after a few decades ? CHA CHING ! ! ! ! Now you can buy your own home Da Vinci robot !
