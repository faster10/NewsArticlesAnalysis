For some Republicans in Wisconsin , however , restricting the food choices of the poor and forcing them to take drug tests on the presumption that poor people are more likely to abuse drugs , despite there being no actual evidence of this being the case doesn ' t go far enough . Thompaulsen says , " we ' re going to advance a bill in the coming weeks that also forces poor people to wear big red ' P ' letters on their chests , and expressly forbids them from smiling or ' showing any kind of enthusiasm or joy ' while getting welfare . " The Shut Up and Look Sad Like the Poor You Are Act of 2015 would force all Wisconsinites on public assistance to " appear disheveled " and " dirty " at all times , and to " stop acting all alive and stuff " when someone who is not on welfare sees them .
