I could go over hundreds of instances of God based slaughter Hindus , Muslims , Jews , Aztecs , Mayans , probably Zoroastrians too , but quite frankly , it ' s just too depressing . Religion is just too depressing well the people who use it to commit violence or oppress others are . Which are in the case of the " Ground Zero Mosque " , the ones who are trying to stop it from being built . The Muslims that are trying to build are just wrong .
