" You ' ve got a complaint from the neighbor . " , he says . I tell him the story . He silently stares at the RV for a bit it really looks pretty , all washed and shiny . Finally he says , " I wish I had something that looked as ' terrible ' as that . " He apologizes for bothering me and leaves . With the quiet satisfaction of knowing that an obnoxious old woman with a superiority complex is fuming next door , I start thinking that maybe I ' ll keep doing this taking it out for a night and bringing it back for three days again for the next month until we move , just to drive her crazy .
