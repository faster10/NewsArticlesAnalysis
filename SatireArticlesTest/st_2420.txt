" If you wanna go start your own country somewhere where you can be all flowery and lovey dovey , that ' s on you , " Bauer said , " but clearly this great nation was built on the idea that white people are just you know that much better than non whites .

If that makes us racist , then well , I don ' t know what to say , really . "
