Reverend Messiah also seems to think , and bear with me here as some of what he says is kinda true , that " Radical Clerics are turbine wearing morons " . Now , forget the fact that anyone who puts a turbine on top of their heads and try to talk about religion would indeed be a moron after all , some turbines are huge and really can hurt . What Scratch Messiah obviously meant to say was that Radical Clerics wear turbans , not turbines . I know that , even if the Reverend Messiah doesn ' t . See , see ? I ' m not uneducated , so there .
