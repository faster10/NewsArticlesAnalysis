Newly sworn in Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has said that a United States attack on Iran is " simply not in the cards . " Ms . Rice , speaking after talks with British Prime Minister Tony Blair was able to prove her assertion by actually showing the assembled reporters a deck of cards she was holding saying , " Look , go ahead and look . There ' s a Jack of Hearts , here ' s an Ace of Spades fifty two cards plus two jokers and not one of them says anything about attacking Iran . " The gathered correspondents were unimpressed , saying that there was no way a lowly secretary would know everything her boss was planning .
