Several key observations swayed IDSA committee members to make the historic about face in their stance on handwashing : If water is so great , why do we have conditions like hot tub lung due to Mycobacterium avium complex or Pseudomonas hot foot syndrome ? If soap is so great , why do people who wash daily still get MRSA boils ? If the combination of water and soap is so mind blowing , then why does bacteria form that nasty slime at the base of porcelain sinks and tubs ? Is washing one ' s hands over and over again worth all the skin chafing ?
