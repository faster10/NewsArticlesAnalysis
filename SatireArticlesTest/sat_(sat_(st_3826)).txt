This of course has nothing to do with the rest of the article I just remembered it and wanted to jot it down before it drifted away again for another couple decades . That happens to me a lot . What I do want to do is compare and contrast two other worlds , California and New York . This is a political site and both states have politics in them , so it ' s a good fit . Both states also have gubernatorial elections this year and kinda weirdly , the Attorney Generals ( Ahem , excuse me Attorneys General or is Attornies ? ) from both states ( Andrew Cuomo in NY and Jerry Brown in CA ) are running as Democrats and rich business people with no political experience are running as Republicans ( Carl Paladino in NY and Meg Whitman in CA )
