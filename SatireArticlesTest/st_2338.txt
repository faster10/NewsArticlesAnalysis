" The Christie staffer said while his boss didn ' t enjoy any bump in the polls from his debate performance , he wasn ' t that worried . " Governor Christie is just here for the free plane trips , food , limo rides , and security , " the aide said , " and nothing proves his fiscal responsibility like taking millions of dollars from donors and not giving them any return on their investment .
