Robinson claims to have come dangerously close to missing his chance to go nowhere . As a wide receiver on Sheboygan high school ' s football squad , he almost chose a partial scholarship to the University of Wisconsin over the position at the factory that was being vacated by his father , Hank Robinson , whose uncontrollable alcoholism got him fired in ' 78 , thus necessitating the junior Robinson to become the family ' s breadwinner . Other close calls like opting to give up beer after a crazy night in ' 80 , the closing of Homer ' s Pub in ' 82 , and a critically acclaimed performance in the Sheboygan Community Theater ' s production of " Goldfinger " in which he portrayed " Odd Job " with stunning stoicism and vacancy nearly derailed his career as A lister at Community Dart Night .
