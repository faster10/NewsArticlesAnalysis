Last week a person by the name of Spoiler Man went on a Star Wars : The Force Awakens leak rampage ! According to his leaks , there will be no Boba Fett , no Darth Revan and at least no Jar Jar Binks or Ewoks . " The film is dystopian and darker than Empire . Some 30 40 years have passed since Return of the Jedi , and the Empire and New Republic have been locked in a war of attrition . Everyone is languishing and sick of the war . The script , which is described as " too good for JJ Abrams " , begins in space , above a desert planet presumably Tatooine . " This is according to one of his posts on 4Chan .
