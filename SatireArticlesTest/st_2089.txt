" We have a week long training program , " said factory manager Lane Duffield , " but without a lick of training , Mr Bachmann packed that fudge like nobody ' s business . You ' d have thought he ' d been packing fudge for years ! I asked him Are you sure you ' ve never done this before , Mr Bachmann ? ' and he said ' Heavens , no ! ' but if you ask me , I think he definitely packed fudge before this . "
