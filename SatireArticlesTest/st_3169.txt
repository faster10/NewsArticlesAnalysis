The death of interview subjects like Kantz was a constant irritant to researchers , said lead investigator Prof . Nicholas Joyce . To offset this , his team also spoke with surviving passengers of auto accidents in which the driver died instantly during head on collisions . Eyewitnesses were asked what the drivers ' last words were moments before impact when each driver had , in that sense , reached his or her destination and could share their impression of it . In 68 percent of accidents , Joyce said , the driver ' s final observation was reported to be , " Oh shit . "
