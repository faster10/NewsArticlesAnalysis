Another dean , wishing to remain anonymous , had this to say : " I don ' t wish to sound alarmist , but we can ' t hide the reality that the entire future of patient care is at stake . If doctors don ' t know coding , they can ' t document , and according to CMS if it ' s not documented it ' s not done . " ' We simply cannot risk arteries re thrombosing , cured cancers recurring , kidney stones re obstructing or newborns re entering the womb . What kind of medical care would that be ?
