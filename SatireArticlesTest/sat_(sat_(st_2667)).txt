Steve Fairy , a younger member of Davis ' regular crowd , says he still has 60 days to wear his man bun before the law goes into effect . " It ' s not a style thing , it just keeps my hair out of the way . Everyone says ' Why don ' t you just cut your hair shorter ? ' Well , dammit I don ' t want to cut my hair shorter , and nobody can make me cut my hair shorter not you , not the government , not even Obama . First they take my bun , next they take my gun , which is what he ' s doing anyway . "
