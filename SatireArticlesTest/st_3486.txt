Now , I do take issue with a couple of things the Reverend Scratch Messiah said here . First and foremost , I must dispute Messiah ' s allegation that my article is an example of " Liberal , self proclaimed know it all , uneducated rhetoric . " While I do not dispute the fact that I am a Liberal self proclaimed know it all , I have to say that I spew out Educated rhetoric . That stings , being called uneducated , especially by a guy who thinks Pat Robertson is a good man . It ' s a real pot calling the kettle black syndrome , at least to this know it all .
