Uh , oh . Produce is next to Deli and Deli Girl ! Maybe , if I make a circuit around the front of the store , past Checkout , I can come to the carrots without Deli Girl seeing me . I edge past the people on the checkout lines ( catching a few carts in the shins from the women who were in the fight in the parking lot it ' s funny how they put aside their differences in the face of a common enemy me ) and , move at a military crouch towards Produce . About ten feet from my objective I kneel down like I ' m tying my shoe and sort of scoot slide along the floor until I ' m just below the carrots . I glance over the top of the center aisle display , my eyes just level with the rutabaga There ' s no sign of the enemy . I grab a bunch of carrots and straightening , turn to retrace my steps .
