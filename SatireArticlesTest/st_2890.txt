Unlike the Wall Street Journal , its in town rival , The New York Times has shunned charging a subscription , and has no plans to change that , said Times spokesman Adelle Friedman . Instead , the entire Times site will be " vertically recalibrated " as " Premium Content , " and be publicly available for only 29 . 95 a month . " Aside from the Journal , the subscription model on the Internet does not work , " said Friedman . " Therefore , this is not a subscription model . "
