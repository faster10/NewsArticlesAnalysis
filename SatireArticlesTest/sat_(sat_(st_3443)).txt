It was revealed today that the Vice President ' s decision to out Mrs Wilson ( Plame ) resulted directly in the deaths of two undercover operatives in the middle east who were linked to her undercover corporate position . Lawyers for the White House maintain that the Vice President was all along unaware of Plame ' s deep cover status , and shouldn ' t be held accountable for the deaths . This development elevates the Vice President ' s act to one of treason , which may be punishable by execution .
