Instead , they ' ll saddle this country with a debt load that your great grandchildren will still be struggling to pay off . Instead of federal income tax , they ' ll cut funding to the individual states who ' ll have to cut funding to the individual counties , who ' ll cut money to the towns , who have to make up the shortfall somehow . Usually that means increases in property taxes and decreases in local services . In New York State where I live , Governor George Pataki , who has aspirations of running for president himself , has even proposed letting local governments tax our trees to help make up the difference . Tax the trees . Tax the trees . Amazing . The only way for large lot and rural homeowners to keep their property taxes down will be to strip those properties bare of any large , valuable trees . When Mr Pataki comes to your state and brings up his love for the environment , please mention this one .
