" We winnow down the same way our competitors do GPA , test scores , extracurriculars , " Kanali explains . " Of course , being Yale , we ' re still left with thousands of impressive applicants , so our secret is , we make the final cut based on the student essay . Over the three days before we announce , we have our admissions officers read the final candidates ' essays aloud , one at a time . While one officer reads , the rest of us wear clown masks and shock the reader with defibrillators . We base our decisions solely on whether the reader is able to finish the essay . Usually they can ' t , so most applicants are rejected . That ' s why we only admit about 8 percent of applicants .
