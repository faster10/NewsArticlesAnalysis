" He told me that he was always taught that to die as a martyr would open him the Gates of Jannah , or Gates of Heaven " recalled the priest . " Yet , as he had started to ascend towards the light of the Heavens , devilish entities , or Jinns he called them , appeared and led him to the fiery pits of Hell . There he had to relive all the pain he had inflicted upon others and every death he had caused throughout his entire life . He even had to relive the decapitations of his victims through their own eyes " , images the jihadist claims will haunt him for the rest of his life , admits the priest .
