Elizabeth Halsey , step mother to a transgender graduate of Appleton High , is also in favor of body cameras , saying her son had been relentlessly bullied in school and had no way to prove it to school officials . " Body cams are a great idea . Schools should be a safe space for all , " Mrs Halsey added , " not everyone is built like Hulk Hogan and can defend themselves in a fist fight . This Macho Camacho mentality that kids are being taught is dangerous . Nobody is born a bully , kids learn this behavior from their parents . "
