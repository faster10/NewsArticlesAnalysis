" I ' m not a heartless sociopath , I can be flexible , " Jasper told our reporter , adding that the alleged rape or incest victim just " needs to prove that she wasn ' t dressed provocatively " and that " she didn ' t do or say things to in any way , shape , or form imply that she ' d be willing to have sex with her rapist . " Jasper said he isn ' t " victim blaming " so much as " making sure any alleged victim takes her share of the credit for being in a situation to be raped in the first place . " Usually , Jasper says , what the woman did to be put in the situation to be raped is " being a woman . "
