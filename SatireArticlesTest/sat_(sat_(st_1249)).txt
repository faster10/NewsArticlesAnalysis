" Yeah , patients sometimes do this , " said Torres ' internist Dr Chris Wardenski . " They get this thought in their head like ' Oooo , I ' m going to do it the old fashioned way and change my life ' and then they show up six months later , frequently still smoking and usually even more obese . And then they ask me for an anti depressant to deal with their failures . It ' s just gross . So these days I usually try and start the meds right away and save the disappointment . "
