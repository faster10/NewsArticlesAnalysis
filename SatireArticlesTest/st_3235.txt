As part of its staff cuts , online auction site eBay says it will auction its employees off individually . To increase interest , eBay pairs each outgoing staffer with a fine collectible . On day one , bidding on human resources manager Claudia Penton with a set of Mr Peanut snack cups is slow , but the action on marketing director Randy Keller with a hand painted Limoges sardine server is quite hectic . Explains Keller : " I think it ' s obvious why my bids are moving . I have six years experience in product positioning and demand planning , and come with a matching server tray . "
