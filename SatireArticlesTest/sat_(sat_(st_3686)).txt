By the same token , there should be no churches or synagogues built either , and not just near Ground Zero . Anywhere . I don ' t care if people want to believe in a creator of some sort , or saints or miracles or floods and pillars of salt or laying on of hands or the healing power of Kinoki Foot Pads . We all have fantasies they ' re fun and nice and make us feel good sometimes when life gets us down . It ' s just that we tend to go overboard and let those fantasies get outta hand . We start believing them to the point where not only are we convinced they ' re true , but that everyone else who doesn ' t share our beliefs is not just wrong , but that they ' re also gonna suffer eternal hell fire because of it . Worse , we believe that since they don ' t share our fantasies , it ' s not only okay to kill them , it ' s necessary .
