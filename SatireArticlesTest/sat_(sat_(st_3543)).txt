( Washington , D . C . ) The televised live bipartisan debate between President Obama and members of Congress was generally dubbed a " publicity stunt " by the media as well as political scholars , who are convinced that neither side was swayed . " Only the infirm or unemployed could have possibly sat home and watched it all , " said Douglas Brinkley , a professor Rice University . " Pugnacious White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel immediately fired back at Brinkley . " Based on current unemployment records and those denied health care due to preexisting conditions , we estimate that more Americans were able to watch this discussion than the final episode of " Friends " . That ' s what I call getting word out . I don ' t know what the egghead calls it . "
