" I ' m disappointed at the turnout , " said Dugan . " I guess the high price of gas caused the members of ' Follow the Leader ' to stay home . Too bad . Even though the turnout was somewhat disappointing , I know that our members , out there somewhere , are supporting our great president , George W . Bush , who will undoubtedly go down in history with Lincoln and Washington ! I ' m sure , " observed Dugan , " that Those crazy liberal and cowardly organizations who have bad things to say about Bush , Cheney , Gonzalez and others of our fine statesmen will be drowned out by the overwhelming influence of our organization , ' Follow the Leader ' , as our heroic Christian soldiers kill and maim to bring Democracy to the ragheads .
