" One of histories most puzzling maps is that of the Turkish admiral Piri Reis in 1513 AD which successfully mapped the coastline of Antarctica over 500 years ago . What is most fascinating about this map is that it shows the coastline of Antarctica without any ice . How is this possible when images of the subglacial coastline of Antarctica were only seen for the first time after the development of ground penetrating radar in 1958 ? Is it possible Antarctica has not always been covered under such an ice sheet ? This could be evidence that it is a possibility " he acknowledges .
