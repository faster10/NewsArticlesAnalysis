" Undoubtedly , " Santorum told the press , " the thought of getting to be the closest person to God is appealing . Surely I would relish the opportunity to nakedly use scripture and holy texts to base my actions and policies on , instead of hiding it behind rhetoric meant to mask my religious fundamentalism . " He paused for a moment , " Not having to even bother with the stupid First Amendment is definitely appealing too , " Santorum said , but then after a moment , " However , I made a promise to myself to not stop until I was sure that I couldn ' t get another single campaign contribution , and believe it or not , there are still people silly enough to think I have a chance at becoming president one day . So maybe I ' ll run for pope , maybe I won ' t , but one thing I am absolutely committed to doing with all my heart is collecting campaign contributions . God Bless America , God Bless God , God Bless the Pope , and most importantly , God Bless me . Santorum : OUT ! "
