" I ' m not sure what I ' ll do next , " Priebus told the media , " I kind of want my money back , but now I ' m not sure anyone can polish my turds enough for my standards . And if I don ' t get the American people to buy at least one of these turds from me , then I might be out as the Republican ' s Chief Turd Seller , and I can ' t live my life with that kind of failure . " Priebus said that it ' s still not too late for him to find another turd to add to the collection , in the hopes that new turd will be the turd that " shines up to perfection , " but that he " isn ' t holding his breath .
