November 2nd won ' t be the end of the world for Democrats it may not even be end of the world for the GOP . Sharon Angle may oust Harry Reid , which puts moderate women Nevada Republicans in the position of not being able to bring themselves to endorse Reid , but outspoken in their anti Angle pronouncements . While every vote counts , I was never that enamored of Reid either , I don ' t know much about Nevada politics , but you ' d think a state where the vast majority of the people live the Las Vegas area would be a bit more progressive than Sharon Angle . Hell , that albino priest in the Da Vinci Code was more moderate than Sharon Angle .
