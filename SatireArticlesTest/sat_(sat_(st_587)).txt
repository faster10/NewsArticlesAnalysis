" He just never learned that college actually ends , " said Stills . " I mean , who doesn ' t wish we could go back and have all those , I ' m too high to go to class ' days , or times when you could convince your friends to copy their own homework , put your name on it and turn it in ? Life goes on , man , and while he lives in Chicago he ' s lamenting the fact that no one in this shitty town recognizes him ? Sick . "
