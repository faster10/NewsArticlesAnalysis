Chuck is a supporter of Wisconsin Governor and Tea party grass roots presidential candidate Scott Walker . He and his friends were having an unofficial NRA gathering to discuss legal second amendment weaponry necessary to the security of a free State as pertaining to the upcoming deer hunting season this Fall . Other topics of their barbecue discussions were politics , especially the damage to society resulting from liberal agenda items like Obamacare , illegal immigration , and marriage between homogays . All of this over a few beers and grilled animal carcasses made for what Chuck thought was a perfectly innocent and free exercise of his rights under law .
