We help them avoid a predatory life of killing to feed themselves , their chances to reincarnate into a higher being , or maybe even a human being , are infinitely multiplied , " admits Bin Nay Tran , a leading monk at the monastery . " Is the jungle life , filled with the necessity of pursuing and killing other animals a good life ? " he asks . " Here they are fed and need not to hunt and prey on other living beings . They can meditate on the meaning of life and transcend their earthly condition , " he told local reporters . " If they live shorter lives , but they live happy lives , is not that which is important ? " he adds .
