We ' ve had other presidents that people disagreed with like Ulysses S . Grant and Calvin Coolidge , but the nation survived , didn ' t it ? Bush is a strong leader and Americans love strong leaders . So what if he risks our values , our liberty and our future ? Americans love to gamble it pits us against the universe . So to all the critics , why wait for the Rapture when we have Bush in the White House ? Sit back and enjoy the ride . There ' s only three more years to go and , by that time , Karl Rove will find us a new president .
