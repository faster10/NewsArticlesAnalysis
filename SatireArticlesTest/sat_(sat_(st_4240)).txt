A short time later the PA comes in . " Hello , Mr Terzella , and how are we today ? It says here on the chart that we have a sore throat . " " You too ? " , I ask . " I guess it ' s going around , huh ? And why is your medical information on my chart ? " She stares at me . Hard . " Open you mouth and say ahhh . " I do so and she jabs a piece of wood into my tongue . " Owww ! " , I say . " No , ahhh . " " Owww ! ' " That ' s right , ahhh . Oh my , your throat must be very sore . It ' s all red and inflamed . " " I already knew that ! " " Oh , are you a doctor ? " " No , we ' ve covered that . What wrong with my throat ? " " I just told you , it ' s all red and inflamed and sore . You have a sore throat . "
