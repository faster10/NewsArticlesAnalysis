Howard Dean , when reached by phone and asked about the potential for the Clinton Bush team , responded politely . " I really think that could be a fascinating possibility . I ' d vote for a team like that . It might stop the bickering associated with Washington these days . But I don ' t think my opinion matters , really . I ' m just an accountant for an office supple store . I ' m not the Howard Dean you ' re looking for . "
