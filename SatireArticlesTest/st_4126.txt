Rancho Santa Fe businessman Robert Herring has offered Michael Schiavo one million dollars if he ' ll sell his wife Terri , correctly assuming that anyone who ' s fought for years to end his wife ' s suffering must be just another money grubbing Heathen slime who ' s only ever really been out for the cash . Herring , who has never actually seen Ms . Schiavo but whose extensive medical background has included reading lots and lots of articles in such diverse and august publications as People and The Enquirer as well as watching hours and hours of Fox News coverage , agrees with Ms . Schiavo ' s parents that Teri , who has been in a constant vegetative state for fifteen years , is sure to improve with treatment and therapy which she apparently has not been receiving for the past decade and a half .
