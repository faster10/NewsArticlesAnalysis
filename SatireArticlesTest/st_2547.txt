" Senator Graham is distraught over the disappearance of his purse , " says DC Metro Detective Benjamin Demova , who was assigned to the case . " The Senator says he will not pursue charges , so long as the purse is returned to him in a timely fashion . There ' s a chance that this was all just a misunderstanding , and that perhaps the woman in the surveillance video thought she was grabbing her own purse . But we won ' t know if she doesn ' t come forward . "
