Three time Sterile Gown winner Jamie Mathers won again with an absolute blowout of the competition . " I practically live on C . diff alley and sometimes I have 4 , 5 , or even 6 patients . We are under staffed and I have to put these gowns on fast , properly , and then dispose of them , " she boasted with 21 seconds separating her and the 2nd place finisher . " I hope next year they make us wash our hands because these boys and girls don ' t even know how much longer that can add to your time if you are out of practice . "
