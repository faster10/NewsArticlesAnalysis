" The media has been disgusting , " Trump continued . " The hotels I own , those are nice , okay ? My golf courses , my casinos , those are nice places , very classy . My daughter Ivanka , she ' s nice . She has the nicest legs I ' ve ever seen , very lovely , very nice . I could stare at her legs all day . But there ' s nothing nice about a terrorist attack . There ' s nothing nice about people dead in the streets of France . "
