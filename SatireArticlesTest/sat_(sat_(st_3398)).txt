The enlistment of doctors in the service of the torture of prisoners is hauntingly reminiscent of the work of Dr Josef Mengele , the Nazis ' " Angel of Death " at Auschwitz . In that case , instead of receiving one lump sum , plaintiffs received malpractice payments over time , and non economic damages and legal fees were capped at 250 , 000 . the Bush administration claims that , if meaningful tort reform applied the same standards today , psychiatrists at Guantanamo would pay less than 10 , 000 this year in malpractice premiums , their Abu Ghraib colleagues less than 9 , 600 . Dr Strange , a former Navy psychiatrist for the Fleet Hospital , said that premiums for his three doctor interrogation group jumped on Jan . 1 from 47 , 000 to 75 , 000 . As a result , he said , the Navy has put off hiring new staff , even though it recently opened a new camp . Other groups at the prison are deferring equipment purchases .
