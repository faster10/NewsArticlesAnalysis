And that ' s the first part of a two fold problem supposedly smart , multi billion dollar corporations should be able to figure out ways to protect themselves , but don ' t always do it . The second part is that , given the nature of our governmental system , our leadership , and therefore it ' s agendas , change every four or eight years . Even if it starts out under one president as a benign tool to protect us , what ' s to stop the next guy from using it as weapon against his own internal political enemies ? As a Liberal , I ' d let Obama do it , but be terrified if Dick Cheney was in charge . Conservatives should feel the same way , with only the names reversed .
