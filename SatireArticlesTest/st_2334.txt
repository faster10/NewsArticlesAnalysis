" I ' ve been there , " said Deen . " It ' s no fun when you ' re the turd in the punchbowl . There ' s just no other way to put it , y ' all . That ' s what I felt like . I felt like a big ole smelly turd , just floatin ' around , tryin ' to get out , splashin ' and kickin ' , everybody just lookin ' and pointin ' , holdin ' their nose , and nobody comin ' to help fish me out .
