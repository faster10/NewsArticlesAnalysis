" Y ' know , I ' ve been working my butt off since high school and I ' m approaching 30 , " said an anonymous medical resident . " I understand that less than 10 an hour is not enough to live on , but I ' ve been making it work for over a decade now . I ' m a quarter million in debt with no credit to my name , and I make well less than 8 an hour right now . We could demand high salaries , sure , but if money was the problem , I would have pursued a different career . And that ' s the quarter pound of truth . Ba da ba ba ba . "
