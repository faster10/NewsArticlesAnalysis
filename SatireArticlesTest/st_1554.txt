KutcherKunis has surpassed the popularity once held by Brangelina . " Ashton and Mila are the couple that people want to know , " said celebrity trend spotter Rona Bartlett . " They ' re young , they ' re hip , they ' ve got everything and they ' re happy ! Brad and Angie of course have all those kids , but they ' ve grown out of that " cute " stage , and they always seemed to be so grown up for children , " added Bartlett . " The ' cute ' factor is very important to Hollywood stars and to the public in terms of brand , " said Bartlett " Just look at Gwyneth Paltrow ! "
