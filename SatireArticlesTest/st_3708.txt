A Senior White House Aide who was on loan to the Administration from the Oil Industry has abruptly resigned to " spend more time with his family " after it was revealed that he edited a major report on the effects of global warming and greenhouse gasses . Instead of allowing the report , which blamed the rampant use of fossil fuels for the depletion of the atmospheric ozone layer and the rise of greenhouse gasses , to remain as is , Phillip Cooney instead altered the report to blame actual garden greenhouses around the country for the ruin of the environment , particularly blaming organic greenhouse growers . The revelation of the changes has caused another black eye for the Administration . Vice President Dick ( Dick ) Cheney has responded to the resignation , saying that Howard Dean , while over the top , would have probably made a much better President than George W . Bush . Of course , Mr Cheney also acknowledged , a small brown stain would have probably made a much better President than George W . Bush .
