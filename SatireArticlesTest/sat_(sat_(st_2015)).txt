To facilitate the sale and trade of slaves , Mosby says Kentucky would set up a monthly " slave auction , " to be held on the first Monday of every month . At these auctions , private citizens could offer themselves up as slaves , and slave owners could offer their own slaves for sale or trade . Any sales or trades that occur outside of the sanctioned buildings would be considered illegal transactions . Buyers and sellers must be recognized as legal residents of the State of Kentucky interstate and international trades and sales would be prohibited .
