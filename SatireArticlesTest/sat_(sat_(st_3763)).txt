Now , Mom and Dad , I ' ve been thinking about what comes next for me . I got some money put away , so I don ' t have to worry about getting a job so much right away , but I don ' t just wanna go out and build houses and stuff for poor people like Jimmy Carter does , or do international stuff like Bill Clinton I was never too good at understanding funny accents . But a couple of the guys and me think we can make a real go an investment thing we thought up . I don ' t wanna give away too much now cause you might jinx it for me , but it ' ll be me , one of King Abdullah ' s kids , the one with the lazy eye , and some other guys . I was hoping you could talk to some of your friends , Dad , and see if they could put up some seed money , just billion or so . We could really make a killing , really . I ' ll make you proud , I promise .
