In another moment forever ingrained in my memory , I listened as he said , " Kay , all these people know who I am . I take them to school everyday . I took their parents to school , " he laughed a bit , " I probably took some of their grandparents to school . They know me , they know my car , they know what I ' ve done and what I stand for . I ' m certainly not going to shoot one of them and if one of them wants to kill me , then I ' m not the man I always thought I was . "
