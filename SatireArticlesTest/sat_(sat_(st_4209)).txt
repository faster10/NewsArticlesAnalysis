In a minority opinion , Justice Sandra Day O ' Connor claimed the decision hurt small property owners and gave a " disproportionate influence " in the political process to large corporations and developers . The Fifth Amendment requires that " just compensation " be paid when local and state governments use eminent domain and that the property must be for " public use . " In the past , eminent domain has been used to build bridges and highways , and for slum clearance and redevelopment , but the conservative Court ' s decision widened the concept of " public use " to include " public purpose " to create jobs or increase economic activity .
