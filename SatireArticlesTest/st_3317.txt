One evening not long ago my wife and I found ourselves bound for our local shopping mall . She had to buy stuff , you see . Now , don ' t get me wrong . Neither my wife nor I are really shoppers , so I don ' t want to imply that she was out there just mindlessly spending money , especially since she ' ll probably read this and if I make her look bad I ' ll catch it hot big time . By the way , have I told you how beautiful , intelligent and charming my wife is ? No ? Well , I would right now but this is only a thousand word essay and quite frankly , a thousand words just wouldn ' t be enough to cover it all . ( How was that , honey ? )
