It ' s a slightly schizophrenic movement , this " Tea Party " . Taking over Chrysler and saving a couple million jobs was a bad idea , providing affordable healthcare to 40 or 50 million Americans is a step towards Socialism Communism Fascism take your pick . Saving a single stem cell is more important than saving the lives of potentially millions of people that the cure using the research on that stem cell may produce . Carrying weapons into Starbucks ( and yes , I ' m a gun owner who holds a pistol permit ) and scaring people is a way to show you ' re a law abiding citizen . Driving in a Caravan around the country instead of working ( or looking for work ) is another a good way to show how concerned you are about the economy . Even using the name " Tea Party " , which was about American ' s right to be taxed by their own elected government ( which is exactly you ' ve got ) , kinda shows this is not a Thinking Man ' s ( or Woman ' s ) Movement . It ' s just like the Yippies of old " Protest First , think later . "
