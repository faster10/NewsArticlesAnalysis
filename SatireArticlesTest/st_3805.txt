" I now stand behind the amazing leadership of Bush and support the idea of focusing most of our military strength , money and every soldier available on Iraq . That is a good , well thought out , solid plan . I can ' t imagine why I ever doubted our beloved President . Sure we have lost 9 million jobs , our allies , a few buildings , a city , our military , and have overshot our federal budget . He still has some time left , I say we give the guy a chance to do something for a change . "
