Rev . Thadard , former proprietor of Area 420 and founder of S . P . A . C . E ( Solving People ' s Alien Concerns on Earth ) , said mass deportations will cripple the city ' s popular tourism industry , and plans to stage a protest rally in the town ' s square next month . " Our alien community is the heart and soul of Roswell . The city ' s economic and cultural heartbeat depend on them , " said Thadard . " Roswell should always remain a proud and safe alien sanctuary . Remember , of all places on earth , they chose us . Let us never forget that . "
