A medical student is often mistaken for a small , furry animal due to their undeniable cuteness . They are cute and shy because they are tremendously clueless and forgivable . Unlike small , furry animals , they do not have tails . A medical student is motivated by the quest for knowledge and a hope for a better tomorrow . A resident is always angry and bitter . A resident isn ' t clueless , just indifferent and jaded . There is no hope for anyone . The world is an oyster : a poisonous , ugly , diseased oyster . A resident is motivated only by coffee and sleep .
