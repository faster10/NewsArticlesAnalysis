One of the Peddle ' s neighbours , local busybody and retired racist Wally Spankerton , stuck his oar in . " The bleedin ' noise that pair make when they ' re shouting at each other does my head in . Having said that , it ' s not as noisy as when they get down to it . The sounds Mrs Peddle makes are horrendous . It ' s like when a fan belt comes a bit loose in your car only one hundred times louder and more annoying . That husband of hers is a poor sod . She ' s a right bloody pain in the arse . "
