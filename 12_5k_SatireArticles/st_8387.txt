Mickelson ' s playing schedule has been cut way back for the foreseeable future , to try and put a stop to all this hat tipping nonsense once and for all . " And please , " Mickelson adds , " I don ' t want to offend any military folks out there , or cowboys , the tipping was never about that . It was just a funny little thing that I picked up from a doorman , at a hotel in London , and just kinda rolled with it . I guess it got a little out of control and I apologize . ( But as he said it , he tipped his cap in apology even though he wasn ' t wearing one ! )
