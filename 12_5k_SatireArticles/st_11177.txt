" We have replaced human affinity with programmed televisual sentiment . Poor little Finnish puppy , poor little Iranian orphan , poor little Delhi prostitute . ( Laughter ) . . . " let me cuddle you " . . . before I switch channels and fetch a beer from the fridge . ( More laughter ) . How the sheeple get their flowers and hearts feelings all warmed up in their Boyscout Anglican Catholic holy identities by television . I need humility , I really do . ( Laughter ) . So effective , it is . Ah . . . the Americans , how bonded they are to things , to time and space , to insecurity , fears , self abuse , sex , illusions and money . Isn ' t it just wonderrrrfulllll ? ( Laughter ) .
