Commissioner for Transport For London Peter Hendy is no stranger to controversy . After proposals for the capital ' s Vertical Bus scheme in 2003 he found the sharp end of an deranged social activist ' s bb gun costing him an eye and the custody of his children . The buses failed due to the existence of bridges and despite Hendy ' s emotionally charged outburst in the House of Commons to blow them all up the buses were subsequently scrapped and dumped in a lay by in Hackney .
