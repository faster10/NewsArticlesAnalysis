" Clara ! " Molly said . " You ' ve been seeing too many spy movies . The young man is Professor Jeff Smith from the college . He is new in town . He came here from Florida State University , and he is helping to build a curriculum about religions of the world . It ' s a real challenge for a young professor and he is now the head of the department of religion in our small college instead of just another professor in a big university . Did you see the titles of ALL the books he borrowed ? "
