" It is true that , by restricting all smoking in the entire country to a cramped closet in a barely accessible rural hamlet surrounded by nothing but miles of flat farmland in every direction , we have helped reduce the non smoker ' s risk of exposure to secondhand smoke . But we cannot stop there . We must continue to lobby for greater restrictions until smoking is only allowed beyond the orbit of the outermost gas giant Neptune . "
