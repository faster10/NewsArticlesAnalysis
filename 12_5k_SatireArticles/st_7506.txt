Host Ryan Seacrest , who deflected rumors this week that he was gay , had a different take . " I ' m the guy who has to stand there every week and hug the contestants when they get a bad judging or get cut . I ' ve managed to cop a feel of all three girls on more than one occasion and have a firm grip on the situation . I ' m not going to say which one had the tightest ass or the best boobs , because I ' m not the kind to kiss and tell , but . . . . damn their all hot ! "
