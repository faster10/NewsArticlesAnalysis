" Man , it was a nightmare , just complete chaos " , said FBI agent Knucklehead . There were cookies strewn all over the place . Benches were smashed up and X Boxes and computers were in pieces . We had to rush in fast after the explosion to clean up all the cookies and save as many of them as we could so the cookie sale could go on . We definitely wanted to make sure that all the good cookies are picked up before we let any of the paramedics in to treat any of the victims . We didn ' t want any of them to step on any of the good cookie boxes . There is nothing worse than buying a box of broken cookies " .
