A Disney animator , Bigby Ackhole , that worked with the production of Venture Into The Woods , was openly disgusted about the outcome . " I kept on telling the team , I kept telling them , " he repeated . " that we needed another generic , white blonde haired princess , with a funny pointless sidekick , a one dimensional love interest , bland storyline , and unmemorable villain , but did they listen to me ? Nooooo ! And now they have this piece of crap . It is proven clearly through statistics that movies with white protagonists with little to no diversity and originality are MORE successful than diverse characters ! That ' s the motherflipping truth people . " He fumed out to reporters .
