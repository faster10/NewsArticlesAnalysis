' There was once a carpenter that made tables and chairs , and verily he was very skilled at doing so , and widely admired by all . But one day he retired . Then soon after the carpenter ' s shop where he had worked needed an overseer , and the carpenter went to the shop and sayeth ' Let me be the manager , for I knoweth how to make tables and chairs ' , but the owner of the shop said ' But you haven ' t a clue about management , what good would you be managing my shop ?
