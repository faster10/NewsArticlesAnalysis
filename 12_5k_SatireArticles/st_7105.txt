Frustrated with Booger King ' s belief in freedom , hard work , independence , and corporate and individual responsibility , Brown has called for a boycott of the fast food chain , asking Booger King customers to " dine " on Wendy ' s and White Castle ' s " cuisine . " Wendy ' s the senator points out , is headquartered in Dublin . He was not sure where White Castle ' s is located , but he believes its " Rome , Venice or Italy . " Both Ireland and Italy ( as well as Venice and Rome ) have higher , not lower , taxes than Canada , so Brown is " okay " with their having selected foreign locations for their respective headquarters .
