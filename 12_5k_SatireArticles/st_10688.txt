According to the insider , three of the arrested where part of an " organized tobacco cell , " operating between New York City and New Jersey . Allegedly , one member of the cell would operate as a lookout while the other two assailants would smoke cigarettes in various bathrooms , maintenance closets , and offices equipped with advanced air filtration technology in the lower Manhattan office complex where they worked . Under questioning , it has also been learned that it was common practice for a cell member to purchase cigarettes in New Jersey where he resides and tobacco prices are much lower , smuggle them into the city in his car during his morning commute , and then distribute them to the other cell members for an undisclosed amount of cash . " This must have been happening at least two or three times a week for several months , " confided the insider .
