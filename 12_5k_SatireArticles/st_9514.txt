" You can imagine how hard it is for me at my extended family reunions , " says Leo . " Me , I ' m single with no children or prospects , and I ' m broke , unemployed , and middle aged . My insanity keeps me active , but I have to work extra hard at those reunions to block out all of the success on display . I mean , one of my brothers is a doctor , the other an astronaut . My sisters in law are lawyers . My parents and grandparents are rich , as are most of my uncles and aunts . So when they get together , their wealth and happiness go with them . Their conversations and mannerisms overflow with signs of their normality .
