" I ' ve seen a lot of familiar faces since I ' ve been back it ' s amazing how many of the same families are still around after all these years , " Abu Dhubah said . " My friends always used to talk about how they ' d get out of here , but most of them never did . Sure , Bashir ' s in an Israeli prison these days , and I heard Ahmad and his kids have been gone since that IDF attack in 2014 , but pretty much all the rest are still in the camp , and they ' ve got families of their own now .
