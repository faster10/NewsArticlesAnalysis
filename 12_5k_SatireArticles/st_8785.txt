Al Qaeda responded by blowing up the reception area at a Sandals All Inclusive resort in Corfu in a defiant display meant to publicly reassert their dominance .

Al Qaeda ' s dwindling influence was confirmed by their demotion of two places in the Daily Mail ' s " Table of Terror " , where they were now sandwiched between Al Shabaab and Sepp Blatter .
