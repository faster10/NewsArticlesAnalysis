Despite the daunting task before it , the AAO is intensifying its efforts . They have scheduled a door to door canvassing trip in the village of Mochudi , to personally tell bedridden sufferers that AIDS is responsible for their ravaged immune systems . Additionally , they have set up informational booths in Jwaneng and Serowe to help spread the word that everyone in the village will soon die from AIDS , and they are giving out T shirts printed with the slogan " I Have AIDS . . . " on the front and " So Do You ! " on the back .
