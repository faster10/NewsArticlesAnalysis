" After class yesterday , I was hanging out with them , and he wouldn ' t shut up about it , " said Melissa Ayler , Jensen ' s best friend . " He was like , ' But it ' s got Robert Duvall ' s classic turn as the surfing obsessed helicopter squad leader ! ' Then he started quoting all these lines from it , saying stuff like , ' Charlie don ' t surf , ' and ' I love the smell of A bombs in the morning . ' At least , I think that ' s what he said I ' ve never seen the stupid movie , either . "
