The Right Reverend Lucius M . MacDonald read the last request exactly as written , saying " Well , I hope some folks showed up here today for more than just the potluck afterwards . Like most folks , I got me a last request . Mine ain ' t that my kids live right or don ' t turn into fudge packers or nothin ' like that . My last request is fer everyone to walk past my casket , cuz I did request an open casket , and fer you lady folks to give me one last look at yer titties before I plant me in the ground . "
