" Target scouted the Winesburg area last year but decided against locating there , " Wall Street Journal retail analyst Julia Faber said . " Their control group data showed that the town ' s residents were filled with a rarely articulated yet palpable anguish that meshed poorly with the exuberant image of the Target Corporation . The bankrupt Montgomery Ward , which closed its Winesburg location late last year , seemed more in tune with Winesburg residents ' somber , conflicted psychological state . Wal Mart , with its proven track record of leaving economic devastation in its wake , should be a good fit . "
