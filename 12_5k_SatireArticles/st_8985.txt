The location is to allay fears in Britain , that a site so close to Channel links combined with inadequate eurostar security , would make it a " walk in the park " for illegal entry into the UK . The camp will also provide skills training , in equine study , karate , greek mythology , swordplay , working with fibre glass , and paintwork ( mainly white paint ) . This will be under the supervision of the L gion trang re . A fast track course in claiming benefits in the UK is also under way .
