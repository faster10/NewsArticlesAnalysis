" And if we were walking down the sidewalk skipping stones after practice , LeBron would always say we should pick up the stones , find a lake and throw the stones into the lake . Titus and Bubba would say ' LeBron , the only lake around is Lake Erie and we just had practice and man , we ' re tired , and it ' s at least twelve miles one way just to get there . And we all have curfews and we can ' t stay out all night , walk all the way to Lake Erie and back , not to mention spend a couple of hours on the lake throwing stones into the lake , ' and LeBron would say , ' I don ' t care , I don ' t like kicking stones . I like picking them up and throwing them into the water . ' "
