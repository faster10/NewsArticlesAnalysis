The family who can still be spotted doing their weekly shop at their local branch of Lidl , spend twenty times more than an ' average family ' at the store . Branch deputy manager David Hullwick ( 19 ) said , " Sometimes when Michelle and her family visit the store , their bill at checkout can be as much as 46 , quite frankly they keep this branch afloat " . Hullwick continued , " I had her once you know , bent over a deep freezer " .
