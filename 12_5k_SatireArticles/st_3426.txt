" The Rocket Chef isn ' t sold in stores , so it ' s not exactly the easiest thing in the world to get your hands on , " he said . " Plus , the supply was limited , so there was the danger of it selling out . I didn ' t want to look like some kind of dope by missing out on the big offer . I mean , operators were standing by , but suppose they weren ' t standing by later . I ' d miss out ! "
