" It ' s something that is a little beyond your regular backyard apocalyptic scenario . Only the hardest and the holiest seem to make it through " said Merl Harcourt of the Indiana Revivalist Militia ( IRM ) . " Future generations of the IRM may want to re visit such a training scenario but for now it ' s coming out of the IRM Preppers Field Guide . Between you and me , I ' m glad he called it off . This will give us more time to work on our Santa Claus Parade float . "
