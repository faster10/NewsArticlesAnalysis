" There ' s a very short window at the start of school when I have to establish myself , and then I ' m that person for the rest of the year , " Valentine said . " One thing ' s for sure : If I don ' t get my act together , start pretending to like a completely different type of music , and choose to either love or hate team sports , then I won ' t have any option but to suck it up and go back to school as myself .
