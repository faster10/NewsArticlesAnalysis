Meanwhile , former MSNBC news personality Rita Cosby could barely contain her frustration . " This story was MADE for me , " she rasped from the stool of a nearby bar . " I mean , we all know who the father of Anna Nicole ' s baby is now , so THAT story is , well , you could call it , dead . Ha ha , I made a funny ! But seriously , people , this is a story I could cover like no one else . Those poor missing , beautiful young e mails . I can only imagine what kind of sick , perverted person would try to make them vanish in their prime of life . That person needs to answer for what he has done , and I am just the person to make him do it . But right now I ' m out of a job . I don ' t know what to do ! Right now , all I can do is sit around and drink with Don Imus and bitch about what an awful place MSNBC was to work . I should be OUT THERE , people , covering this story that is so crucial to the families and friends of these poor missing e mails ! Trust me , as soon as I can get back on the air covering this story , I will ! "
