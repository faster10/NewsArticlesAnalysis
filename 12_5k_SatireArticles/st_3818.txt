" There ' s no reason this Iraq thing can ' t be a franchise for us like those wars with Germany or the Communists used to be , " Rumsfeld said . " The public loves it , the soldiers love it , the media love it . And even if the U . S . wins at the end of the second one , there are still plenty of possibilities for a third : Saddam could be destroyed , only to be replaced by an even greater evil . Then , of course , there ' s the prequel set in the Stone Age , the era we bomb Iraq back to at the end of the third one . As far as we ' re concerned , this thing is just getting started . "
