The best of these crazy Africans is undoubtedly Ethiopian National Champion , Typie Pguppgdn . You thought Jimmy " Skinny Wrists " O ' Reilly ' s wrists were skinny wait til you see this guy ! Pguppgdn never had a keyboard as a child indeed his penniless family didn ' t even have a decent Internet server ( they had to make do with an outdated Novell Netware IP without even a dedicated Java IPU the sort of poverty the western developed world could only ever have nightmares about ) .
