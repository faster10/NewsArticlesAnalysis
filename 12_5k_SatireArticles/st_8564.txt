Remarked one bystander . " I like to play darts , but the boards are too small and I can never see where I ' m aiming for , not since that bloody great big dog stole my glasses anyway . Tennis is an absolute doddle in comparison . All I need to do is whack the ball into the huge area on the other side of the net , much easier than getting a pin with wings to fit in a 1 inch square on a darts board from 6ft away I can tell you .
