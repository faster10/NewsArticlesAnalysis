In 1984 , amid the Cold War fears of the Reagan Era , the breasts first emerged , developing simultaneously during puberty . Their first appearance in the public eye , as part of Playboy ' s 1990 " Breasts Of Summer " pictorial , led to a guest spot on the popular ABC sitcom Five Wacky Dads as the breasts of " The Sexy Neighbor Lady . " Though the role did not include dialogue , the reassuringly large breasts resonated with audiences gripped by Gulf War anxiety , and in the spring of 1991 were made a recurring character , which continued until the pair left the show in 1993 .
