" Football ' s just a kid ' s game , anyhow , and it ' s a damned shame grown men take it as seriously as they do . Like it ' s a life or death matter . They better put down the booze and smokes , get off the couch , and do something other than watch football . It ' ll be a life or death matter then . Maybe some of them will join my church and see the Light , " he said in a maudlin tone .
