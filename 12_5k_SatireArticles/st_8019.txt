" Do I go to the bathroom in my pants or on a toilet ? I used to think the toilet , but you know , now I think that might be wrong . Do I drive a car or try to ride backwards down the freeway on a unicycle ? Do I drink water or hot sauce ? Is it supposed to burn like that or is my mouth just sensitive ? I don ' t know . I don ' t know what is right or wrong anymore , but I ' m pretty sure that everything I know is wrong . "
