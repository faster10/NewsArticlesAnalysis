The government has raised the UK ' s current terrorist threat level to ' severe ' , meaning a terrorist attack is now thought to be ' highly likely ' , following an incident at the new Olympic Park in East London this morning after a fox was seen outside the perimeter fence on a CCTV security camera . A member of security staff monitoring the camera ordered a patrolman to investigate concerned that the fox might dig a hole under the fence and gain access into the Olympic Park . However , far greater concern came after the patrolman had gone to the location to discover that wedged in the fence a few yards away from the fox was a bandanna .
