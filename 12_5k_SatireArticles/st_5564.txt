" Out of the blue , it just snapped , " said Susan Matthews , 16 , a high school student working part time at Country Pantry Buffet as a cashier hostess . " I had just stirred the mashed potatoes , which we have to do hourly to keep them looking fresh and presentable , when I heard the squeaking sound of its little wheeled leg bases inching across the tile floor . I pulled the alarm , but it was too late . Before the building could be sealed , it had hit the swinging double doors of the loading dock at full speed . It was gone before I could rinse off my special sanitary plastic gloves . "
