" Rob invited Sheri because he ' s had a crush on her since fourth grade . And Tommy never does anything without his little sidekick Patrick , " Brandt said . " I just hope we have enough cigarettes , with so many people coming . We should be okay , though : Patrick ' s probably only gonna smoke one or two , because he ' s a big wuss and practically had to be forced into coming . Me , I ' ll smoke at least five or six . "
