" I figured my comeback would cost us a few members , " Jesus remarked , " but I was hoping we ' d gain a few hundred billion more . I can ' t say I ' m entirely surprised , though . Ezekiel , Isaiah , and Jeremiah mentioned something about the Son of Man being rejected and persecuted . I was hoping they were just drunk and talking out of their behinds , or that maybe they were referring to some other Son of Man but I guess they meant me .
