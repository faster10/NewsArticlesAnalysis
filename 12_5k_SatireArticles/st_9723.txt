During his ' ' This Week , ' ' appearance Mr Baker was shown a video of the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Senator John W . Warner of Virginia , who said last week that Iraq was ' ' drifting sideways ' ' and urged consideration of a ' ' change of course ' ' if the Iraqi government could not restore order in two or three months . The American ambassador to Iraq , Zalmay Khalilzad , has offered a similar warning to the Iraqi government . Asked if he agreed with that timetable , Mr Baker said , ' ' Yes , absolutely . That is why we ' re taking a look at other alternatives . ' '
