Prosser has long advocated draconian measures for " Those interfering swine " as he has often termed the offending clergy . Dr Rowan Williams , Archbishop of Canterbury , said in a press release " He is a man of great conviction and has taken extraordinary steps " . Local parishioners witnessed them first hand on Sunday when Prosser and Bloemquvist in an extended cassock nearly tumbled down the steps leading to the intricately carved wooden pulpit at Barnsley Cathedral . " It ' s a bit of a tight fit to get up there " said Prosser after the ceremony " but we made it thanks to a helping hand by the rector . "
