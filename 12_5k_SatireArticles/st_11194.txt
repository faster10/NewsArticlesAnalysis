" This haughty woman just came right in like she owned the place . I didn ' t pay her much attention she was fat and so . . . you know they ' re all so filled with a sense of entitlement . Fifteen minutes passed I hear screaming then she comes tearing out in the waiting room with cotton in her mouth and some needles in her cheeks . She ran out the door and flipped over the railing on the breeze way and landed the roof of my older son ' s Honda Civic that I was borrowing . She wasn ' t hurt . . . I don ' t think , but honestly I was glad she fell , she seemed like such a bitch . "
