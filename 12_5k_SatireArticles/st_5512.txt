" Parker isn ' t doing it for the money , " Kelp said . " He thinks he is . But I know why he ' s really doing it : the thrill of the sale . It ' s in his blood . He loves the plan , the pitch , the drama of it all . It ' s the only thing in his life he ' s ever been good at , and he knows it . It took him all of 36 hours to call me after he threw me off his acreage . Oh , he ' s in , all right . He ' s in for life . "
