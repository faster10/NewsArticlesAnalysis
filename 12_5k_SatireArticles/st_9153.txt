When asked what she was going to do with the money from the sale , Mrs Hutchins replied , " Well , I ain ' t going out and buying a new washer machine yet . If it sells for 3 dollars we ' ll get about a dolla fifty after paying the auction house . I ' m going straight down to Dollar Tree and I ' m buying something nice for myself . Maybe I ' ll get a bottle of that hair conditioner that smells like kerosine or maybe a coupla frozen dinners . "
