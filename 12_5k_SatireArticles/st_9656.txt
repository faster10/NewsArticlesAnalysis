Snyder ' s planned makeover of his team is not being ignored by other NFL team owners . For example , the San Diego Chargers are considering rebranding themselves as the " SEALs " in recognition of that city ' s location for training the U . S . Navy ' s Sea Air Land teams ( including the infamous " Hell Week " during which trainees are under mental and physical stress with very little rest for a whole week ) . Residents of Fort Bragg , NC are asking the owners of the Carolina Panthers to rename their team " The Green Berets " or the " Airborne " after the John F . Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School and the 82nd Airborne , both located at Fort Bragg .
