John McCallum , Canadian Minister of Immigration , Citizenship , and Refugees , issued a statement at a brief press conference on the developing story : " Look , it ' s not our proudest moment . But I think Canadians will be proud to learn that we made a concerted effort not to limit ourselves to only one type of mannequin . We didn ' t restrict the flight to only Christmas mannequins , for example . We brought mannequin families , black mannequins , and heterosexual and homosexual mannequins from sex stores . "
