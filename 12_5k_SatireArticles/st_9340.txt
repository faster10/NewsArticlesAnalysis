There is nothing like an Ion on a tear , loose in a kind of place where he really doesn ' t belong , belting them back and slowly losing his charge , chasing around a couple of thieving hookers and pissing off everybody else in the same area code with all these loud , appropriate and otherwise perfectly true observations about the differences between flat and curved paradigms ! As if anyone else could even think of half of one ! The hookers just laugh . All they have to do is to keep him thinking that he ' s chasing them while they are actually victimizing him !
