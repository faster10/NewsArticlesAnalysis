" I don ' t care how much Scotty wants it he ' s not gonna beat the Big Motherbucker , " Wiseck ' s friend Sam Lewis said . " His dreams are as big as the West Texas sky , but physically , he ' s just too weak . You need upper body strength to ride that thing , which is something you just don ' t get from driving a delivery truck all day . He should probably stick to playing foosball in the back room , where he ' s king of the table . "
