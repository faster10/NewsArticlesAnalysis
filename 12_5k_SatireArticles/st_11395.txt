Modeen Abdullah Armadj , owner of one of the independent transport haulers was tracked down as he was unloading a week ' s worth of waste from the Cloud ' n Heaven motel chain . Driving a WWII army surplus 18 wheel tanker , with Arabic scrolling on the side , he said the pay was so little , and the ride so far , and the wait so long , it was " just easier " to dump his load in the convenient and already engineered drainage pipes . He said he had no idea where the shit went , saying " only Allah knows . . . and I trust his judgement ! "
