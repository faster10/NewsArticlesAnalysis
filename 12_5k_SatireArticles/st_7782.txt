" What can be funnier than doing a silly walk towards your front door , in desperate need of the bog , buttocks clenched so tight they ' re throwing out sparks . . . and then you don ' t quite make it in time . You offload in your pants within whispering distance . . . That ' s it . You know you ' re a loser . You ' ve besmirched the holy unsullied canvas with last night ' s vindaloo . It ' s embarrassing not that I ' ve ever done it but it is hysterical . "
