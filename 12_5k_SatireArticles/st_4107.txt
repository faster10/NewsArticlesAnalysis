" It ' s pretty simple , really : Just lay out a clear cut , straightforward plan for a future in which we don ' t totally go down in flames on a grand stage , and you ' ve got my vote , " said Allison Joyce , a 47 year old middle school teacher from Bethesda , MD . " Look , I don ' t need to be inspired I don ' t need to be assured our future is bright I don ' t need to be told I ' m strong and resilient in the face of hardship . Just convince me we can get through the next decade in the least demeaning way possible given all our problems with childhood poverty , gun violence , and people dying because they can ' t afford medical treatment . That ' s it . "
