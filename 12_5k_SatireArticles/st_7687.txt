The game " My L ' il Farmyard Frolics " features a variety of farmyard based mini games in which the aim is to get a greater score than your competitor . Derek Dibdall of ' SPOONK ! Games ' described the claims as ' preposterous ' stating : " The mini game ' One Eyed Goat ' requires the player to grab the goat ' s neck with one hand and shake until the goat chokes up a piece of undigested food . It is an educational game that teaches positive animal welfare the idea that this is in some way sexual is preposterous . "
