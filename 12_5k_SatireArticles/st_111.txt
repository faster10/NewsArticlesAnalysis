Though he would like his parents ' permission , Rieder said he has not ruled out a covert roof visit . Without use of his parents ' bedroom window , which they keep locked at all times , Rieder ' s best chance for roof access is via a tree in the backyard .

The tree , however , is visible to anyone looking out the kitchen window , the very place where his mother stands as she does dishes and prepares meals .
