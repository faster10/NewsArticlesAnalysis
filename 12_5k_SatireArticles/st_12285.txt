" I have mandated by executive edict today that starting tomorrow the Catholic Church in the State of Pennsylvania will be required to collect a 22 . 5 tax on all collection plate proceeds , Bingo Cards , wine tasting parties , bake sales , raffles , funerals , wakes , weddings and a toll of 4 . 50 for everyone entering the confessional . To ensure compliance , and under the Universal Healthcare Law , which I today amended , I have directed the IRS to hire an additional 5 , 500 agents to oversee the collection plates each and every Sunday to insure that ' no skimming ' takes place in view of the current irregularities uncovered in the Vatican Bank .
