America liberated Afghanistan from a regime that hosted al Qaeda , banned kites and recorded music , and built a bridge to the seventh century . And what thanks does the U . S . get ? Over American objections , Afghan president Hamid Karzai last week released 65 Taliban warriors from Bagram prison , where they were being held on suspicion of killing American troops , murdering Afghan civilians , deploying roadside bombs , and otherwise perpetrating mayhem .

S . officials complained that these killers could return to the fight as have other Taliban thugs , once freed Karzai exploded : " If the Afghan judicial authorities decide to release a prisoner , it is of no concern to the U . S . I hope that the U . S . will stop harassing Afghanistan ' s procedures and judicial authority , and I hope the U . S . will now begin to respect Afghan sovereignty . "
