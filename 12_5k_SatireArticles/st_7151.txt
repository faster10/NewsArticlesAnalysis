" I obliged . It turns out Americans are turning to AK ' s in droves to fill their home armories . Russia doesn ' t mind , and neither do it ' s arms companies , like Izhmash , which are quickly shifting from military to civilian fabrication in order to fill all the orders . Overall it ' s been a good deal for American enthusiasts , and for Russian investors , since existing laws banning Chinese imports essentially subsidizes Russian businesses . "
