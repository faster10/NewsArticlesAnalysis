In protest , Muammar Gaddafi pitches a fit and then pitches a tent on a Donald Trump owned property . Gaddafi is accidently gassed to death when a flatulent camel is bedded down to close to the tent . While viewing the scene , Hugo Chavez attempts to blame George Bush , but while doing so looses his head ( literally ) when a cigar presented to him by Fidel Castro explodes in his face . This triggers the residual camel gas to explode and thus eliminate the need for packing up the tent . Donald Trump , standing close by , is unhurt , except for his hair which has been morphed by the explosion into a full mullet .
