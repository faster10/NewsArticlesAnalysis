Today ' s Observation from Throckmorton P . Turdblossom : I was watching some web postings yesterday during the Texas Longhorns vs . NMSU Aggies game . Twenty five minutes into the game , the score was NMSU 7 , Texas O . Everyone was calling for Longhorn coach Mac Browns head and whining about losing to one of the worst programs in football . At the end of the game , it was Texas 56 , NMSU 7 and all them same folks was trash talking about how awful the Aggies were . Seems they all have short memories in Bevo country !
