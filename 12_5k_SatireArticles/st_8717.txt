" It ' s an outrage ! " ranted German political analyst Jaeger Wynn . " I blame the Israelis . The maggots . Not content with bashing the Palestinians , now they ' ve gone and bought up all the bloody bacon ! Not that I ' m all that bothered , being a vegetarian and that . I ' m just praying that the shortages don ' t extend to quorn and mung beans . And that ' s my final word on the subject . You hear me ? MY FINAL WORD ! "
