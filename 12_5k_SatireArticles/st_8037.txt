Hold that betting line , Commissioner . I want to get in on this wager fest . I ' ll bet a brand new , crisp , 5 bill . My scientific method dictates that all the snow in your Seaport District ' s ' Trash Mountain ' will completely melt by January 2016 and that ' s when the Global Warming will start kicking in , melting everything , including the pack ice in Antarctica , around the North Pole and well into the Yukon ( but it will leave most of upper Siberia frozen as stiff as a bicycle tire ) . Unfortunately , much of the equator will freeze . The buzzword today is climate change not global warming or global cooling and it ' s really , really weird .
