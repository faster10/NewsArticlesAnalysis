Asked why they thought they were not better known , Ceres replied , " Are you kidding me ? ! Most people couldn ' t even name all of the planets much less concern themselves with a dwarf planet like me . I mean how could there be things out there with names like Makemake that more people haven ' t heard about ? This is clearly a case of educational apathy . If you can ' t learn it from watching " The Biggest Loser " or " The Real Housewive of Orage County " people just aren ' t interested in it . "
