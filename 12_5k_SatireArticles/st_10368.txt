" The era of capitalist greed is over " , President Obama told reporters , " in the old days we would have expected each industry to bail itself out by producing things that people actually want to buy , but in more enlightened times , each industry will be bailed out by the taxpayer , and in return the taxpayer will dictate how those industries are run , and the industry gets to force the taxpayer to buy crappy goods " . The President is not concerned that a bailout is futile in light of foreign competition " we can always close our borders to any foreign goods " President Obama said , " and that way people will have to buy the crappy products that our bailed out American industry manufactures because they will have no other option " .
