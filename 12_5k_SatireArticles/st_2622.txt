George said he had a meeting with Ron Brown he forgot about , and James made up some lame excuse about having to appear on Face The Nation . So , of course , it was just me and Bill , hauling stuff up and down that huge spiral staircase until , like , three in the morning . He bought me dinner as a way of saying thanks , but a couple of slices of pepperoni hardly makes up for 15 hours of back breaking labor . "
