Said Tamara Windsocke , owner of " Tamara ' s Tanning Salon and Pub " , ' something should be done about these half dressed Aussies . Being nude is natural , showing up almost naked is not right , it ' s puerile , perverted and un Canadian the men all get excited trying to visualize what ' s underneath it ' s not natural like , that , EH ? It ' s not like the Queen is coming an all when the boys fly their flag at full staff right embarrassing it is , especially when everyone ' s queueing up for a table on the patio for tea and a bit of crumpet !
