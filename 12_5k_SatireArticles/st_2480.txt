" As soon as my car started to skid out of control , I thought to myself , ' Oh , boy , this could be it I could be a big winner ! ' " said Cincinnati ' s Martin Frelks , who lost his wife but won 50 Sunday when the Buick LeSabre they were driving hit an oil slick at 60 mph and slammed into an oncoming truck . " When the car stopped rolling down the embankment , I knew Ellen was dead , but all I could think about was getting the blood and glass out of my eyes so I could read that airbag ! "
