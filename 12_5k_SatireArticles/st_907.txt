The history of the conflict between barrel conservationists and pop cultural manufacturers has been a long and bitter one . In 1994 , after a protracted legal battle with the Barrel Protection Agency , the recording industry won expanded bottom scraping rights , resulting in such platinum selling releases as The Eagles ' Hell Freezes Over reunion CD and The Best Of Shaquille O ' Neal . Brisk mail order sales of Pure Moods , featuring such timeless , soothing melodies as " The X Files Theme " by DJ Dado , only exacerbated the problem . In 1996 , deregulation of many previously protected sections of the barrel ' s lowermost surface area resulted in the prime time TV premieres of Nick Freno , Alright Already and The Brian Benben Show , among many others .
