I mean , of course Elvis died in 1977 ! What kind of a lunatic would you have to be to believe that he didn ' t ? What are people going to say next ? That the FBI were complicit in the assassination of Martin Luther King Junior ? That the government puts fluoride in the water ? That Elvis , Tupac and Amy Winehouse never died , but that that were recruited as agents of the secret world government as part of a shadow war against nazi communists ?
