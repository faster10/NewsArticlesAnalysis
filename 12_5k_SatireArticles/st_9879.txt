One industry expert , Mike James , has a more positive viewpoint . He says that , in anticipation of regulation in the death care market , there is likely to be a major shift towards medical care for decedents who were cremated , buried at sea , or had sky burials . " This segment of the market is out of the purview of regulatory authorities and completely untapped . People are generally regretful for putting their loved ones through such painful post death methods of disposal and surveys have shown that they are willing to pay a premium for death care services . We ' re talking economics 101 : higher costs of care for those who are in cemeteries will cause firms to switch to more specialized death care services that will yield higher profits . A professional caregiver for a vulture that ate a loved one , for example , is estimated to be only a tenth of the cost of exhumation alone and is a relatively low maintenance service option . "
