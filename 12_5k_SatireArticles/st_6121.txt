" Whereas previous generations of moviegoers would look forward to new movie releases and head to their local theater on a Friday or Saturday night , today ' s entertainment consumers are increasingly choosing to print out screenplays , cast friends and family in the various roles , and act out films without ever leaving their houses or apartments , " said MPAA analyst Tate Mitchell , citing the fact that in 2015 , more than 80 million households acted out summer blockbusters on their opening weekends , including Jurassic World and Mission : Impossible Rogue Nation , rather than viewing them on the big screen , a 14 percent increase over the previous year . " Savings aside , this option also provides people with a much greater variety of movies to act out , from the latest big budget action adventure films , dramas , and romantic comedies to Hollywood classics , documentaries , and foreign films .
