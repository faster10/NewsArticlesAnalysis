According to U . S . Justice Department records , between April 1996 and October 1998 , a staggering 15 car alarms went off in the borough of Brooklyn alone . Police estimate , however , that as many as two thirds of these incidents may have been so called " false " alarms , caused by children bouncing up and down on the tires , subways shaking cars slightly when passing underneath , or kittens rubbing their furry bodies against the vehicles in a stroking motion . Nevertheless , in the other one third of cases , police said the car alarms ' harsh , loud warnings played a crucial role in the swift apprehension of those responsible .
