" Dude man , I ' ve been saying for way too long now , so all you fascists better listen up , " said Dylan " Vapid Soul " Tucker , a local teenager known for his whiney , pitiable poetry and his extensive Asian tattoo collection , " A lot of us have got things to say , and we ' ve been saying them , or wanting to say them , and this just proves it , and now we ' re gonna start saying things , and you ' re all a bunch of damn fascists . Oh , and conformity is the death of individuality . "
