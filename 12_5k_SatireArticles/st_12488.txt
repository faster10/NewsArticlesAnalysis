" That ' s the good thing about being president , " Obama joked on February 10 . " I can do whatever I want . " In an especially bitter irony , Obama uttered these despicable words while guiding French president Fran ois Hollande through Monticello , the home of Thomas Jefferson a key architect of America ' s foundation of limited government . That very day , Obama decreed that the Obamacare mandate for employers with 50 to 99 workers would be postponed until 2016 ( beyond an earlier extension to 2015 ) , well past the November 2014 midterm elections . This eases the pressure on Democrats , whose campaigns would suffer if voters saw their company health plans canceled due to Obamacare ' s unnecessary , expensive , mandatory benefits e . g . maternity coverage for men .
