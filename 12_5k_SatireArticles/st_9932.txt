The incident occurred in June of 2014 . When Zack Tillim , 32 , boarded flight 2710 thinking he would make the 4 hour trip to Los Angeles , Ca without incident . About 30 minutes into the flight Mr Tillim states he began to feel bubbling in his belly . He was in the rest room for over 30 minutes when the flight attendant asked him to come out as others had to use the facilities . Upon taking his seat , several farts were heard and smelt as he walked down the aisle . Passengers began to ring for the crew and complain about the smell . Things got heated when a flight attendant wanted to see if the woman sitting next to Mr Tillim wanted a beverage but the woman would not wake up . One by one passengers began to pass out . The pilot released the oxygen mask and radioed the tower that an emergency landing was needed .
