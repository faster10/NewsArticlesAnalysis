" This is Madman Mike in the morning , and I am a member of the fourth estate , " said Antony , who was born Michael Kravitz in nearby Plovis and grew up listening to Q102 , then a classic rock station . " I have a responsibility to provide unbiased wake up zaniness , hard rocking hits and celebrity impressions , and that ' s a responsibility I don ' t take lightly . If I were to get in bed with every car dealer and theme restaurant that wants sponsorship , morning radio would soon be no better than the commercial wasteland of evening drive time . "
