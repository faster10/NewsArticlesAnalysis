Pac Man was asked if he had any advice for the wayward football player , " Yeah , grow up . If a ghost monster gets in my face before I eat a power pellet I can ' t go off on him all half cocked . Frankly , I ' d get eaten if I did . If Adam Jones can ' t handle a little trash talk from a retired linebacker when he knows his actions could cost him the game then maybe he ' s the one that shouldn ' t have been on the field . "
