The aging rock star Nugent , known as " The Motor City Madman " made the headlines recently when he proclaimed at a National Rifle Association event that " if Barack Obama becomes the president in November again , I will either be dead or in jail by this time next year . If the coyote ' s in your living room , pissing on your couch , it ' s not the coyote ' s fault . It ' s your fault for not shooting him , " he said . He also denounced the administration as " criminals " and said a Democratic victory in November would mean " we ' ll be a suburb of Indonesia next year " and called upon the audience to help him " clean house in this vile , evil , America hating administration " , adding that " We need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November ! Any questions ? "
