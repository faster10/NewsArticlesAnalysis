" You know this story is amazing , can you guys see the Dad ? He ' s here behind me tonight . I won ' t repeat the whole story tonight , it ' s so sad , but his boy ' s dying wish was to donate a kidney to me . He heard about the Oscar Clint Eastwood gave me and the Olympic gold medals that athletes are giving me and so at first little Joe Di Pitrio wanted to give me his award he won at his schools spelling bee . When they were on the way to my rally in Oklahoma City another car hit them and Joey , he never made it . "
