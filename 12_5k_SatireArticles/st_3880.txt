" Over the past 30 years , we ' ve developed a much better understanding of how blocks fit together , " said Dr Florence Edelman , the designer of a well known Tetris experiment in 1993 in which a perfect slot for an L or zigzag block was created under carefully controlled conditions , only to be closed off when a series of ill fitting square pieces appeared instead . " But without a working predictive model , our entire field of study is at an impasse . Indeed , reaching unpassable standstills is well chronicled in trial after trial . "
