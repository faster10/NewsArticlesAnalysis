The sceptical are not convinced by Sepp Blatter ' s platitudes , ' Blattertudes ' , if you will . It has been claimed that many footballers across the world have been approached by dark suited men with armpit bulges and Ladas with instructions that they should fail to perform against Russia , and play their socks off against the English , should they even qualify , which may not be possible if the latest FIFA ruling comes into force banning teams from countries beginning with E and ending with ngland . These men know where the players families and friends live , work and play . And should the players wish for their families to continue to live work and play in these places , they should think long and hard about the offer .
