A spokesperson for the volunteers said " Volunteering is a very rewarding option for people who have the time to spare and an interest in helping others . You might have to try a number of positions before you find the one that suits you . Volunteers are part of a world wide movement that serves charity and other organisations providing services to the needy . Volunteers would like to get a nice , warm feeling from their volunteer work . Because of the domineering office managers they aren ' t getting it . "
