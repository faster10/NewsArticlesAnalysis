He had such a sharp mind . We ' re all going to miss him " . Cilla Black , who reportedly dated Blobby in 2001 , described him as " big hearted and hilarious . A lorra , lorra fun . " And Blobby ' s flatmate , Phil Mitchell off EastEnders , said that " life without him is going to be tough . I don ' t know how I ' m going to cope . "
