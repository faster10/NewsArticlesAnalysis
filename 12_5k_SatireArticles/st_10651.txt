Enrico Encarnacion , the Goat Sucker being detained , declined to answer any questions relating to recent animal slaughters throughout the area . However , when asked about his reasoning behind his illegal immigration , he stated that " America is the land of the free and the rich , higher paying jobs means people can afford more , therefore livestock reserves are much larger here . In Latin America , the food reserves are quite small and the goat farming has declined considerably mainly being replaced by small chickens and guinea pigs . I can ' t feed myself , let alone my two children , with those scrawny birds and rodents . I come to America to eat cattle , bison , elk , and deer . "
