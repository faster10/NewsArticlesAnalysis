" I was cooking dinner one night , and Zac came in the door . He looked happy until he saw me . I was stirring the pasta sauce and he stormed up to me and put his hidden apron on me . At first I thought it was weird , but then I just forgot about it . I also spilled a drop of spaghetti sauce on the counter , and he jumped off the couch and cleaned it up . Sometimes I just wonder if he has OCD or he ' s just a homo . " says Corbin .
