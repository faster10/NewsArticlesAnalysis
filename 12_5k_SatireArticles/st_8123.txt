Kleinfeld is refering to the fact that there are over 90 , 000 drops of gasoline in a gallon of gas , and that 3 , 588 drops is thus a little under four percent of one gallon in 46 years of doing this . But that wasn ' t the worst of it . " The average time spent on that 1 2 3 , left right left shake was for Vern and most others studied , 1 . 5 seconds . " , reported Kleinfeld , " 1 . 5 seconds times the 1 , 196 times he did this over that 46 year period adds up to 29 minutes 54 seconds total . Assuming that Vern ' s time is worth at least minimum wage , he and the others have invested about 4 of their time for a lifetime return of twelve cents of gas assuming a cost per gallon of three dollars .
