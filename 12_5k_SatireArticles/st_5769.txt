Fresh out of the Army in 1946 , armed with a Graflex Speed Graphic camera and a tripod , Anszczak began his school photography career relatively late in life . The 34 year old entered a stagnant field , where the standard practice of shooting black and white snapshots of entire classes from a distance had gone unquestioned for decades . While it saved on film and developing costs , the process resulted in a final portrait in which many subjects were out of focus , too small to see , or obscured altogether . When Anszczak retired in 1986 , he left a field that had fully embraced his color close ups and woodland backdrops .
