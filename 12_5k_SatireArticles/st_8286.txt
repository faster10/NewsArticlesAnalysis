Christian told reporters , " It ' s not my poor performances or the teams disappointing run that made me lose my rag again . Frankly I ' ve come to the conclusion that I ' ve wasted my life playing this stupid game . I ' ve had enough of all the daft terminology . Googlies , leg breaks , silly mid this silly mid that . It ' s all a bloody waste of time . No one takes cricket seriously . You can stick the game up your arse . "
