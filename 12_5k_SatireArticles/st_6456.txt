Families of tornado victims are also fighting back . A 300 million lawsuit has been brought against Twister director Jan De Bont , and similar suits have been filed against the makers of other tornado glamorizing films , including The Wizard Of Oz . And more than 300 survivors of the Oklahoma tornado attack have filed a class action suit against director Oliver Stone for the " tornado jailbreak " scene in his film Natural Born Killers , which , like the Oklahoma tragedy , took place on the Great Plains .
