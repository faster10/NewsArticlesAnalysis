TALLAHASSEE In 2012 , Winston was accused of sexual assault by a female student . The medical examination showed the victim had injuries indicative of sexual trauma in addition , the victim identified Winston as the attacker . However , the Tallahassee Police never obtained a DNA sample from Winston , did not interview him , nor attempted to acquire the video of the assault by Seminoles teammate Chris Casher . As a result , a 2013 investigation by the State Attorney concluded that there wasn ' t enough evidence to file charges against Winston .
