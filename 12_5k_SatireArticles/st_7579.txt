The Consortium has a valid point . " Final " means " final " . Never again . Yet how many times has Michael said it was his final album , final gig and final video ? He claimed to had made his " final video " in 1990 and took the unusual step of hiring models to appear instead , so he could sit back behind the camera with a spliff and his boyfriend and do nothing but watch the money roll in . He reneged on that because within a few years this bearded moron ' s ego got the better of him and he began appearing in his own videos again .
