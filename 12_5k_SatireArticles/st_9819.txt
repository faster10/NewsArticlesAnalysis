Executive Order 13697 , issued yesterday , obliterates the 22nd Amendment , which sets term limits , by allowing President Obama to run for an unprecedented 3rd term . President Obama and his administration have failed to comment on the executive order but an unnamed source within the White House tells us , " Obama feels that his presidency was a complete success and a win for all Americans alike . He believes that he saved the country from imminent danger due to the previous president ' s lackluster and unsatisfactory performance . He said , ' I owe it to the American people to run for a 3rd term . I have repeatedly shown that I am the best president this great country has ever seen , it ' s only right that I upgrade the Constitution by passing this executive order . ' "
