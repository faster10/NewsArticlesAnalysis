" We are confident that today ' s ' troubled homeowner ' and I ' m using both those terms euphemistically now is so desperate to keep a roof over his or her family ' s heads that they will go for a loan extension well beyond the tradition 30 year mortgage , " said Andrew Payne , Investment Banker ( Buccaneer ) . " The mark I mean the ' borrower ' will have to agree to our ' re negotiated ' loan terms of extending their current 30 mortgage to a 60 , 90 and if you can believe it even a 120 year mortgage . Of course , it ' s all a ploy to ' buy ' time until we can pressure the U . S . Treasury to takeover our toxic assets . No . Wait . That already happened . "
