He stopped appearing in public the last two years of his life because he was undergoing a growth spurt . It hurt him to move about . As you know he had acromegaly a disease which makes one ' s bones grow forever . By the end he was twelve feet tall and weighed over two thousand pounds ! It took forever just to pull out his guts and look at them all . "
