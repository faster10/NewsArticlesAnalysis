But when it came time to graduate and Mr Farfenoogle was told the inner secrets of his craft , he became dismayed . " They showed me a list of principles , which they said were the bedrocks of politics . One of them shocked me and I still remember the exact words : ' When you ' ve run out of lies and you ' re in danger of letting the public see how hollow you are , just tell them we ' ve all got to move forward . ' That was it , you see . ' Move forward . ' But how could I resort to that vacuous clich , in my condition ? If I literally couldn ' t move forward , how could I rely on that stale metaphor to get me out of trouble ? Wouldn ' t that hackneyed standby line backfire on me ? But wouldn ' t I be a hopelessly ineffectual politician without it ? "
