Police were tipped off to the hoarding of human corpses by the Moskvin ' s parents , who live in the Nizhny Novgorod apartment with their son and discovered the bodies upon returning from vacationing at their summer home . The mother , Anna Moskvin , age 71 , said she thought something was wrong when she noticed that an arm had fallen off one of the ' guests ' in the TV room . " I knew something was wrong when that woman wearing the red babuska didn ' t even bother to reach down and pick up her arm ! "
