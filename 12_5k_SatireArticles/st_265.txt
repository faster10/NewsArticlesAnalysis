" Connie has this fantastic book of recipes her grandmother gave her , and she won ' t share them with anyone , " church organist Georgia Brandt said . " This year , I made white chocolate blondies and thought they ' d be a big hit . But most people just went straight to Connie ' s table , got what they wanted , and left . All the while , Connie just stood there with this look of smug satisfaction on her face . It took every ounce of strength in my body to keep from going over there and really telling her off . "
