" It sure would be great to play alongside Reggie White again I get chills just thinking about seeing him in the locker room , " Favre said . " That whole ' 96 defense is great , too . Santana Dotson is a force in the middle . That LeRoy Butler , I tell you , he ' s one of the most underrated safeties in the game . Desmond Howard isn ' t a bad kick returner , either . And unlike the Packer backfield I got now , the ' 96 Packers still feature William Henderson at fullback . "
