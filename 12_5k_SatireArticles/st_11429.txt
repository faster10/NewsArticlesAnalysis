Reggie Pease , the doorman at Fay Wray ' s apartment building , said , " Miss Wray was a very nice woman , but always a little nervous . She insisted on renting one of our basement apartments , and had a number of contractors install multiple layers of steel bars across her windows . She really liked to go shopping , but you could never get her to go down to Macy ' s or anywhere even near the Empire State Building ! Whenever that King Kong ' movie would come on television , I would bring Miss Wray a pair of ear muffs so she didn ' t have to listen to the neighbor ' s TV sets . "
