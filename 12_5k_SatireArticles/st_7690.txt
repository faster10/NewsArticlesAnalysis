In an exclusive radio interview Savage was quoted saying : " If I don ' t see you buying my album at the record shop this holiday season , I ' m gonna smash all your presents , put a pine tree in your butt and hang jingle bells from your nipples . Then , I ' m gonna drink some egg nog mixed with a little Pabst Blue Ribbon . Do a few lines of meth and then , when you regain consciousness , I ' m gonna wrinse and repeat , OOOOOH YEAH ! "
