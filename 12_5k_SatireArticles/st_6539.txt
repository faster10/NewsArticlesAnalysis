" I thought being a cop was hard , but it ' s not half as hard as being a pusher , " Bastone said . " You ' re hustling on the streets all day , then going to parties at night to build up clientele . And it ' s not like you can enjoy yourself at these parties . When you ' re there , you ' re networking and sizing up competitors and setting up deals . There ' s hardly a second to breathe , much less get your swerve on . "
