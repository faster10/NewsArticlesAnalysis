We now acknowledge that events in Nigeria , Maryland , Canada , Texas and the two reported Zombie outbreaks in Miami may be connected . We assure the public that there is nothing to worry about . However , as a precautionary method , we are asking that people refrain from drinking tap water , venture outdoors and do not eat contaminated food . Anyone recently arriving to these shores from Africa , specifically Nigeria , to contact the CDC , their local physician or in the case of visitors the nearest military base that contains an isolation unit . Anyone having any physical contact with any such person should also do the same .
