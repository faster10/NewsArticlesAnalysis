Using a complex mathematical algorithm , Ellie factors in the number of players , including herself , number of actual cards ( single , double , picture character ) in the 64 color card deck , as well as the 134 spaces on the board , then calculates the odds of landing on a shortcut , penalty space or , worse , landing on Gooey Gumdrops , getting lost in the Lollipop Woods , or stuck in the Molasses Swamp . She then uses advanced statistical analysis to determine the probabilities , averaging the length of play , and develops her game strategy accordingly .
