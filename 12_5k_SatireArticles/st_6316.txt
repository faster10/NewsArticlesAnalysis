His face contorted in the Misery of the Damned , a Disney lawyer said : " It ' s hell here there are no executive lounges , I can ' t get any decent risotto , and the suit I have to wear is a cheap Brooks Brothers knock off . I ' m beeped every 30 seconds , and there ' s no way to return the calls . Plus , I ' m being boiled upside down in lard while jackals gnaw at the soles of my feet . If I could just reach the fax machine on that nearby rock , I could contact some well placed associates and work something out , but it ' s just out of my grasp , and it ' s out of ink and constantly blinking the message , ' Replace Toner Cartridge , Replace Toner Cartridge , Replace Toner Cartridge . ' "
