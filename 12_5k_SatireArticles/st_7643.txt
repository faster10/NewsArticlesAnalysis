Alistair Predilleaux , VFVU spokesman , elaborated on the statement for reporters last night after sundown . " ' True Blood ' , while a slight improvement , continues the recent Hollywood fascination with portraying vampires as almost normal people who carry on regular daily lives except for the fact that they have to drink blood to survive . ' True Blood ' s ' vampires are at least meaner than the Hollister vampires in ' Twilight ' , but they nevertheless have the generic look of actors you might see on a soft porn Showtime movie . Let me just tell you : we are a brutal , bloodthirsty , vicious , f cked up bunch of creatures , and we live only to drink human blood . We don ' t own bars and restaurants , we don ' t secretly pine for the love of a human , and we don ' t want to ' fit in . ' In fact we have no recognizable human emotions whatsoever , only an animalistic urge to kill and feed . Unfortunately , it looks like that reality is about to absorb yet another kick to the balls now that the WB is getting ready to roll out ' The Vampire Diaries ' . "
