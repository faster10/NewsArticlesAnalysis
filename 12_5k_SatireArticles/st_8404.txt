" People used to say that I was Kaufman . I knew Andy and worked with him . But I stood on a stage with him . I also stood on the stage with Blatter when he came to Vegas in 1994 . He isn ' t Andy . He is shorter and fatter and he stinks . He only cares about money . Andy was a pain and I hated working for him but he always paid me on time , and he always paid me more than I asked . "
