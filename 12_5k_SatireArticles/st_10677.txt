" I knew I should have listened to Susie , " said Garlin , after a series of long , nearly gag point of no return , involved swallows , in reference to fellow " Curb " co star Susie Essman . " She always told me that Cubby Pubby was too obvious a brand , and that , if what I really wanted to do was to tap into the free flowing , take a leak on a side street , South Side crowd , then I should just stay with what got me into this position in the first place , and , you know , re name the chain " Fat Fu ' s " and just leave it at that . And , from there , just let it all slide down hill accordingly . Meaning , before I know what ' s what , and or even think to order up even more Thai food , I start raking in the dough , give the boys and all the downtown ward boss honks their cut , and , well , then just sit back and wait for Larry to not return my calls .
