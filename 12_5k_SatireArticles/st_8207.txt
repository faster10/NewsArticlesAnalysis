Most drivers will have experienced this annoyance . It is after all difficult to justify how over forty years after man walked on the moon drivers are still unable to stipulate how much petrol they want to have from the pumps before squeezing the trigger of the nozzle . Drivers going to pay for their fuel at the booths in the garage shops will either take ages trying to find the extra penny in their pockets , or as is often the case , the person behind counter will simply let them off and not charge for the extra amount of fuel the customer has taken . This has resulted in many service stations closing down says Ms . Van de Carr .
