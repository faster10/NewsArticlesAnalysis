L . A . Police Dept homicide detective Aseenam Duet told us that he found the case ' very strange indeed . ' Initially the only evidence they found was a printout on reams of paper coming from a printer directly connected to Deep Bluish . Detective Duet said , " We have arrested Deep Bluish with a view to a successful prosecution for murder in the first degree of Mister Einstein following a lengthy probe with the co operation of IBM . A weapon was seized after lengthy negotiations ( with the computer ) . Given the size of the machine it has been placed under ' house arrest ' or should I say ' office arrest ' heh heh " continued Det . Duet . The twice decorated officer added . " we understand that bail will not be sought , though we don ' t think it will try to abscond . . . heh heh "
