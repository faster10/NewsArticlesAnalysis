This however , is just the latest instance following six decades of being mistaken for Bergman ' s protege . To this day , people still come up to me and ask what it was like to play chess with Death , and to this day I have to tell them : " You ' re thinking of Max Von Sydow in The Seventh Seal . I am Christopher Plummer . I played Captain Von Trapp in The Sound of Music . " To which they usually say " wow that role must have got you lots of ass , " to which I reply " Yes . "
