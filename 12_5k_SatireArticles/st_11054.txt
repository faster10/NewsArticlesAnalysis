Palin broke her silence , declaring to FOX News , " I realize people will talk and smirk and say this is a Mayday December romance , but for those who know their geography , they know that May often is December , depending on which hemisphere you are in , such as when it is autumn Down Under it is actually springtime in Alaska . So , no , yes , we don ' t care what others in the lame stream will think we expect to be overjoyed .
