While the Ford camp boasts greater numbers the Densmore camp surpasses them in technological reasoning and quantity of beer . I have been informed by members of the Densmore camp that their larger cache of beer , in the past , has lead to grudging peace . Becky Densmore informed me while waiting to " break the seal " in the DMZ out house area , " The Ford encampment always doesn ' t remember to bring , you know , enough of their like crappy beer . Then , around two in the morning one of those guys will come here and stuff . And then they ' ll all come here . It ' s good family time . They just are too stupid to know it . That and they ' re all inbred bastards . "
