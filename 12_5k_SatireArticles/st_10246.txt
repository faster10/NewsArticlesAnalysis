Was he an Arab ? Can you describe him ? What color hair did he have ? Did he have a beard ? Was he wearing unusual clothing ? What was he wearing ? Did he wear dark glasses ? Did you notice the make and model and color of the car ? Was there anyone in the car ? Did he have to unlock it ? How tall was he ? How much do you think he weighed ? Do you think Smith is his real name ? Have you ever seen him before ? Are there any Arabs living in your town ? Do many tourists come to you town at this time of the year ? Have you ever met anyone from Florida before ? Did he have a wedding ring on his hand ? Can you remember any of the other book titles ? What else did he say ? Did he appear frightened ? Defensive ? Did he threaten you ? Were you afraid ? Do you think he was really a teacher ? Where does he teach ? Did he say what subjects he taught ?
