" I know my willingness to look at marijuana legislation again will hurt me with my Republican base , but I ' m willing to take a stand and allow some people to have access to recreational marijuana use , " he says . " I ' m not saying every low life in town should be allowed to get pot . I ' m saying we can find a way to distinguish who can use pot responsibly and who can ' t . A responsible person who pays his taxes , doesn ' t take taxpayer ' s hard earned dollars for things like welfare relief or food stamps , and doesn ' t engage in immoral same sex relationships should be able to purchase and use a lifestyle enhancer like personal marijuana without having to fear arrest . Would some welfare recipient be able to use marijuana to get her kicks while her children are stuck in front of the T . V . instead of reading books ? No , of course not . "
