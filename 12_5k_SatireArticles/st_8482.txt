Not surprisingly , some current NFL players are enthusiastic about the prospect . When asked , one Pro Bowler was quoted as saying , " I never know when I might get on the wrong side of the police again it would be nice knowing that I could still play . You know I ' m trying to stay clean and all , but sometimes you can just be in the wrong place at the wrong time . " Other players were more skeptical , with one player saying . " I didn ' t wish nothing bad on Mike ( Vick ) and all , you know , but I was kinda glad we weren ' t going to have to play him again , feel me ? "
