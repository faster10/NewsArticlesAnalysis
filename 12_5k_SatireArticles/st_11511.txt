President Obama is quoted as stating at a press conference , " Look , we all desire access to hag fish mucus . Some countries do not require it as much as others and I am not in anyway stating that I would like to or need to use hag fish mucus myself , but all nations should at least be able to profit from and use this miraculous fish within their own borders . The North ' s actions today only confirm what everyone had long suspected about their virility . The American people support South Korea ' s claims to its fishing rights and desire nothing more than for this matter to be sorted out as peacefully as possible . "
