I had a character called Kamb Reekie in the original Force Awakens screenplay . Kamb Reekie is a two foot tall , green and brown , neurotic , humanoid , alien . He ' s covered in gas sacks that release noxious gas when he gets touched or nervous . And to make matters worse , he ' s clumsy and always getting into trouble . We had Adam Sandler lined up to voice him and everything . Now fans will never see his vital role in the climatic sequence at Starkiller base , never get to hear him say his catchphrase " moopsies . " at 220 decibels of perfect THX sound . 97 pages of him . All gone !
