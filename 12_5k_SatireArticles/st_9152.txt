" She had no clue about shade , shadow , or scale , " said Paul Brandone , curator at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston . " This is what made her such a terrible painter and so uncollectable . She had absolutely no talent whatsoever and in fact was she banned from many art supply stores . Currently there are two Cotes hanging at the Museum of Bad Art ( http : museumofbadart . org ) and there is another Cote hanging on the boiler room wall in the Guggenheim . "
