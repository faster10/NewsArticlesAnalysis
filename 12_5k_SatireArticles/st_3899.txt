" I have to say , Money Man has really impressed me lately , " said poll respondent Mike Hargett , who is among the 45 percent of independent voters planning to cast a ballot for Money Man in November . " I voted for Black Guy in the last election , but I ' ve been fairly disappointed with the job he ' s done . As much as I admire Black Guy and his historic achievement , it just seems like the time is right for someone new with fresh ideas to come in and shake things up a bit . "
