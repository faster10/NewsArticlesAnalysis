" Someone from that company decided to fly a particular kite and it failed to make it off the ground and there will certainly now be an investigation by the White House into who it was that had the idea to try to fly that particular kite , and you can be assured that when that Mr or Mrs someone is found they will no longer be in a position to fly any similar such kites again in the near or distant future , and if I have my way they won ' t be flying any kites of any description that anyone will ever get to hear of ever again !
