Congressman Cary Elwes ( R California ) is the co sponsor of House Bill 1202 . Congressman Elwes ' office gave us this statement : " The new permits for Residents of the U . S . ( ROUS ) will prevent so many hideous problems with the TSA and the ' machine ' that they use to suck life out of passengers . We look forward to ROUSes being given the opportunity to skip the naked body scanners and remain healthy . If you haven ' t got your health , you haven ' t got anything . With House Bill 1202 we intend to rid the forest of TSA privacy thieves , even if we must use the brute squad to do it . We must end the ultimate suffering of children like Billy Joe Jim Bob Crystal . It ' s time for a miracle to save this country . It ' s time to get government agents out of the pants of passengers . Anyone who says differently is selling something . "
