" Most marijuana users are not good people , " says Stevens . " They ' re people who dress sloppily , have a lot of sex , and rarely drive nice cars . Not all users , of course . No one would say I don ' t dress well or don ' t have a nice car . And I can assure you I don ' t get a lot of sex . For that reason , I sincerely believed last year that the marijuana bill was wrong for our state , and that ' s why I didn ' t sign it . However , I say to our state legislators , if they want to bring the bill up again , I will take a hard look at it , because I see now that our current blanket restriction on marijuana possession is hurting people who are responsible users of this lifestyle substance .
