We also spoke to marine expert Professor Jens Convolvolus of The University of Jutland , who told us that " this is an ideal replacing of one creature with another of a similar environmental adaptation . The body is sparely covered in the short hairs , which may enable his tactile interpretations of his surroundings . These hairs are most developed around his mouth , which has a large horseshoe shaped upper lip which is a mobile muzzle very useful in his foraging . And the dugong is much the same . "
