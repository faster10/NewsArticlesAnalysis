" Almost every morning I ' d get woken up by Jeff ' s screaming , " Fischer recalled . " I ' d run into his room to see what was wrong , but he would just ignore that anything happened . He would say it was the neighbours or something . But I knew it was his lips . His mouth looked like a smashed asshole , and he couldn ' t say his Bs and Ps . I was thinking of sneaking into his room at night to lube up his lips , but that ' s kind of dangerous . Who knows what he would have done if he caught me ? He can get pretty violent when his manhood is questioned . "
