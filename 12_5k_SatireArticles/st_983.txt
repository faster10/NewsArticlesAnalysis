" How was I supposed to know that sending a text every single morning saying the world would be better off if she died would be the type of thing she ' d take personally ? said Boucard , adding that the recently deceased Gordon must have been a lot more sensitive than she thought . " I probably only told her once each day during gym class that nobody can stand to be around her or look at her pimply face , and that we ' re all waiting for her to climb into the tub and slit her wrists . Sure , from seventh through 10th grade I posted Facebook message after Facebook message to her timeline telling her that everyone who knows her wished she would just disappear and just because of that she killed herself ? Give me a break . "
