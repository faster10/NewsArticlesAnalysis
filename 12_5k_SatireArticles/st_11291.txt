" But I think the biggest reason I ' m pulling for Bush this year is because he ' s made it so easy for me to accomplish my goals . I mean , I never would have gotten away with that World Trade Center attack if the Bush administration didn ' t throw out everything Clinton knew about me and ignore all the clear warning signs coming from the FBI , the CIA and various world governments . I mean , any single one of my 72 three year old sons would be smart enough to figure out what I was up to with the evidence they had from Clinton alone and yet he ignored it all because he was more concerned about that Hussein pussy . Of course , this administration couldn ' t figure out that the Nigerian yellowcake uranium document was forged , even though it had the wrong dude ' s signature on it and the head of the CIA told them it was a forgery , so no big surprise there . And then when the second plane hit the World Trade Center , Bush just sat there in a room full of kids , he probably just wanted to know how Dick and Jane ended . We could have been aiming another plane at that school , but he just sat there unconcerned for a full five minutes he didn ' t care , no one in his family was killed . He knew this was a good thing for him , without that , he wouldn ' t have been so able to convince everyone that terrorism was such an imminent threat and they needed to go after Saddam right away before it was too late . I mean , I did him a huge favor here I suspect his failure to capture me after 2 years is his subtle way of paying me back ! Anyway , he dropped the ball before , so I figure that if I should decide I want to rain fire and brimstone down on America again , it shouldn ' t be too hard to catch ol ' Dubya with his pants down a second time .
