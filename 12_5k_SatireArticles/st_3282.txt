" Takeru used to live , breathe , and eat food , " said Hideki Ihara , Kobayashi ' s uncle . " Not a day went by that he didn ' t eat . He based his whole day around it . He ' d be down in the kitchen every morning at the crack of dawn , squeezing in an early meal . He ' d be the last one at the dinner table each night . In fact , he loved it so much that he would leave his job in the middle of the day and spend his lunch hour eating food . Now that ' s dedication . "
