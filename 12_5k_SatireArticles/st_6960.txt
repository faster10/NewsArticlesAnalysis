" Being amphibious means we can go after prey on both land and water , and we really think that ' s a trait we can leverage , " a Malayan horned frog said . " If a land mammal tries to escape from us into a river or pond , well , guess who has the upper hand in aquatic environments ? Similarly , if a bunch of sea lions are sunning themselves on land , clambering around on their flippers , we can sneak up under cover of water , hop ashore , and rip them to pieces . "
