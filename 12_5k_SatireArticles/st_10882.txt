Adding to the problem , Crimmons stated , is that negative publicity generated by the investigations can be so harmful as to inhibit the growth of a church community : " Can you imagine an event so shocking and unexpected for a church that it actually retards , or prevents altogether , its maturation into a viable , healthy diocese ? This is no bizarre fever dream from horror literature . These random and utterly indefensible child rape investigations are actually happening , in my church and yours . It ' s so unthinkable that you almost have to block it from your mind just to stay sane , but if we call ourselves human , our duty is to fight it . Fight it until not one investigation is happening . "
