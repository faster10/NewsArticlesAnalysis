" Do I hold my breath to spite my constituents ? Not on your life ! I inhale and exhale thousands of times a day , laboriously going through those motions , taxing my lungs , and I do it to carry out the public will . They didn ' t elect me just to keel over . No sir , I assure you I ' m very much alive as I doze off at my desk . With each breath I take I get stuff done , adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere to feed the plants which in turn supply oxygen to my constituents to working men and women and to their children . You ' re welcome ! "
