" If we want to have any chance at all of saving this planet , we need to get started right now , before it ' s too late , " said foundation president Sandra Wright , warning that while the condition of Mars has remained stable for millions of years , it could be gravely threatened by pollution , toxic waste , or the exploitation of its natural resources as early as the next decade . " We only have one shot at getting this right , and the earlier we can get a jump on it , the more hope we have of salvaging at least some of this magnificent planet ' s pristine landscape and crystal clear yellow brown skies .
