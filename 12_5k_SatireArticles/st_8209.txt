' When people first linked their computers to the SETI home experiment , ' explained the SETI Institute ' s chief executive , Tom Pierson , ' large numbers believed that if they located extraterrestrial life , the aliens would materialise near their computers . Many kept a spare bed made up for such a visitor and a few extra cans of beer in the refrigerator . This , ' he continued , ' was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the science . SETI scans signals from space to find messages from other worlds . There is no possibility of personally meeting an extraterrestrial . The home computers simply analyse data . '
