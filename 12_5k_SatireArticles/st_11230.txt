Australian IT Contractors Association is rendering assistance to the raided geek who was later found by British backpackers wandering the outback in a daze and is said to be heavily traumatised after the raid and under heavy sedation at an undisclosed location , further delaying when he can get back to fix the census server farm .

When asked about Turnbulls broadband NBN he indicated that in conjunction with Revolution IT in Melbourne when stress testing his modem had actually been faster and more reliable .
