The expert accompanied this reporter to the 3D TV section at an electronics discount store in the Akihabara section of Tokyo Monday . Wearing the 3D glasses , I was able to see through the fabric of the attire worn by people on the TV shows . The people did appear to be nude . Because it is 3D x ray vision , the various bulges of the naked human body really jump out and grab you . Only humans are rendered naked . Monkeys , ferrets and other animals commonly present on Japanese TV shows appeared normally when viewed in the 3D glasses . The x ray effect was visible on all the brands of 3D televisions .
