The always caring Mayor of Little Divot , Mr I . M Tetchy , gave a characteristically sympathetic view of the situation , " I couldn ' t care less . These young morons will eat anything when their drunk . I once saw someone leaving the ' Shit ' s and Giggles ' club eating vomit out of a rubbish bin . If you ask me it serves them right . It ' s a shame none of them died . If they had it would ' ve been a warning to others about the dangers of eating poor people ' s food like the filthy muck that is a kebab . They should all be put on kebab skewers in the village square and made an example of . "
