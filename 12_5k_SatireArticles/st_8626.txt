" We wanna see a team like Barcelona at the Villa , " one said . " Not a team like Doncaster Rovers . No disrespect to Doncaster Rovers like , but you know worra mean we won the European Cup once for God ' s sake . We have an image to uphold . Our aim is to get this city purron the map as a hotbed of football . It ' s footy mad is this city , especially the Villa bits we ' ve got fans who come in from as far away as Dudley and Kidderminster you know yet all people seem to wanna talk about when you mention Brum is the bloody Bull Ring , Baltis , Spaghetti Junction , canals and Adrian Chiles . Alex McLeish isn ' t likely to change that in a rush mate , I can tell yer . "
