" Not only does this film feature a Fox as the main character and " hero " , but the entire premise of the film , as with all stories that glorify that terrible outlaw , is disgusting too . Robbin Hood is the total opposite of what our government stands for , robbing from the hard working upper classes to give money to the scrounging , unwashed poor . I remember seeing it as a child and crying when Robin was caught and going to be hanged , then was freed . "
