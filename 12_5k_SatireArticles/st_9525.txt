Asked by Cooper why God led so many people for so long to believe that hell was real , God explained , " It ' s a behaviorist technique I thought up to get people to behave , kind of like the lump of coal that so many parents use to scare their kids into behaving . It ' s my way of scaring ( excuse the pun ) the ' hell ' out of people , who are , in general , predisposed to lie , cheat , steal , sleep with their neighbors ' wives , and all those other commandments that Moses supposedly brought down from Mount Sinai . "
