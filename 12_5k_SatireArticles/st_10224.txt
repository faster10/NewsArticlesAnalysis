Rhonda Manning , 17 , of Santa Rosa , Calif . wasn ' t concerned about CVC 21800 ( b ) ( 1 ) for the most of her driving career . She even hadn ' t known what the Vehicle Code was up until last week when she was carpooling with her friend from softball practice . When Ms . Manning was nearing a 4 way stop intersection , another car approached from the street at her left almost simultaneously with her . Before Rhonda and the other driver begun the usual pantomime of waving each other through , her friend suggested her to use the CVC 21800 ( b ) ( 1 ) , thus avoiding the delay and a potentially costly misunderstanding .
