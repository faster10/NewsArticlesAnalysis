It is reported that Prince Harry managed to wipe out a total of 37 Spaniards en route without wasting a shot , doubtless attributed to his excellent RAF training .

Luckily , being a trained pilot Wills was able to bring the helicopter down after cracking a couple of Estrella Damm wiping out most of the estates spacious tennis courts in the process !
