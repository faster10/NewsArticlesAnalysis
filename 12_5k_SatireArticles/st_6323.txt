Owens later amended his complaints about any possible future quarterbacks with whom he might play , saying he " did not mean to disrespect McNabb , Vick , McNair , Peyton Manning , Favre , Eli Manning , Pennington , or anyone else who might be throwing to T .

He also took back " anything he might have eventually said " about McNabb ' s toughness , Vick ' s accuracy , McNair ' s age , Peyton Manning ' s inability to win the big game , Favre ' s attempts to force bad passes , Eli Manning ' s inexperience , and Pennington ' s overratedness , though Owens refused to revisit his future comments on the sexual orientation of Detroit Lions backup Jeff Garcia .
