Past tense instruction is only the latest school program to face the chopping block . School districts in California have been forced to cut addition and subtraction from their math departments , while nearly all high schools have reduced foreign language courses to only the most basic phrases , including " May I please use the bathroom ? and " No , I do not want to go to the beach with Maria and Juan . " Some legislators are even calling for an end to teaching grammar itself , saying that in many inner city school districts , where funding is most lacking , students rarely use grammar at all .
