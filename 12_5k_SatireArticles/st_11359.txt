When asked if Turkey had chosen a particular denomination of Christianity , Turkish Foreign Minister Mr Gul answered , " That is of course a detail yet to be worked out . We are open to all possibilities and will be taking offers . " At the same time a foreign ministry person wishing not to be identified confirmed rumors that the Vatican had offered significant financial options , whilst the Russian and Greek Orthodox Churches had merely offered generous salvation for all the new souls in Turkey . When asked whether there were minimal terms expected from bidders , Mr Gul responded , " Given current instabilities in this world economy , we are unconvinced about promises with too long time horizons , plus any offer that involves the other world should at least equal the four maidens and plenitude offered by Islam .
