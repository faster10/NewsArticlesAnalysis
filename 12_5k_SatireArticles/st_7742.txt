Some speculation revolves around allegations of misconduct with American Idol ' s sweetheart judge Paula Abdul , but a source close to the show said that that rumor was false .

I ' m not even sure with as big as Scott is that he can clean himself properly , and Paula is part Muslim . They are very clean people you know . "
