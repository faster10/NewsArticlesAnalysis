A retired Malaysian wood chopper who spent most of his entire life working in the small village of Juntar , Grantabunto ' s ratio of facial wrinkles to age was believed to be the highest anywhere in the world . Indeed , some of his wrinkles ( in and around his eyes ) measured less than 0 . 03mm apart . Apart from a small section of his cheek , friends say Grantabunto had " hardly any smooth patches of skin left on his face " . Experts say he could have " easily passed for a 112 year old " .
