Explained Principal Henri Depardieu . " The children were ill prepared . Many of them thought they could walk to Paris from Normandy in an hour or so and a couple even tried and most of them expected to be fed burgers , hot dogs and what they called " freedom fries " . I am afraid they did not get any of that . Here , at ' des Roches , we do not believe in competition . We do not encourage children to hate each other or themselves and so , we do not give them silly marks or trophies for natural achievement . You learn here because you want to , for no other reason . The student does his best for himself , not for us . Here , we teach you how to be a human being first and foremost . . . to examine your beliefs and where they come from and when you leave ' des Roches , to help the world become a healthier place than when you found it . Here , we teach you how to bring happiness and joy . . . first of all to yourself and then to all you may meet in your journey through life . It is that simple . If we can achieve that we have done our job as teachers . I am glad they are back home where they belong . I cannot help but feel sorry for them . "
