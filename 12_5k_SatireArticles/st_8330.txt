However things took a shocking turn when Alan " Angles " McManus turned up at the crucible to get some early practice in ahead of his Quarter Final with Mark Selby . " I was up early and got to the crucible about 8am " says the tartan trousered Angles . " I wanted to get a couple of quiet frames in on the practice table before anyone was about . And that ' s when I heard some funny noises . Not the typical noises of the practice room , the sound of balls clacking as they drop into the pocket , I could hear the floorboards creaking and a lot of screaming and shouting . "
