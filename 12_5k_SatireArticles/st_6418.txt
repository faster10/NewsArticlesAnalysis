" When I started out , I would take an occasional exhilarating midday nap , but I would always pull back from the edge by walking around the neighborhood or doing a little bit of yard work every so often . Now , though , that won ' t cut it I have to keep taking things to the next level , " said Erickson , noting that he is no longer content with spending merely four or five hours playing Xbox or watching only a portion of a daylong Breaking Bad marathon . " The thing is , sitting there for just the standard 8 p . m . to midnight block of primetime television just doesn ' t carry the risk I need to get my adrenaline flowing anymore . Now , I ' m pushing myself further than I ' ve ever gone before , sometimes confining myself to the same spot on the couch for 16 hours at a time . "
