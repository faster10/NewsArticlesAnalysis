Admittedly , the fedora and trenchcoat might seem like an overly formal combination to wear on a day to day basis . That ' s why I make sure to always dress it down ' , by never pairing them with anything more dressy than comfy jeans , my lucky pair of white running shoes , and a T shirt with a joke about the words " Their and " There and how " They ' re not the same . It ' s like mashing up different genres of music , or fusion cuisine , only with your clothes .
