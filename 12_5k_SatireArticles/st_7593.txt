" In hindsight I guess the writings always been on the wall , we just didn ' t want to see it . The Beatles never really existed . Right ? I mean , all that crap about " Paul is Dead , Paul is dead " I mean , of course he was dead . So was John . Or more precisely , they never lived . The photo ' s , the gigs , they were all just stand ins . I mean , look how many Beatles cover bands there are now , right ? Why not save all the hassle and just create a Beatles cover band to actually BE the band in the first place right ? I ' m increasingly of the opinion that they actually had a couple of bands who were " The Beatles " , you know , like how the Americans have stand in Presidents and stuff . One Beatles is at the BBC doing some radio interviews while another Beatles is sound checking for a gig and a third band is hanging out with groupies . Great marketing , great concept and it explains why there is enough material recorded by them to cover three bands ! "
