Jelinek gets riled with some frequency . Over her twenty year tenure as president of Washington based American Women for Equality ( AWE ) , she has raised her manicured fist against many an injustice : the price mismatch between men ' s and women ' s haircuts , the scarcity of ladies rooms in university engineering buildings , the disrespect for women ' s maternal role evident in the widespread use of such phrases as " the mother of all bombs .
