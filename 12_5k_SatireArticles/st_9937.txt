The upcoming changes mentioned in the statement have since been added to the online version of the campus master plan . Changes will include the removal of all heating and air conditioning units from university houses , insertion of bedbugs into all university provided beds , mass excavation of previously filled pot holes on Kiefaber and Lowes Streets and replacement of all meal plans with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( formerly known as the Food Stamp Program ) . In addition , Facilities Management will cease the weekend removal of student trash from campus properties and salting pathways in the winter . Career Services , a widely used campus resource that helps hundreds of students mold career paths and find jobs every year , will also be disbanded .
