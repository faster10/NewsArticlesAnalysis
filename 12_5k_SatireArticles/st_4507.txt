Although the sole film made from Salinger ' s work , My Foolish Heart , based on his short story " Uncle Wiggily In Connecticut , " was considered by Salinger to be such a bastardization of his prose that he never agreed to another adaptation , he now states that " if McG wants to do any of my stuff ' A Perfect Day For Bananafish ' Raise High The Roof Beam , Carpenters hell , all of Nine Stories he has my complete permission . Anything . Anything he wants . "
