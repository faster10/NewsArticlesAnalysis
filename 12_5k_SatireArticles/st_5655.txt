" Saddam is a very powerful man with a larger than life presence , and when he ' s in that cell , there ' s no mistaking who ' s in charge , " said a special forces officer who commands the watch of Hussein at an undisclosed location in Iraq . " We gave Saddam a small bag of nuts . While he was asleep , the rats got into the nuts and ate some of them . In retaliation , Saddam caught one of the rats ' young , tortured it , and left it strapped to the wall with dental floss for days . Then , after it was dead , he stuffed its severed head with nuts and paraded it around the cell to warn the other rats . "
