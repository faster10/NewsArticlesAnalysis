In the Large Nosed Exemplar shown here , a battery of intelligence tests placed his I . Q . between a ground squirrel ' s and a wolverine ' s , or 56 on the Bressler Marron Glace ' Equivalency Index of comparative cortical thickness and mammalian intelligence , long ago created by Nobel Laureate William Shockley in his ground breaking experiments , which indicated that the subject ' s cortex should be . 03 MM thick . The studies at the Harvid Psychonasopharyngeal Institue indicated that the subject ' s cortical depth would be . 032 based on the psychonasophyrangeal scale that found his nasophyrangeal malar process to be equivalent to an acorn squash of 72 days growth . A difference of only . 002 and well within the margin of error !
