Moline , Indiana The unmarked , gunmetal grey 18 wheelers which began a two week period of constant comings and goings in early January , 2003 , did arouse the suspicions of some of the residents of the " Grande Finale Trailer Village " . The Village is located on the opposite side of Hwy 37 from the abandoned " Ten Pin Alley Bowlerama " . Most folks just assumed that the equipment was being removed by the owners for resale , but some swore they never saw anything being taken out of the building .
