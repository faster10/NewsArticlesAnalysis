Door handles , it seems , are equally dangerous . " I ' m forever catching jumper sleeves , hood toggles and my hair on door handles , " said Bump . " I nearly ripped my hand off when I got my wedding ring caught on one . We ' ve yet to come up with a viable alternative , but may involve automatic doors that go ' swoosh ' as the open to make them like Star Trek . They don ' t have door handle problems do they ? "
