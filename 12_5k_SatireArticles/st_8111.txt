BOULDER , CO . ( SN ) A new study has shown that Daffy Duck is dramatically more effective in treating certain types of cancer than trained , praying healers . " Needless to say , this was somewhat unexpected , " states lead researcher Ima Fakker RN . " I ' m sure if we had compared our trained healers to the Roadrunner , or even Porky Pig , we would have shown better results . But it ' s tough to beat the duck , " admitted Fakker .
