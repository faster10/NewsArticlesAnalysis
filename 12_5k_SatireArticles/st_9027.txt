" Trolley mishaps occur now and then . Sainsbury ' s has had its fair share of 6 year olds mown down by runaway trolleys and dismembered by renegade baskets , but our victims always survived until now . We are , however , taking steps to make Sainsbury ' s a safer place to shop . We want our customers to know that when they shop at Sainsbury ' s , they are shopping more safely than in rival supermarket chains . Our initiatives include trolley speedometers and corresponding aisle speed limits . Shoppers will , most likely , be limited to 20 aisles per hour , and any person crazy enough to exceed this will be snagged and bagged ' , perhaps fined accordingly .
