During the past few months , I have become extremely saddened , very saddened indeed , to find that those hard working men and women in uniform , our very well trained military recruiters , charged with such an awesome responsibility , have had an extremely difficult time fulfilling their quotas of soldiers necessary in order to defend our country . What has gone wrong ? Why has it been so terribly difficult for our recruiters to find men and women willing to serve their own country ? How could such a thing be ? Surely we have not become an indulgent nation , a nation of selfish folks willing to partake of the benefits of such a fine society , yet without the courage , nor even the integrity , to do what must be done in order to defend our country from her enemies . Such an unwillingness to go to war for one ' s own country , a nation that has given so very much to those of us privileged to live within its borders , is frightening . Frightening in that it is clear to me , as the President of this great nation , that such an attitude could well lead to the downfall of our country , a nation that has been a bulwark of freedom for the world to follow , a once bright light having become dim , darkened by the shortsighted and narcissistic fears of its own people , a shadow of tyranny and domination that would be allowed to spread across the rest of the world leading the planet into a nightmarish hell of despot dictated domination !
