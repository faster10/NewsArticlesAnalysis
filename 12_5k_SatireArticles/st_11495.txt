" Women Bad " is definitely Amadinejad ' s favorite " cheer me up " tactic , but it has a draw back . " I think he would use " Women Bad " more if the Pope would stay out of it , " explained Middle East expert Hugot MacRude . " Every time Iran wants to stone a woman to death , the Vatican gets involved . I don ' t know what it is , but for some reason , the Pope really gives Amadinejad " The Willies " . So , I would think it will be the bomb game this time . It ' s fun for him and it only involves the United Nations . They may threaten more sanctions but he knows the worst he ' ll get is a resolution . "
