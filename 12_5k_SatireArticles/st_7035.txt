Andrew Zimmern from the Travel Network TV show Bizarre Foods has been retained to get the new chain of fine food establishments on its feet and running . His job will be to identify the best sources for the viscera and to help train chefs in their various unique methods of preparation . Most ideas for the menu will come from areas of South America , Asia , and Africa , but Zimmern says there will be a limited number of seasonal specials based on preparations from more temperate climates ( think putrefied shark meat from Iceland ) .
