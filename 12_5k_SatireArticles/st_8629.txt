The child , who cannot be named for legal reason , was hurried away by his Mother . It ' s an absolute disgrace ' she said to me later when I called the hospital . My son has been a life long fan of United and Keano and we came up especially from London to lend our support . It ' s disgusting how he can treat his fans this way . It ' s the first time we ' ve ever been north of Watford and I ' m not sure we ' ll bother again ' .
