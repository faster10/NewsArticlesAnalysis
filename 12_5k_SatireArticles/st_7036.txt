Zimmern was reluctant to give away too much information about the Innards menu before any sites are open , but he did share a few hints . " We will of course have all the standards that everyone knows and loves . Things like heart , stomach , liver , and tongue . But where we really hope to make our mark is with the more exotic meats like pancreas , brain , pituitary gland , rooster testicles , and yes , intestines . " He went on . " There is a whole world of people out there that have lost the food preparation skills and tastes of their grandparents and great grandparents . People are interested in getting back to their roots . We think this is a market waiting to explode . For example , many people assume that they would not like the taste of intestine . But I can assure you , blindfold someone and serve him or her a hot , steaming plate of fresh mountain Yak intestine stuffed with diced red potato and wild rice , simmered in a buttery brandy rue , and they just go wild over it !
