" It was a scary man who hit me ! " Scotty exclaimed . " I was just riding on my new Schwinn when I heard a noise behind me . I turned around and there was a guy with a scooter coming after me . It wasn ' t an electric scooter either . It was one of those one ' s where you have to push with one leg to make it go . He was really good at it too . He was going way too fast for a dirt road . I was going faster , cuz my Schwinn came with off roading tires . But he was just too good , so I got really tired and fell off . "
