On the Japanese Tragedy : Well , that was just a horrible thing what happened to them folks . I wouldn ' t wish that on nobody or their mother in law . First , you get shook up by an earthquake , and then you go and wake up and find out that you ' ve got a Tsunami . I don ' t know why anyone would want to get their lawyer to file a Tsunami ( and I don ' t rightly know what a Nami is , but it must be some legal thing in those Jap courts ) right after you get rocked by an earthquake . You just don ' t do that to folks !
