" After the meeting , I was having lunch in the company cafeteria with Eric Miller , James von Lustbader and Frank Clavell , " office comptroller Timothy Marzano said . " I looked down for a moment to take a bite of my sandwich , and when I looked up , Frank ' s head had been cut off and placed on his tray , Eric had been sliced in half so neatly that his hair was still in place , and there was blood dripping from the ceiling directly above James ' chair . " Von Lustbader ' s dismembered body was later found inside the ceiling .
