The situation has gotten so out of hand that protest leaders have purportedly setup internal , self police squads to stop the out of control behavior . One of the individuals who is part of this security unit told the media that the organizers want to make sure everyone is at the protest " for the right reason . " Immediately afterward , he pulled out a drug pipe and smoked by what all accounts must be marijuana . Maybe the ' self police ' have a new and unsual crowd control device Don ' t listen to orders than blow drug smoke in their faces ! Yeah , that ' ll fix ' em !
