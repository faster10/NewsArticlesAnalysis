At that point all semblance of civility was lost . Several PETA protesters started dumping tar on the AFLAC representatives and topping it off with feathers . When it was pointed out to the PETA people that the feathers they were using had to come from somewhere and that somewhere was more than likely dead ducks , well let us just say that it was not a pretty sight . AFLAC executives were running around , flapping their arms and quacking . PETA protesters were yelling that they were not real feathers , that they were synthetic , man made . This caused the AFLAC people to continue their taunting and pretending to shoot each other so they could lie down , give a last quack and die .
