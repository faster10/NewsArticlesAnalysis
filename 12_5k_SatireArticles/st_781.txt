Messner rejected the criticism . " Not everyone in this area cares or is even aware of how dam building alters an ecosystem , " Messner said . " But I am , and , yes , I do wonder what kind of impact my dam will have on the environment . How can I make this the most positive experience possible , while still minimizing adverse impact on the wetlands ? What kind of beaver would I be if I didn ' t take erosion science into consideration ? " To that end , Messner has reached out to the local otter , fish , and waterfowl communities , and has incorporated their input into his design .
