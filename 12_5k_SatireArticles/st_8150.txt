Last Saturday , one man got that chance . We will not reveal his name , so he will be referred to as Q . We got a chance to speak with him on Monday . he explained how he figured out the code : " All I was doing that morning was hanging a picture in my bathroom . I was standing on my toilet , when I slipped and hit my head on the counter . . . I woke up several minutes later , my head . . . clearer than it had ever been . All of a sudden . . . it came to me , as clear as a bell . I wrote it down as soon as it happened , in case I lost it . "
