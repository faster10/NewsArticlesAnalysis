" We ' ve got all these Volts that are DOA which we can sell to the movie , which we will be funding . Then , the production company gets the 7500 dollar taxpayer funded rebate , and the climax of the show will be a low speed chase on the freeway , much like the OJ episode , where we somehow manage to have 237 Volts crash thru barriers , roll over on exit ramps , jump open drawbridges , and burn out their brakes when they end up in San Francisco chasing each other up and down hills at 18 MPH ! Then there ' s the insurance payouts ! "
