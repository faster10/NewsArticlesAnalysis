' It ' s hopeless , ' said one of those random shoppers that reporters accost in the street when they want a quote from an ordinary person . ' I ' m not an expert on politics , economics or sociology , and I ' m not going to become one before the vote . There are lots of people who know more than I do , but , based on the same facts , those people seem to be split into diametrically opposed camps . If clever , well informed people can ' t agree on what ' s best , how can I ? '
