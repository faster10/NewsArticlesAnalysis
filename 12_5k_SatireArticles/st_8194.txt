The thinking at the time was that the heat induced in the wiring would not only conduct through the frame of the conservatory but owing to the ionisation effect of the resultant radiated energy , a ' skin ' effect would occur with the glass making an ' effective ' insulation layer . Most of the heat would remain within the conservatory . The temperature created was sufficient to maintain enough heat for the plants to survive which not affecting or cracking the fragile glass . The heaters would allow ' extra ' heat to be delivered to particularly sensitive or valuable plants ( in addition to their use in the coldest of weather ) . I shudder to think at the wattage actually used , that alone the harmonics induced .
