An exec from Warner Bros . Studio who wished to remain anonymous offered up his opinion : " This is a TV sitcom . Acts of drunkenness and prostitution are meant to be funny . They are funny . Well , they are funny until the authorities get called into it . Once the authorities are called in , it stops being funny . It has stopped being funny for Mr Sheen . We license this show for distribution to the CBS broadcast network , not for their Showtime division , so standards have to be set . Right now , Mr Sheen is not available to meet those standards so the production of ' Two and a Half Men ' has been delayed . "
