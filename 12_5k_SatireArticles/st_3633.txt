" Stacy ' s the head of the decoration committee , so at least I know she ' s planning on going , " Autry said , adding that the way she transformed the conference room into a winter wonderland last year was " unforgettable . " " I heard they ' re doing a ' Starry Night ' theme this time , and they ' re going to get all these glow necklaces and stars . Bottom line , if Stacy ' s in charge of it , it ' s going to come out looking great . "
