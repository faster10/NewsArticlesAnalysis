" Steve definitely looks to be an improvement , " said gaming enthusiast Jennie Weathers , 28 , who planned to attend a demonstration at a Las Vegas electronics trade show this weekend . " The Larry was clunky , slow , and always making noise . Steve has a lot more free time and the flexibility to adapt to Sony retail stores and shopping sites like SonyStyle . And it seems like he ' ll require very little upkeep or attention , but he ' ll still be there when I just want to chill out and watch DVDs on my Sony WEGA HDTV or need some quick cheat tips for Kingdom Hearts II .
