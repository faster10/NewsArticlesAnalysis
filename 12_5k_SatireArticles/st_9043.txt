" Mr Gates was disappointed to learn that as an American citizen he is not entitled to use ' Sir ' before his name , " said William Shawcross , the queen ' s official biographer . " When he was told he could put the initials ' KBE ' for Knight Commander of the British Empire after his name , he complained that no one outside the UK would know what that meant , and that people in the United States might think he was a chiropractor or something . ' He was also miffed that his wife would not be able to call herself the Duchess of Redmond . "
