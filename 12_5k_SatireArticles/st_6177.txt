" Any time a large animal dies in a suburban area like this , it tends to push the real estate market downward , " said Russell Abernathy , an independent realtor in nearby Arlington Heights . " Early in my career , I was helping an elderly couple sell their two bedroom home , perfect for a young couple just starting out . But it remained on the market for nearly 10 months , just because a horse had died on the lawn that summer . It wasn ' t until the horse had rotted enough that the only remaining trace of it was its bleached bones that I was finally able to find a buyer . And even then , we closed at only half its original value . "
