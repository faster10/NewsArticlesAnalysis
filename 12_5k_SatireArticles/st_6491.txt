" Last week , Mr Rogowski was all up in my face about how I got to go to the job center , " said Manny Acevedo , 18 , who has struggled with substance abuse for more than three years . " I told him I didn ' t have no ride , so he says he ' ll drive me himself , and about an hour later , he shows up in the sorriest car I ever seen . Me and my sisters , we was laughing our asses off as he pull up . I was like , ' Why don ' t you go to the job center , Mr Career Advice Man ? ' Cause with that car , it ' s pretty obvious you ain ' t getting paid . ' "
