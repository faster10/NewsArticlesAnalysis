" The chef , he always wanted to date , or you know have this girl as a mistress , Belinda , because he is married . But Belinda , she always said no and that she would tell his wife if he didn ' t stop bothering her . One day she was just gone , and her boyfriend was coming by to find her and the chef said she moved to Chicago . But no one really knows what happened and some of the other girls we worked with think he did something to her , made her leave , or maybe killed her . But after that nobody in the kitchen would eat the ground beef they put in the tacos and enchiladas , and for weeks some of the kitchen staff did the sign of the cross for Belinda whenever a combo plate went out .
