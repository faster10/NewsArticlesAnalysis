Mar . 6 : we finally got around to unpacking the boxes we brought with us . I found out that Akmed had forgotten to pack the camcorder , the video tape player , the microwave oven and the Cuisenart . I gave Akmed quite a scolding . I asked him how we we were ever going to overthrow the decadant satanic western civilisation with it ' s relieance on its godless science and technology if we did not have the proper tools . I sent him out to find the nearest Radio Shack to replace these items . This latest incident put me in a very bad mood , dear diary . Now I will not be able to watch my Britany Spears video until Akmed comes back .
