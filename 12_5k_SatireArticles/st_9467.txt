The Cardinal continued , " The position of Holy Mother Church is unequivocal . The Most Supreme Holy Father Bunkum IV first put it forth in a Papal Proniciado Magnificum Bullshitum in the 5th century . He stated , with all eloquence and authority , which is applicable to the Muskegon situation , " It ' s bad luck if the mother dies in giving birth because she was denied proper health care . But , let ' s remember , she ' s provided another soul for Holy Mother Church to program . Alleluia ! "
