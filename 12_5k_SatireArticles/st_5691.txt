The first major breakthrough in the quest to achieve a grand unified theory occurred in 1971 , when an Oxford University physicist working with extremely high energy particle accelerators successfully proved that Time and Life are , in actuality , a single entity known as Time Life , fused together long ago in an event known as the Big Merge . In 1982 , a Tokyo University team discovered that , under certain conditions , particles within the Time Life continuum could be exchanged with reactions caused by the strong and weak Warnerlar forces , creating what theorists call the " Time Warner " force .
