" It does get to me , of course , " said John Buccigross , who has been a SportsCenter anchor since the mid 1990s . " I went through a really bad time there for a while . I had some really dark thoughts , drank too much , hated myself when I should have been hating what this cheap , loud , blaring , stupid network has done to my love of sports . I was afraid for my career . God help me , I was afraid for me . But as bad as it got , I never gave in to the impulse to jump up on my stool and use the noose I tied up there in the studio ' s lighting rig . See it ? Right there . "
