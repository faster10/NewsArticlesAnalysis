Minister for Death , Phil D . Coffin , claims there is nothing he can do about the situation . He uttered , " There is nothing that I , or the police , can do about it because we don ' t care about anyone but ourselves . To be honest , I ' m quite envious of Athieva ' s brilliant entrepeneurship . It really was an ingenious plan . Shame it failed . We need more companies who will do anything to make a quick quid in order to make rich people even richer . "
