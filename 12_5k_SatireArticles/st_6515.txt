" The bitter tears of forlorn women flowing for seven years without ceasing is a grave global threat that we can no longer afford to ignore , " said U . N . magical realism expert Dr Adam Weber , noting that a devastating increase in soil salinity and a corresponding spike in grain prices can be linked to episodes in which a young bride , and then her mother , all of her sisters , and her aunts , begin to cry after the family ' s most beloved son is taken away and raised by the wealthy but cruel landowners in the valley below . " Should these sorrowful individuals continue in their lamentation , particularly when they see their lost love ' s face reflected in the changua soup they are preparing , our research predicts mass global flooding that displaces hundreds of millions of people living in low lying coastal areas , putting pressure on already finite natural resources and causing untold trillions of U . S . dollars in lost GDP . "
