The other striking thing we learned was that whales are being harvested at a dramatically increasing rate . Since July 2011 , the number of whales caught by Japanese boats has increased from about 85 whales per month to an astonishing 104 per day . That is about 37 times more whales going under the knife . These numbers are estimates based on the increase in people processing the blubber . It is also corroborated by some of the old timers . The Chinese man who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity also told us that he used to work with about 80 others . The workforce , by our estimates , is now roughly 2 , 960 people . While we were inside the refrigerated section , we counted more than 85 whale heads and a similar number of dorsal fins .
