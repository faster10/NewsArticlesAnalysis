Speaking for the greater part of an hour , Romney said he was particularly shaped by his father Rufus Romney , a strapping young man with " tattered shoes like Swiss cheese " who left early each day to work in the wheat fields outside Memphis . Returning at night with a tired look in his eyes , Romney said his father would gather his children around the table to share a can of tomato soup and dream of one day living in a " big house on a hill , " a dream Romney said later inspired him to pursue a career in business .
