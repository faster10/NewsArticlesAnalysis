Another unnamed associate at Mossack Fonseca was uncharacteristically happy to discuss O ' Leary . " I wouldn ' t even know the man ' s name , but he ' s been calling us ever since the news story , begging us to launder his Dragon ' s Den royalty cheques . " The unnamed associate was then overcome with laughter , adding , " The kind of amounts he was talking about we literally use funds like that as toilet paper in the employee washroom ! And in Canadian funds ? Get out of here . "
