The Pope really is Catholic : " Though they are in process of changing Popes this month , we have learned for a certainty that all Popes in the recent past have been Catholic . Several of our Seal Teams infultrated Vatican City on covert missions on multiple occasions to be able to gain this information . These men did this willingly for their government , regardless of the threat to life and limb and exposure . Their data confirms that the Pope , along with the members of the College of Cardinals , are all currently of the Catholic faith . Members of the Arizona Cardinals football team , St . Louis Cardinals baseball team , and Stanford University Cardinal athletic teams are of many different religions , but each has several Catholics on rosters . No member of these groups , however , are currently Pope or have been Pope . "
