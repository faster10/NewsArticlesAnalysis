We aren ' t sure what is up ahead , but we can imagine it is quite interesting judging from the way Ms . Showbottom is covering her mouth with one hand and hunched over holding her ribs in apparent pain caused by trying once more to stifle a bout of laughter . " And now , ladies and gentlemen , we are entering the ' other ' right wing , " she says as strange noises emanate from her nostrils . ( Steady , steady , calm , she tells herself ) " Mr Limbaugh refuses to believe that a left wing even exists ( gurgle , snort , whistle , phew , my God , I ' m sorry , but I can ' t do this any longer , help me Jeezusss ) .
