" The game was a joy to play at first , " Mitchell explained . " The track ball was fun to use , the mazes were original , and challenging . I breezed through the practice , beginner and intermediate race levels . I found to aerial race to be one of the best designed boards of any game I have ever played . I had just gotten past those french fry looking hammers , and was on my way to a record score . " Mitchell went on enthusiastically . " But , then it happened . . . "
