The Constitutionality of this proposal still needs to be vetted , but Bob Andreluski , of the ACLU , states , " We want the rights of every individual protected , but if they agree to the terms and they know the consequences , I think there is high percentage for success . He goes on to say that , " There is really no down side to this program . There is an immediate release from the overcrowding in the prison population and if there is a high failure rate for the inmates then that would make room for new volunteers to this innovative reform " .
