Hassim tells us that Limbaugh said something to the effect that the only Americans he knew that belonged here are ones that look like him ( Limbaugh ) not Hassim and intimated that Hassim sounds like a terrorist name . At that point , Hassim decided that no matter whether he needed the job or not , he could not take one more minute of this bigot , " and right then and there , I pulled the car to the curb , in not so nice a neighborhood , I might add , told Mr Limbaugh to give me his cell phone , which he did because he was like a frightened baby , and then I told him to get out of my limo right there , in front of Pradesh ' s Pawn Shop , I told the fat man to ' please sir , get out of my limo . ' "
