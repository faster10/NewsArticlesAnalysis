I am happy to see too that the New World Order is getting better coverage in our press . Once upon a time it was . . . excuse me . . . a . . . " conspiracy theory " . ( Uproarious laughter ) . Soon , cheerleaders will be wearing Tee shirts with " We Love The NWO " emblazoned on them . ( More laughter ) . By making Barack Emperor of America I believe we have broken new ground . The finishing line is now within sight when we finally take control of the planet . We will drill our troops with hymns of victory and martyrdom in case they think the war has to do with oil and world domination and all that stupid conspiracy stuff . ( Laughter ) . They will march into battle as " soldiers of Christ " . Where would we be without the Jesuits ? A toast to their leader Pope Francis ! I taught them everything they know .
