Savani Mentos who headed the research explains how they reached their conclusions : " After both George W . Bush and Obama each won their two presidential elections , two percent of the country actually did leave , though the impact of population loss was mitigated by the influx of immigrants , but the point here is that 5 percent said they would leave the country , while only about half of that number actually did leave . " Backing up his numbers Mentos said , " So , with almost fifty percent of respondents saying they are leaving , we are pretty comfortable with a real figure of at least twenty percent emigrating after the 2016 elections .
