" Drinking tequila is like playing with fire : It warms you up nice , but if you ' re not careful , you get burned , " Streeter said . " One night back in college , this guy Andy Nardo got so polluted on tequila shots that he thought he was Mr Fantastic . He kept going on about how he could stretch his arms out like rubber . We had to pile on him to stop him from knocking shit down . Nardo was so sick the next day , he thought he was gonna die . Leave the Cuervo alone if you know what ' s good for you . "
