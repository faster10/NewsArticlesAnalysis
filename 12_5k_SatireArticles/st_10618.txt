I left him in a neighborhood that might not be as friendly to him as I had tried to be , but I did it because he needs to learn , though I doubt he will . In the meantime , I now have a 200 cleaning bill for the stench that was left behind , but it was worth it to see the look on Limbaugh ' s face in my rear view mirror as I drove away and left him to fend for himself for a change and it felt , well , liberating .
