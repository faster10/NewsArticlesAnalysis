" It ' s obviously a watershed moment when a player from the NBA announces he ' s gay , but most people forget about Montreal Canadiens winger Steve Shutt , who came out back in 1972 , " said hockey historian Hank Crerand , noting that Shutt was the first of many gay NHL players to reveal their homosexuality . " Even though gay athletes still carry a stigma today , it ' s nothing compared to the ' 70s . The likes of Shutt and Gordie Howe faced not only vitriol and discrimination from fans and the media , but also their own teammates and coaches . "
