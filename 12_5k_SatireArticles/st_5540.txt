Speaking with reporters as they exited the museum Tuesday , young visitors were near unanimous in their praise for the facility and the activities it offered . " They had all sorts of cool outfits to dress up in and fun things to play with , " said 9 year old Dylan Titus as he held up a black and white photograph of himself wearing a studded codpiece and a boa constrictor over his shoulders , which was taken at the museum ' s Mapplethorpe Juniors Photo Booth . " I got to play with a real bullwhip , too . It was so much fun . "
