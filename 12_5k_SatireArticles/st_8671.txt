The survey team contacted the ageing Judas Priest front man , Rob Halford , to obtain a comment from him . Halford said , " Look , people know I ' m getting on a bit , but I ' ve never been truthful about my age . The fact is , I was a couple of grades ahead of Jesus at Bethlehem State School . I remember him as being a real gent and good at woodwork . Also , for a kid that came from such a poor family , his mum used to send him to school with divine packed lunches , which old JC had a knack of making go a long way . It wasn ' t me who betrayed him , I never said a bad word about him " .
