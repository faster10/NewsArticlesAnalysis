5 . Here ' s an illustrated print that is certainly for the adventurous among us , which is hopefully you , as you creep over to the motionless body you woke up next to in this wholly unfamiliar windowless basement . As you get closer , you realize the print is actually two separate prints , at the exact same moment that you realize the body is not breathing . You turn the corpse over That face ! It can ' t be ! You scramble up to gaze into the framed print , and your worst fears are confirmed ! The face you see staring back at you in the reflection of this illustrated print is the same as the face of the dead man you ' ve woken up beside ! How is this possible ? Where is this house ? And where can you buy this bold , textured , illustrated print ?
