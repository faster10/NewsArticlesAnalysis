" Don ' t be sad , " Packer head coach Mike McCarthy told fans , many of whom began crying audibly , shaking their heads , or turning away at the news . " You should be happy for Brett . He is in a much better place now . He has many of your other favorite Packers , really great Packers like Reggie White and Ray Nitschke and Max McGee , to keep him company . And he even has a coach Vince Lombardi is on that farm , too . "
