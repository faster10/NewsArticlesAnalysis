Obama did not take questions but closed with the following statement , " I am often accused of being a socialist or a tax and spend liberal , but as you can see I think outside the box . My team and I have worked hard to find a way to pay for our plans not just run up the deficit . The fact is eight years of failed Bush policies is responsible for how expensive this health care bill , that was released last week , will be . And I am the one to fix it . But the critics are going to tell you that this is un American but how is this different than selling naming writes to a football stadium ? Besides I don ' t hear anyone else tying to find a way to pay for this thing that was thrown in my lap . "
