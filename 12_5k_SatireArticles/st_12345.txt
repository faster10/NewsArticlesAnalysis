Laws to regulate the size of soft drinks , a war on styrofoam , smoking in open air venues including beaches , and not to mention local and state governments proposing , and in some cases passing , a hodge podge of ' gun control ' measures that will lead to hundreds of supreme court cases caused by a rush to judgement and ignorance while no mention is made of thousands of gun deaths of black youths in democratic controlled urban centers where the gangs are better armed than the police !
