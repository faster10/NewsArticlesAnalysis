Logic also dictates that 5 million years from now humans will also be looking at them with more advanced technologies and there will be an intelligent coexistence between humans and more advanced life forms since we can never become a threat to them and as we evolve more we will become more acceptable to them . There will be a point in our evolution where we will lose all primitive emotions , we will no longer depend on the process of molecular exchange to exist , and we will lose our physical forms and our ability to reproduce . We will eventually become part of a non physical dimension . If a person can hear his thoughts speaking in his mind then the human mind is already evolving into this other dimension .
