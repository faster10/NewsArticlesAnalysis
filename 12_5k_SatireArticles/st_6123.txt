Additionally , 72 percent of respondents said they enjoyed the flexibility of home acting versus watching movies in the theater , noting that if one of them needed to use the restroom or get more popcorn during a pivotal scene , the actors could pause the performance and do another take when the person got back . Nearly two thirds of those polled also cited a lack of advertisements before performances as a benefit , as moviegoers were able to jump right into the film without performing any trailers , or only act out the trailers they were most excited about .
