Last , and certainly least , was James Meigs , editor of " Popular Mechanics " Magazine ( proving that you don ' t have to be popular nor a mechanic to work for " Popular Mechanics " ) . Meigs , who has no scientific background at all , is one of the most highly regarded experts on 9 11 and actually has produced a remarkable film on the subject called " How to Make your own Music Video " . James can talk fancy and memorize stuff really good and looks real smart in glasses .
