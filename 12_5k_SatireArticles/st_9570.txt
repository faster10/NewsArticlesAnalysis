It is strange to think that in all this time those guardians of the gates of our moral and political purity Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , Glen Beck , Ann Coulter and the other saints of FOX ' s conservative elite , have not seen this peril within their very midst and spoken out against it . Some skeptics theorize that these very subversive elements have ironically helped to fund FOX ' s war chest with their vast appeal and popularity . This would make FOX a two faced entity which could surely not ever be true .
