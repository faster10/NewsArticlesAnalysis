When further asked by Mr O ' Shea how might she feel if someone tampered with her pussy ? Ms Bale replied . " Oooh , yes please young man , your place or mine ? " Making his apologise O ' Shea hurried off to interview council spokeswoman , Mrs Emma Royds , about the ramifications of dumping the incorrect ' rubbish ' in the wrong wheelie bin . " This is in direct breach of Council regulations " slavered Mrs Royds , " the council has gone to great lengths to supply householders with the appropriate bins . All we ask in return is that residents do not mix their rubbish , is that too much to bloody ask ? In the event , we shall be taking appropriate legal action against Ms Bale and she can expect a hefty fine and a criminal record , that will teach the bitch ! "
