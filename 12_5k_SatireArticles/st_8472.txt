Governor Bill Richardson responded by saying that " I was drafted by teams in the old AFL and NFL . I think that I ' d have to support the teams that drafted me . . . the Dallas Texans and the Los Angeles Rams . " When told that these teams were now , respectively , the Kansas City Chiefs and the St . Louis Rams , and reminded that he had never been drafted in football ( he has always lied that he was drafted in baseball ) , Richardson had no comment .
