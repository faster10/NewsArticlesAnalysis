TURIN , ITALY Jay Khadka , a renowned Sherpa and Nepal ' s representative in the men ' s downhill skiing event , expressed disappointment Tuesday upon learning that the Olympic Committee would not be taking participants ' time of ascent up the mountain and degree of route difficulty into consideration when awarding medals for the competition . " I have been training for what I believed to be the first half of this event for my whole life , " said Khadka from his training base camp 8 , 000 feet up the sheer face of the Dolomite Mountains in the Italian Alps . " I climbed and skied down Everest three times in 2005 to ready myself . Now they tell me everyone else is taking a ski lift . I may as well just take my skis , poles , helmet , goggles , two pounds of dried food , signaling mirror , oxygen tanks , compass , and space blanket back down the mountain and go home . " Khadka also informed Olympic officials that Austrian skiing legend Hermann Maier , whom Khadka was guiding up the mountain , would also not be competing in the event , as he died of frostbite about half a mile back .
