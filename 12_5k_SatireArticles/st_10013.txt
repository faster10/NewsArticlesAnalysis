Washington ( SAPP ) In a strange twist of fate , the bathroom debate has come to a screeching halt . The U . S . EPA , an unlikely actor in this political saga , has settled the issue once and for all . In a blistering beat down of the political Left and Right , the EPA has formally ruled that bathrooms can no longer have walls due to everyone ' s right to " free expression . " The bipartisan panel of experts , all with 10 or more years experience using public bathrooms , concluded that bathrooms should be " open , inviting , and convenient . " The panel stressed that bathrooms should not be " echo chambers " or " enclosed " any more to allow people the free expression of sights and sounds and odors . The panel stressed that without walls , graffiti would " be eliminated . "
