" Aneesha really knows travel , " Patel said , " but I ' m a business man . I think she ' s being a little shortsighted . Most businesses can ' t survive alone in today ' s competitive economy . You need to get creative with the business models you enter and the staff positions you fill . A diverse workforce of independent contractors is sometimes a better way to go . Putting all of your eggs in one basket doesn ' t work in investing it doesn ' t work with relationships either . "
