As Mr Cowell so succinctly put it whilst wrapping up the press conference " The Romans threw people to the lions for public entertainment , and we were hanging children for stealing as recently as 150 years ago . The fact is people like to see others suffer and if they can point , throw things , take the piss and ultimately have a say in who lives or dies just based purely on whether they like the look of them or not , all the better . You can ' t stand in the way of progress , especially the progress of immoral sums of money into my offshore bank accounts " .
