Take a look at Tom Cruise , for instance . He was one of America ' s most beloved movie stars . Back in those days , had you suggested that Top Gun was gay , some of his admiring female fans might ' ve gone on the warpath . However Tom had some secrets , that his impending divorce from Nicole put in jeopardy . He over reacted , Hollywood style , by dating 1st Penny Cruz , and then Katie Holmes . If that wasn ' t enough , he did cartwheels on the Oprah show about the new and improved love of his life . People thought he was trying to hard , and things spiraled out of control from there . The more he picked at it , the worse the situation got . The Tom Cruise fiasco went from the bizarre to the ridiculous in no time flat , as Tom acted like he just couldn ' t help himself !
