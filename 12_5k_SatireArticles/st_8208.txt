" Whilst the grater is the only product on the market that can grate soup , " said Mettier , " we were unable to test it with every food stuff available . We think it might have been a cucumber , or possibly a brick , that somebody attempted to grate . We have tested it with bricks , and that shouldn ' t have caused the small thermonuclear explosions that we have been seeing . However , our brick was on it ' s own , whereas the reports suggest that the Dorking brick was still attached to the multi storey car park . "
