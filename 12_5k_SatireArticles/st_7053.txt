The findings of the report look set to cite the fast food corporation as the obvious choice as they already have premises with disabled access in most UK towns and cities . It is thought that disabled claimants will be sent to the window of their local McDonalds Drive Thru where a sullen teenager on the minimum wage will ask " Can I take your disabilities please ? " . The claimants medical conditions will then be input into a computer which will calculate which handouts they are entitled to , if any at all . Those found to have a legitimate claim will then be sent to a collection point where they can collect specially issued DWP vouchers which can only be exchanged for essentials such as bread , milk , clogs , shawls and sacks of coal .
