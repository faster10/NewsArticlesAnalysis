But it gets worse . If a charge could never be made to stick , then the Police would no longer have the function of gathering evidence for a trial and would become redundant . Their role of enforcing the law would become impossible due to its extreme complexity . With no evidence or information available for a trial , lawyers , judges and the whole legal system would no longer be required . With no convictions happening there would be no need for prisons . The whole legal , judicial , penal system would no longer have a function and would stagnate and collapse .
