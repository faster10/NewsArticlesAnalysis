The research is being heavily criticized by the Big Vegetable cartel . " They did not look at other complicating factors " said Red Green , spokesman for Carrots and Beets Unlimited . " For example , it appears that they did not make an effort to adjust the raw data for individuals ' fruit intake , and we already know that many if not all people who eat fruit will die . Worse , it was only a retrospective study , not a prospective study , so there was no opportunity for double blind testing . "
