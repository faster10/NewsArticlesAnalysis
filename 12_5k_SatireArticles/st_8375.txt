Rowdy put on a few pounds for the photo shoot . " I was slim and trim or , as I prefer to say , lean and mean , in preparation for my fight with Cat , " Rowdy confessed , " but Mr Fetchingbumm said he wanted someone with boobs , so I had some implants installed . I just hope the extra weight doesn ' t slow me down and give my opponent an advantage . Cat is a worthy opponent it ' s hard enough to beat her ass when I ' m at my fighting weight . Having hooters might be good for my image as a cover girl , but they could be a drawback in the ring . "
