McGregor , once feted as Britain ' s greatest living actor , has seen his credibility fall by the wayside as he took role after role in piss poor , half arsed films . attempting to excuse himself for " Black Hawk Down , " he stated that , " the chance to work with Ridley Scott was one that I had to jump at , " conveniently forgetting that Ridley Scott films are hardly as rare as rocking horse shit these days . When he tried to make the same claim for working with Woody Allen on Cassandra ' s Dream , the interviewer ' s laughter was so loud that it damaged the dictaphone recording the interview . In a moment of candid self analysis , McGregor said that there was no reason good enough on God ' s green Earth for working with Michael Bay .
