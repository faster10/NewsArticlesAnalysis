" For men , hair gel is associated with two things , " says Brandon Mills , a professor of psychology at Purdue University , " vanity and mistrustfulness . In the movies , the hero rarely has gel in his hair . Have you noticed that ? The villain often does . A real male hero has too many important matters to deal with to concern himself with his hair . Look at James Bond . Women go wild over him . He looks great , even after being chased and shot at , and his hair is never gelled , and it ' s certainly not tousled . Good looking , manly men just don ' t concern themselves with their hair . "
