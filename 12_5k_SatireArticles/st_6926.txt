" The DVD library will feature an extensive collection of movies produced during my eight years in the White House , " Clinton said , speaking to reporters in his Harlem office . " It will also provide the public with access to some classic re releases and a bunch of great newer films . Did you all see Lost In Translation ? Really beautiful movie . Some people said it was slow , but I thought it was perfect . I picked that one up at Best Buy earlier today . "
