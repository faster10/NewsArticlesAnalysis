" One shoe may not seem like a lot , but the lethal effect increases exponentially with the number thrown . " The senior U . S . commander in Iraq , General George W . Casey , notes chillingly that there are an estimated 26 million people wearing shoes in Iraq and millions more spare ones stockpiled in closets or under beds . However , he also clarifies that " our target is not the ordinary Iraqi who loves democracy and likes to wear shoes for lounging around the house or visiting the local market , but rather the fanatical terrorist minority who insists on throwing them at the genuine political leaders of Iraq in a fruitless attempt to stop the march forward of freedom .
