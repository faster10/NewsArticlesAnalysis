" Look , I don ' t know what the heck you ' re wittering on about . I ' m not the world ' s most evil man at all . You ' ve got it all wrong . I ' m just sitting here minding my own business , enjoying a quiet pint and picking some horses for an each way round robin . After I ' ve popped in the bookies , I ' ll probably treat myself to a nice fish and chips for my tea , and put my feet up for the evening . Now , would you please leave me in peace , and just go away . "
