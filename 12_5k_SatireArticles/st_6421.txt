Phil Mickelson , who provided dozens of highlights during the first round , looked relaxed and comfortable golfing in the gymnasium , guidance counselor ' s office , auditorium , and teachers ' lounge . The three time Masters winner pulled off a number of high risk shots , blasting the ball out of a dense pile of wires behind the stage on the third hole , sticking a six iron from 215 yards away to make birdie on the famed " Mr Martin ' s Band Room " hole , and finessing a miraculous punch shot from underneath a cafeteria table that helped him save par on the par four ninth .
