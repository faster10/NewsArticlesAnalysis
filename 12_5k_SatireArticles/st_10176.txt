Charlie Sheen was spotted watching the events from a makeshift canteen that had been set up to refresh the Freedom Fighters . When asked what his involvement was in the White House takeover , Sheen exclaimed , while enjoying a Corona and cheese fries " Do you really think that when I hear that thousands of people are going to storm the White House , many of them hotties with guns , I ' m going to stay home and watch Oprah ? And they ' re serving beer and munchies ? ! HEL LO ! " Sheen added " this is the best 4th of July ever ! "
