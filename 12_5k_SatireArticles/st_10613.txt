The decision to locate the trial to Governor ' s Island appears to be a compromise , as well as a face saver for the Attorney General , that could resolve many of the current objections . " Using Governor ' s Island for the forth coming trial makes sense , " says Council Speaker Christine C . Quinn . " First it will provide needed construction jobs to renovate the existing facilities . The size of the island and it ' s remoteness from the city make it an ideal space to secure . Furthermore , we have gotten agreement that access to the island will be by motor launch from Pier A in Jersey City making certain that there will be no traffic generated in lower Manhattan .
