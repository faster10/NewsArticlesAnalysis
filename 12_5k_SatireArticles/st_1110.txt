" I was like , ' How come you ' re not gonna see Audrey over break ? You ' ve got two weeks off , ' " Dwight said . " Tim said he couldn ' t fly there because his parents wouldn ' t let him travel over New Year ' s , with the whole Y2K thing and all . And he said Audrey couldn ' t come here because she didn ' t get any time off from school for Christmas , since they don ' t observe it in Canada . At least not in the French speaking parts like Alberta . "
