BBC , ITV , Channel 4 , Channel 5 , and Sky are now caught up in a bidding war for sole rights , but no one is in much doubt that Rupert Murdoch will prove to have the deepest pockets . ( They are in fact totally bottomless , which gives rise to speculation that Mr Murdoch may well be the biggest w nker on the planet . Ed ) . No doubt at a later date Channel " Dave " will pay handsomely to air the whole shebang as re runs . Unless of course somebody starts up Channel " Lightly Sauteed Shoe Leather " in the meanwhile .
