With no savings and only his Toyota Tercel , but still owning a nice home and business , George was undettered . He was back on Adams street the next night , where he met with even worse luck . It seemed like life was against him , he related . He took several girls back to his home in the course of the next week , but each one robbed him , and after the first two claims , his insurance dropped coverage on him . He did say that the only reason the second one was able to rob him was because ( and here George blushed a bit ) " she " was a man . " But she I mean , he hadn ' t looked like one . Actually , ' he ' was prettier then most of the others . Strange . "
