' I remember when shops sold items made of paper that you could write on , ' reminisced pensioner , Gladys Scribbler , a report contributor . ' We used to have writing paper and envelopes , and we had diaries in the form of little paper books , ' she nostalgically recalled . ' I don ' t understand Facebook , Twitter , email and electronic diaries , so I can ' t write to anyone , anymore . I used to like a good read too , ' she admitted , ' but I can ' t work a Kindle . I still go shopping , ' she added , ' but with all these complicated credit cards , debit cards and loyalty cards , how long will it be before I can ' t use money anymore ? I ' m worried I ' ll starve . '
