Club captain John Terry was most emphatic on his opinions regarding his Manager ' s possible future as an understudy at Anfield . " I think it ' d be a good career move , " the talismanic England defender said . " Jose is a good tactician , but there ' s a lot he can learn about man management , facial hair and the transfer market . I played FM07 , for instance , and I managed to sign Ribery , Kaka and Miroslav Klose before the 06 07 season even got underway . Would I like to become player manager of Chelski ? Sure , why not .
