The general idea behind Carma is that you let somebody in at a junction , or actually consider other drivers when coming to a stop near a junction so you don ' t block it . Drivers would stop at zebra crossings , and not dodge through amber lights . And in return , they build up Carma . Carma is spent when wanting to come out at a junction , or cross a road yourself . If you save up sufficient Carma , then a lottery win , or meeting the love of your life might befall you .
