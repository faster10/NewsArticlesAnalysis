" , The democrats on the other side of the aisle , suspecting this is the change the nation has been waiting for shout " IT ' S TUESDAY " . Taking turns shouting these phrases back and forth for hours , house leader Paul Ryan asked for a break in the action and for both sides to consider a compromise . After the break the republicans shouted ' IT ' S TUESDAY " and of course the Dems shouted " ITS WEDNESDAY ! "
