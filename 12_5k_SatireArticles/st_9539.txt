But most citizens of Potlandia defend their laws . " The drugs aren ' t the same at all , man , " says Sunny Moonwind , wearing a tie died shirt , bandana around her forehead , and bare feet .

But nicotine just makes you a more close minded worker bee , man . It makes you a slave to the machine . And who wants to be a slave when you can be free ? "
