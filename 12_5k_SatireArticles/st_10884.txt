New Delhi : The hitherto warm and fuzzy relationship between the two great democracies of India and the United States today took a turn for the worst after an attempt was made on the life of the visiting US President , George W Bush . According to unconfirmed reports received through even more obscure sources in the Pentagon we can now confirm that a dastardly attempt of a cowardly nature was made on the life of the President . This sad event occurred as George W Bush was innocently enjoying a game of local baseball ( also known as cricket ) at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground .
