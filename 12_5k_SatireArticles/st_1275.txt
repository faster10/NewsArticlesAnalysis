" Right now , I ' m only bathing Derek in a little bit of my healing light , and I ' m reserving the rest of it for later until I see how things go , " the Son of Man said amid sighs . " I honestly can ' t believe I have to walk alongside this guy for the rest of his days . Believe me , though , if he runs into adversity or temptation , there ' s no way I ' m carrying him or lifting the weight from his shoulders . That ' s up to him . "
