A new law which became effective today makes it compulsory for all Australian adults to consume more alcohol . All adult citizens must now drink at least two litres of alcohol per day . The quota can be made up through the consumption of alcohol drinks of the person ' s own choice . The legislation requires that the containers of all such drinks now show clearly the actual quantity , in millilitres , of alcohol contained in the drink so that the drinker is able to maintain an accurate record of his her consumption . Everyone is required to keep an account of their consumption for inspection by appointed inspectors . It is expected that everyone ' s consumption record will be inspected at least monthly . There will be penalties for under consumption and bonus points , which can be redeemed for useless popular gadgets , for exceeding the minimum requirement .
