Not much has been written about Monica for the last 20 years since she left the limelight or low light , as some have called it . However , in the last two years , Monica has reemerged into the public spotlight of her own choosing . She penned a major article for Vanity Fair magazine in June 2014 and was interviewed for a March 19 , 2015 , New York Times story entitled : " Monica Lewinsky Is Back , but This Time It ' s on Her Terms " . Some have speculated this was the beginning of her run for the White House in 2016 maybe her one last chance to finally stick it to Clintons , instead of the other way around .
