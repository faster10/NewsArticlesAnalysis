" I really needed an extra hand , but I didn ' t have a lot of money to pay Leah , " Pfaff said . " I didn ' t want to take advantage of her while she was in such a fragile emotional state , but Leah said the low pay was fine because she really loved the store . She told me , ' Sure , Mom and Dad wouldn ' t have approved of me working for peanuts , but we can ' t live in the past , can we ? ' "
