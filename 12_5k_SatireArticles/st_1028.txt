Shortly after the press conference , the White House announced that an advisory panel comprised of former officials from both Bush administrations and of private military contractors would be formed to devise effective solutions to problem areas in the nation ' s defense , namely the quality of the soldiers . Some of the likely recommendations include toughening recruitment standards so that not just anyone can enlist , and offering swift advancement opportunities for troops who show less dependence on the support current forces seem to constantly require from the American people . The panel is also expected to recommend that the nation enter into additional costly overseas conflicts as a way for the military to hone its combat skills .
