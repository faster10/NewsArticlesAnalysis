" Look at Mulan and Pocahontas , they are both historically accurate AND true to the material . Not to mention , isn ' t that enough diversity already ? Really , next thing you ' ll know , we ' ll have new Disney adaptations of a black Cinderella or an Asian Sleeping Beauty ! Honestly , who thinks up these type of things , the very thought ! Even though these Disney movies are set in fictional worlds where animals talk , trees sing , and witches exist , you still have to make the movie historically accurate ! " Exclaimed Mr D . Bagge .
