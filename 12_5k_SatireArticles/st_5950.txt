" With today ' s fully automatic homes , artificially sentient robotic cities , 32 lane automatic roadways , floating antigrav suspended skyscrapers , air conditioned city domes , and 96 inch personal fusion screen monitors , the energy demand of human civilization has never been higher . Why , last year , the wattage requirements of leisurebots alone exceeded the entire world ' s energy consumption rates of 1988 . It ' s no surprise that SOLOPEC can barely keep up . "
