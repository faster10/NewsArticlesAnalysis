" It was nowt to do with me , " said God , who turned out to be from Yorkshire . " Sounds like a daft idea , flooding the South . Why would I do that ? For me this gay marriage thing is just good business . Especially if they get married in church . More money in the coffers , int it ? This flooding things all yer own fault , what with all this global warming . That ' s not me , you see . It ' s you . Although , some of you might blame me , it ' s not me . "
