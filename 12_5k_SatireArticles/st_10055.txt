When asked about his foreign policies he replied on micro social media format that he would launch pre emptive raids against anyone he didn ' t like including those arrogant old crusties of the " old world " , Europe . We should have colonised it after WW2 , after all we saved it and their continued ungratefulness annoys me . " Rogue states would be nuked immediately someone informs me they exist , locating them is up to the Department of Geography as I am too important for small issues like who we nuke , nuke all of them then we will be safe " he stated . He also stated that " having all these nukes and not using them is bad for the economy " and " it would be a waste of American innovation to not use them before their expiry date " .
