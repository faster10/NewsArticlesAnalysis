Even the President ' s conservative detractors acknowledge the President ' s waffling skill . " I ' ve never seen anything like it he can do it on the fly and without any prompting , " noted Rush Limbaugh . Limbaugh has of late been focusing his talk show rants on the recent Libyan ( Benghazi ) debacle in which an American ambassador and three support personnel were murdered by a band of raving Islamic terrorists . There is speculation that the Ambassador may have been involved in passing American weapons to local al Quada agents during the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi , and that the terrorist group turned on the American when he was directed to try and extract the U . S . from that unseemly relationship . A relationship with potentially disastrous consequences for the President ' s re election bid .
