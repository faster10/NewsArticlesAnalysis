" Despite the fact that these occurrences are clearly delineated in the prophetic Biblical writings of John of Patmos , we have no reports at this time of any seven headed dragons , rapturous vanishings of the Elect , or armies of the Morningstar amassing under the leadership of the Antichrist and preparing to engage in final battle with the forces of righteousness , " said Oxford University professor Dr Thomas Lesser . " In fact , not only is there no seven headed dragon , but there appears to be no evidence of dragons of any sort , seven headed or not , in the East or anywhere else . "
