The WSJ reminds us that " no one likes a whiny designated driver who refuses to raise a glass of cheer to whatever ' hooey ' the boss is saying , so arrive at the party in the party spirit and suck that booze up ! Show them that you can pound a few back with the best of them . Everyone knows that behind every CEO is a woman who can hold her liquor . And don ' t make the mistake of drinking the ' girlie ' drinks with the little umbrellas in them . Drink like a man ! Tequila shots . And lots of them . " You go , girl and get that boy a raise !
