Yup them were the days . Cell phones were two cans attached with a string with a range of about 10 feet , everybody rode their bike everywhere , you never called any of your friends at home because you had said it all at school , or at baseball practice , and you were too busy doing your homework or doing chores around the house unless you were out in the garage modifying your bike with a few playing cards attached with clothes pins to the wheels for that authentic muffler sound .
