" I had the light , but I could have been paying better attention , " Obama said , a tear streaking down his face . " And that ' s what kills me , you know ? This was my fault . It was an accident but it was my fault . You take your eye off the road for a second , and bam , you hit Jimmy Carter with your car . I ' m actually sort of numb right now . Jimmy Carter is gone and I am the one responsible . "
