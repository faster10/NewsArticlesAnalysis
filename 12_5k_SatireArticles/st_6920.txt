" Basically , your web presence is an extension of who you are , " Allen added , later saying that the internet is a great place for building your personal brand . " For example , when you first get to my welcome screen , you click on a silhouette of my glasses to get to the home page , and then the nav bar appears above a big black and white headshot I scanned in . And I just made it so Benny Goodman ' s ' Roll Em ' plays in the background , too . I try to add as many of those little personal touches as I can , just to make myself stand out more . "
