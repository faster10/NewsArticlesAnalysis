" We keep meaning to get together for lunch and talk about everything , but the date has been pushed back a few times , " Paul said . " We call each other a couple times a week to see how things are going , if we ' re not too busy . But there ' s no way that the separation will work if we don ' t give each other a lot of space . Part of marriage is respecting your loved one ' s personal time . "
