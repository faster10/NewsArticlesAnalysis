Beverly Gliss Mason , a manicurist in Reynard , Idaho , says she plans to vote against President Obama in November because of what she calls his fecklessness on the issue . " My boyfriend last week tried to make a video of himself posing with a bunch of automatic weapons but , big surprise , thanks to Obama ' s incompetence the price of machine guns is going through the roof , and you know why ? Because Obama lets the guns pour into Mexico for cheap , so they can do all the killing they want . But my boyfriend , who ' s got a good job and all at the mini mart , can ' t fricken ' afford to buy a semi automatic weapon ? And that ' s just for his video ! What ' s he gonna do when it comes time to ' do it ? ' What is he supposed to do , go out there with a fricken ' BB gun ? You can ' t live a fantasy life with a BB gun . We need our guns to stay where they ' re made , and that ' s right here in the U . S . A . "
