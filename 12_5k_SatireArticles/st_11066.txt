" The girls and I are all totally sick of these fatties oozing their grossness all over our children at the child care centre . They ' re putting my child Parris ( with two Rs ) at risk , not only from potential suffocation if one of those heifers sits on my child , but also , our children are learning bad eating habits when they see others scoffing down cream buns at recess . If parents can ' t have more control over their children ' s eating then they really shouldn ' t be sending them to childcare or to school and exposing other children to risk . "
