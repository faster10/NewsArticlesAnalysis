" When I moved here in 1996 , we had some really crazy guys , " Allard said . " Every Friday night , when our R . A . would be out at his girlfriend ' s place , we ' d hold these huge , floor wide progressives . I lived with Mike , and our room would always be the Sex On The Beach room . You don ' t even want to know some of the shit that went down . These new guys , they ' re just not like that . I wouldn ' t want to party with them even if I was still into that whole scene . "
