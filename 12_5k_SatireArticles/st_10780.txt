Based on the John Maynard Keynes philosophy , it ' s important to understand that Keynes ' s theory was not an economic theory in the normal sense . It was not intended to develop human understanding of how markets operate . It was written , by a Government bureaucrat , to justify the desires of governments to spend profligately . It has wrought disaster . But those who are in Government will always find it attractive , in the same way that a bogus theory " proving " one ' s racial superiority will appeal to those who seek to dominate other peoples .
