On the topic of vaccination Mr Abbott said while he could not support a parent who had done their own research and come to an educated decision not to immunise their kids , he was , however , happy to allow them to refuse vaccination if they had a particular imaginary friend in the sky who denied you entry to an imaginary paradise after death if you immunise your kids , that was a fine and dandy reason not to vaccinate and if that same imaginary deity demanded your kids be porky then you get a religious exemption from the new obese kids legislation too .
