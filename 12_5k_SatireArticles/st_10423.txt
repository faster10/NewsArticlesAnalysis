White House spokesman Scott McClellan defended the Bush record on hit series , noting that while " CSI " may have premiered in the waning days of the Clinton presidency , the show didn ' t become a hit until Bush was elected . " I mean , come on , December 2000 , the Supreme Court stops the Florida recount . Two days later ' CSI ' hits 1 in the Nielsens , " said McClellan . " Then Bush Cheney gave us ' CSI : Miami . ' And if re elected , Americans can expect 4 more ' CSI ' series by 2008 . "
