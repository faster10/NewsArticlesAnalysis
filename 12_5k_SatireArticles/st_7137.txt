We sent our Pit Crew Chief , Rusty Muffler , down to the Drag Strip Capitol of the World in Gainesville , Florida for the press conference , where Hot Wheels CEO , Timmy Zoomer , had this to say about the new merger : " To us , it was a slam dunk a roni ! You take a boring old straight black track and paint it bright orange and put some fun flame strips down the edges , added a few loopity loops and a shark jumping feature and you ' ve got yourself a much more desirable product ! " said CEO Timmy , who went on to explain , that if his mom will let him , he can turn around the NHRA within a year , and have a profitable season by the time he finishes 6th Grade in three fiscal quarters .
