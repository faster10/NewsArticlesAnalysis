Said Watson , " I ' ve got to get our lads to loosen up a bit . Nothing like a few snorts to relax the muscles , relieve stress , and just let your natural ability and muscle memory take over . The biggest key after shot positioning , is the short game . . . . . you ' re better off being half in the bag . Relaxing the hands will more often then not put the ball in the cup . I ' ll be working on that with my boys prior to the next Ryder Cup . . . I ' ve asked Big John Daly to lend a hand , and we ' ll be having some conditioning work outs starting in about a month ! "
