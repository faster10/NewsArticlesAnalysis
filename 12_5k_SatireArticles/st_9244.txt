" I ' ve really , truly enjoyed the last five years . It ' s been a great ride , but I just feel that the best thing for me at the moment is a change , " said Bush . " I want to go back to my home in Texas , to spend more time with my family my twins Jenna and Barbara , my husband George and my great dogs , Mizz Beazley and Barney . You know , my husband is a busy man and he travels a lot , so I ' m looking forward to being able to spend more time with him now . "
