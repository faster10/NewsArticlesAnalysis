Senior Administration officials and supportive lawmakers pretty much validate what the President isn ' t saying publically by voicing their own anti gun agenda . The likes of Senators Finestein , Schumer , Durbin , Lautenberg , and Boxer keep the furvor alive and give their usual wink and nod to other supporters who desire to see the Second Amendment shredded and re written by those who desire a more ' progressive society , ' but want the President to throw his weight behind their efforts . Gun ownership and support for the Second Amendment is at an all time high with upwards of 82 of the American people supporting freer , less restrictive gun ownership rights . Obama knows this and will do anything to distance himself from the anti gun controversy in an election year . If he happens to be re elected the dogs will be unleashed with their usual anti gun slogans ' responsible gun ownership laws ' . ' common sense regulations ' . ' practical 2nd Amendment reviews ' ' child safety initiatives ' ' Police Protection legislation . ' ad naseum
