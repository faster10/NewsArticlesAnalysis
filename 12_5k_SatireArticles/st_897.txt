" I guess people were too busy enjoying themselves to get sentimental , " Roberts said . " I wasn ' t expecting sobs , but I don ' t think anyone even got misty . People gave me goodbye hugs , but they weren ' t ' we ' ll miss you ' type hugs . Twice , I was lifted off the ground and swung around in circles . It was nice to see such a strong outpouring of emotion , I guess , but I wasn ' t expecting so much whooping and hollering . "
