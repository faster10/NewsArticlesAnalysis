" In this day and age , too many truck owners try to pawn off responsibility to someone else , " Maurer said . " They just drop it off at the Jiffy Lube or Tires Plus and assume that ' s okay . But a mechanic is no substitute for an owner : If you don ' t actually put in the time with your own truck , how can you know what ' s really going on under the hood ? That ' s why I never miss any of the important events . I ' m there for every tire rotation , oil change , and radiator flush and fill , even if it means having to take time off from work . "
