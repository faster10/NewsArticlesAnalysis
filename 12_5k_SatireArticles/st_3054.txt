" Some people might say , ' What do I need a personal Gromdar for ? I ' m never going to use it , ' " Shanes said after one investor compared the Gromdar to the Blordash . " That ' s the same thing people once said about microwaves , but now we can ' t live without them . Mark my words , the people who are most skeptical of owning a Gromdar are going to be the ones who won ' t be able to put their Gromdars down , whether they ' re at home , in their office , or traveling .
