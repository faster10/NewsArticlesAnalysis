Many Red Sox fans believe the Curse of Curtis Leskanic was already broken this June when two diehard Red Sox fans traveled to Leskanic ' s childhood home in Homestead , PA and burned it to the ground , while others think the curse was lifted in August when the Red Sox won three games in a row . Still others believe that the ghost of Leskanic was expelled from Boston in April , when Jimmy Buffett played to a sold out crowd at Fenway Park Leskanic was known for not being that into Jimmy Buffett .
