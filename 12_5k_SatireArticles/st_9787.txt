The main lobby of the nursing home is named after Jerry Lee Lewis , a first year inductee , and has a large banner which reads " Whole Lotta Sittin ' Goin ' On . " Moving past the spacious lobby , visitors walk down a hallway named after Aretha Franklin , and R E S P E C T must be shown at all times there . From there , the place really opens up . Residents can hang out at the Rolling Stones ' casino , " Tumblin ' Dice " and if a resident loses too much at the roulette wheel , money can be obtained at the " Johnny Cash " ATM .
