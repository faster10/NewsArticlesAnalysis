" To be honest , there ' s some contradictory stuff in there , okay ? " God said . " So I can see how it could be pretty misleading . I admit it My bad . I did My best to inspire them , but a lot of imperfect human agents have misinterpreted My message over the millennia . Frankly , much of the material that got in there is dogmatic , doctrinal bullshit . I turn My head for a second and , suddenly , all this stuff about homosexuality gets into Leviticus , and everybody thinks it ' s God ' s will to kill gays . It absolutely drives Me up the wall . "
