" Slavery and History " will examine the fact that slavery was always an economic ( cheap labor ) or political ( subjugation of enemies ) issue and never about racism . It will also show that several biblical prophets , including Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , owned and sometimes had children with their slaves . This show will explain that all races and peoples were slaves at one time or another in the distant past and no one needs to feel guilty about the actions of their ancestors .
