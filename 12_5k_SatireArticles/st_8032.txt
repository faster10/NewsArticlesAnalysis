BOSTON , Mass . Remember that horrible Boston winter that had a blizzard effect all over the cable news networks ? Well it ' s still around . It ' s not snowing on the East Coast now that Memorial Day has come and gone , but the remnants of last winter stand as a stark messy memorial of the icy , snowy , mushy mess which was Boston ' s Winter From Hell 2014 15 . And this massive mountain of refuse , looking like a landfill dump that is trying to impersonate a skyscraper , is situated on a large parcel of land just off Tide Street . And in between all this junk is ice . Yes , ice , as in Brrrrrrr , that ' s cold . . There was just no place to put all that snow that came down over the winter . Cars were buried underneath it all and snowdrifts became as TALL as NBA basketball players as road crews frantically tried to find places to stockpile the white stuff . So mountains of snow and ice were warehoused in large land locked icebergs that took on the amorphous and monstrous shapes of warehouses in industrial parks in off the grid areas of the city . The worst was a 75 foot high pile just off Tide Street , which has shrunk to a more modest three story pile of dirt and trash , according to a Huff Post Weird News entry posted Friday ( May 29 ) . Many Bostonians are probably wishing the snow and ice were still there to cover over this ugly mass of trashy filthiness . An array of household items , bicycles , traffic cones , and even half a 5 bill that is still encased in solid ice like a dinosaur fossil , no doubt makes up the pile of rubbish , according to reports .
