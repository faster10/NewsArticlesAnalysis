Perry Beck ' s films have grossed more than a billion dollars worldwide and he is considered the most bankable black director in the industry , that is until now . One executive who greenlighted a Perry film , was asked how this might adversely affect black film making . The exec , who wished to remain anonymous , replied , " It won ' t . Hollywood is the most unoriginal place on earth . To keep the black audience , we will simply revamp old blaxploitation films . Just this morning I greenlighted remakes of Superfly , Blacula and Slaughter ' s Big Rip Off only with white actors Jason Mewes , Nick DiPaolo , and Michael Richards to fill those roles . Why cast white comics in those roles ? Because we think the idea of a black hero is a ridiculous notion to begin with . We just can ' t go back to making films about black guys beating up white guys . We see enough of that on HBO Boxing After Dark . "
