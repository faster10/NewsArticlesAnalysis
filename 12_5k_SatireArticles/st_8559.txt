In his closing statement , David reflected on his own " One Shining Moment , " and contrasted it to the ending of last night ' s game . " Listen , in all of this , one word pretty much sums this up : scoreboard , " said David . " Hayward couldn ' t even make that half court shot at the end , whereas I killed a NINE FOOT GIANT with a SLINGSHOT AND A PEBBLE . Have you ever done that ? Well I have , and it ' s much harder than making a half court shot . There ' s just no comparison . "
