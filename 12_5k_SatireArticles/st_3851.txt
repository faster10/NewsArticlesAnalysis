" Zero gravity , environmental adaptation , varmints . . . all these are unplanned things that surprise us when we take a step into space . But we aboard ISS Expedition 9 haven ' t met a problem too big for us yet , and we ' ll work this raccoon thing out sooner or later . Hopefully , before the clever little dickens figures out how to work the airlocks . "
