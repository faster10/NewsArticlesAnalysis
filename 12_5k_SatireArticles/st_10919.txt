' I could see the old three bells lightin ' up in ' is eyes and goin ' ding dong like . Says to ' im , I says I ' d be only too ' appy to sort out the framin ' , ' cause yer need someone who knows what they ' re doin ' when it comes t ' framin ' a picture I says . Tells ' im , I says mostly it ' s the frame that sells the picture anyway . They ' d need t ' be in decent frames , I says , and a decent frame don ' t come cheap , but they ' d more than pay for themselves by the price people will pay for a picture if it ' s in a nice frame . Stick ' em in a cheap frame and you ' d end up throwin ' ' em all away in yer dustbin I says . '
