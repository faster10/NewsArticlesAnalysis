Homosexuals , those who have children out of wedlock , those who even contemplate same sex marriage they should all be eligible for capital punishment . Labour supporters , the unemployed and those with long term disabilities they too should face the drop . Anybody who laughs at Eurovision or the Royal Variety Show , those who watch Channel Four . And then there ' s the French and Scientologists . I could go on . . . "
