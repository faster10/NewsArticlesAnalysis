According to a Justice Department spokesman , " The Department is taking these accusations very seriously . While the laws regulating just how aggressive lending companies can act in their efforts to collect a dept are very broad , the actual legality of physically killing individuals behind on their payments is rather vague . Congress and the Courts have consistently ruled that large financial institutions can do whatever they want whenever they want , but , the authority to just kill people for very little reason is a power normally reserved to the federal government .
