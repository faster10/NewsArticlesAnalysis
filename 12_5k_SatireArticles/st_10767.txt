" When asked why they gave her a live bomb and not a pseudo bomb , Knucklehead chuckled and responded : " Well , actually , she was supposed to get a pseudo bomb . She got a real bomb due to a rookie mistake . You see , we keep both live and pseudo bombs in our vans because , you just never know when you ' re going to need either one . We have white tags on the pseudo bombs and red tags on the live bombs . We have a saying : ' If it is white , it is alright , if it is red , then everyone is dead ' . Our rookie , agent Oversight , always gets the saying messed up and gave her a live bomb . But , that is not really important . What is important , is that we got a terrorist off of the streets " .
