" As many of you will know , our working relationships with the US space agency , NASA , have always been extremely close and collegial . NASA has graciously provided us with not only advice on the design of some of Beagle ' s systems such as the parachutes and heat shield , but also helped us with the development of the control software for the Beagle 2 landing system . And as we have stated ad nauseam , our budget has been extremely tight . Frankly we could not have afforded the time and expense involved in developing such software from scratch , so we jumped at the chance to share NASA ' s work in this area . "
