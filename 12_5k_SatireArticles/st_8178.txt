The " Institute for Demonic Science " ( IDS ) stated in its press release , " The a priori rejection of Demonic Possession by the Medical Community is an affront to all open minded people . The ' Germ Theory ' is only a theory and has never been proven . It is no more than a religion in itself , and must step aside to permit the inclusion of other theories of disease . The Bible describes diseases produced by Demonic Possession in over 40 places . No one has ever disproved these eyewitness accounts . Therefore , they must be included in medical school curricula . We have finally attained the fairness that democracy demands . "
