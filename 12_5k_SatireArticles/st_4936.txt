" I have to take my share of the blame , " said quarterback Tom Brady , who has already drawn moderate criticism this season for throwing only three touchdowns in each of the Patriots ' games so far . " With two minutes left in the fourth quarter , I missed tight end Kyle Brady in the end zone . Any other greatest quarterback makes that touchdown pass and we win by 24 not outstanding , but at least it would have given us some pride in the locker room . As it was , we couldn ' t look each other in the eye . "
