GOP loyalists contend " God ' s storm " served as the lightning rod that put the Christ back in Christie and turned the divine light on in the governor ' s head . The epiphany led the lord of lard to not only embrace the efforts of Obama , a big boo boo in the land of GOP poo poo , but he now believes that the people he serves are more important than the party he serves . That is heresy of the highest order on Planet GOP where billionaires like the Koch Brothers sit alone atop that lofty pedestal where there is no room for " nice guys " like Christie or God .
