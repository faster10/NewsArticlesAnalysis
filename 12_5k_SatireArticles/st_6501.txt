" TWA has spent over 400 million reconstructing this airplane piece by piece , all to ensure that you , our valued customer , enjoys the same comfort and safety on Flight 800 that you would on any other TWA jet , " Gorman said . " We ' ve literally scoured the bottom of the ocean to stock this plane with extra pillows , comfy headrests , GTE Airfones , and all the other conveniences it offered travelers the first time around . And first class passengers can look forward to lots of other recovered amenities , from a pieced together wet bar to extra wide , fully dried leather seats . "
