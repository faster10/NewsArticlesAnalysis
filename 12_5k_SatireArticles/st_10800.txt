ARIES Lucky people born under the sign of Aries will receive their checks first , before everyone else . That ' s because Aries is the first sign of the zodiac on the celestial wheel of life , Numero Uno , Top Dog , etc . etc . The government will adhere strictly to approved astrological procedures . No ifs , ands , or buts . Citizens who feel it is unfair for Aries recipients to be first in line for their check can call an " Astro Payment Complaint Hotline " but will find that they are on hold for long periods of time and will give up and go away .
