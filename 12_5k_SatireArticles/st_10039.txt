When MSNBC reporter , Chris Matthews , pointed out that his Puerto Rico rescue plan succeeded not by designed but by accident a clearly irate President Trump wanted to fire back . However , the fast talking Matthews jumped in and reminded the President that his plan involved mass deportation of Puerto Ricans , and of course all Puerto Ricans , whether they are born on the island or mainland , are U . S . citizens . In rapid fire and without taking a breath , Matthews explained Puerto Rican living stateside volunteered for free " deportation " by the hundreds of thousands just to get a free round way ticket to visit family and friends on the island . President Trump turned from orange to reddish when Matthews pointed out that Trump tried to stop the free " deportations " but the hotel and airline industry lobbied Congress to keep the program going for two more years and by that time the mass infusion of tourist dollars rescued the island .
