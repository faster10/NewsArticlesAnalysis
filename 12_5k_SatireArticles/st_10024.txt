Michael Forester ' s experience was one in the same , " I brought it home , unwrapped it for my son and set it up . Next thing I know it ' s telling him to draw a picture of Mexico on the floor in front of my walls with a crayon and the words " Build me ! Pointing at it ! I got Mexican neighbors man , we can ' t be having that around here . I took that ( EXPLETIVE ) outside and ran it over . "
