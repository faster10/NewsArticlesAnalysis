For a 25 admission fee , the campaign also plans to place a Trump statue wearing a Speedo in the center of a stadium and play Trump ' s stump speech repeatedly over a loud speaker . Individuals will be permitted to line up for photographs with the nearly naked statue , with extra donations required if you " sneak a peek " ( 12 . 50 ) and even more if you " touch and grab " ( 62 . 99 ) , both of which are , apparently , encouraged .
