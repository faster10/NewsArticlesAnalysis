" Nathan is an introverted , socially awkward young boy , and the other children at his home constantly prey on him because of this , " said guidance counselor Marlene Spencer , who noted that Nathan clearly dreads spending hours at home every day . " He ' s quiet and very shy , and unfortunately , the bigger kids in his house are all too happy to take advantage of his weakness . I really wish there was something I could do for him , but that ' s just how home can be sometimes . "
