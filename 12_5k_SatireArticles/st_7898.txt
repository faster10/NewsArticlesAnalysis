" It was bad , " said Buck . " But it was my feet that really caused my iPhone to melt . I mean literally melt . I wrote it down and everything . In hindsight , wearing training shoes twenty four hours a day was a bad idea . When I took them off I didn ' t really need the iPhone to tell me I smelled . However , I ' m a dedicated reviewer , and I ' m here to tell you that this app works , and it ' s worth five stars of anybody ' s review ! "
