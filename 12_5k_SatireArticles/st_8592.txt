" I ' m sure that my fellow athlete will be cleared of all charges " said a less talented , but just as , if not more , famous athlete . " We ' ve lived our entire lives with people supporting our every decision regardless of its practicality or logic . We ' re used to the double standard , and we deserve it , I mean think of how many people we entertain ! ? Do you really want your favorite team in that sport you like to be worse because of a silly mistake made by somebody who ' s been granted every feasible opportunity to avoid these exact kind of mistakes ? Honestly , a conviction would be nothing more then class warfare , if we let a really famous athlete pay his debt to society , then it just shows that we ' re not superior to everyone else . Do you want to have that talk with your children ? Do you want to be the person that tells them that being an athlete doesn ' t give you a free pass to get wasted and murder people with your car or bang anything that ' s likely to have a vagina ? I ' m not ready to stop destroying the true dreams and aspirations of my child by forcing him to follow in my footsteps . I didn ' t give a child my name with " Jr . " on the end so he could waste his time actually contributing to the solutions of our societies problems . "
