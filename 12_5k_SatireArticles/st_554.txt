" We can ' t let our soldiers feel like they ' re also facing an enemy on the homefront , " Strauss said . " They have enough to worry about without hearing that their own country isn ' t behind them . Could you imagine how demoralizing that would be ? It would be as traumatic as the time I had to give a speech on the Teapot Dome scandal at a school assembly , and Ricky Dorner kept whipping pennies at me the whole time . Ricky ' s a Marine now , and I heard his division got deployed to Tikrit , where they came under heavy fire from the Republican Guard . Haven ' t heard a casualty report yet . "
