The fight against irresponsible PSAs remains an uphill battle , but their opponents won a major victory with the California legislature ' s passage of " Brian ' s Law , " named after San Clemente teen Brian Kolterman , who was caught smoking a marijuana " doobie " by his mother in the family garage even though he ' d seen an anti drug PSA on TV earlier that same week . Under the terms of the new law , the creative heads of P . K . MacDreamer Imagineering Ltd . , the San Francisco ad agency which created the PSA that should have kept Kolterman off drugs , will be sentenced to a minimum of five years in prison .
