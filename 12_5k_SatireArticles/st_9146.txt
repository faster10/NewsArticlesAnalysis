In a stunning development yesterday , President Barack Obama has declined to grant clemency to Tom Turkey . The White House press secretary read a written statement which said in part , " I know this decision is going to make me unpopular , but there simply isn ' t enough evidence to warrant a stay of execution . If I granted Tom clemency , I ' d have to grant it to all the turkeys , and then where would Thanksgiving be ? Where would the turkey industry be ? To say nothing of the unfair favoritism I would be giving the tofurkey industry . And if I grant clemency to all the turkeys , how do I justify not pardoning all the pigs ? It ' s a political can of worms . "
