There was much rejoicing in the streets of Turkish cities after the news broke . Mel Gibson ' s " The Passion " has become an overnight hit in Turkey ' s movie theaters . One spectator commented after seeing the film : " We are proud to be new born Christians . We realize that we have a lot of catching up to do to achieve the same level of conscientious cleanliness and civilization as our European brothers . I personally have decided to enlist in the Crusades . For us it ' s Turkey today , Iraq and Syria tomorrow . " When reminded that there hadn ' t been any recruitment bureau of the crusades for about a thousand years now , the man said , " oh well , I guess I ' ll join the US Marines in Baghdad instead then . "
