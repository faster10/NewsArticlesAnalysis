But it was a scene at restaurant in Malibu earlier this month that has only now surfaced , that shows the exact nature of Victoria ' s fragile physical and mental health . Victoria was sitting outside on the terrace with her husband when a strong gust came in from the beach and she nearly blew away into the traffic , but was saved from certain death by a quick thinking waiter who grabbed her by her leg . The husband tied down his wife ' s legs to the chair so it couldn ' t happen again .
