The popular show spiked recent ratings to an all time high when newlyweds Prince William and his wife Kate visited the show for a two day guest appearance where ther Royal Couple hung out , ate pizza , drank Rolling Rock beer , and watched fellow cast member Vinny D ' Angelo pop zits and light beer farts . One particular scene shows Kate giggling when one potential flaming fart unexpectedly ( what Vinny calleed ' a wet one ' ) put out the match and stained Prince William ' s tennis shoe . The Prince declined to participate .
