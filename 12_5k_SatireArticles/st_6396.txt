" Name one absolute thing that makes one team a Super Bowl winner and the other a loser besides the score , " Colts fan Gary Lam said . " You can ' t . It ' s all relative . They both play in the same game for the same amount of time in the same sport after playing the same number of games . Any differences , such as how many times one team gets the ball to a certain area or propels it through the uprights , are relatively minor . Saying that scoring fewer points is what makes a loser is disingenuous . "
