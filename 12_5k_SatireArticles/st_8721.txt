Mr McNab is unconcerned by the allegations . Speaking from outside his rancid shop , he said , " Look , I ' ve been running this place for ten years and I ' ve never had a problem . All of the meat I use is hand picked by me from the local cats and dogs rescue home . I take it home and butcher it in my garden shed behind the shop . I even take measures to ensure the shed meets food hygiene standards by wiping the surfaces down with an oily rag and scraping the rust off my knives . I don ' t know what all the fuss is about . Doesn ' t everyone suffer from a dodgy gut and the shits after eating a kebab ? I know I do . "
