" I catch a few rays over the lunch hour if the sun ' s out , " Nielsen said . " Then , if I have a little time after work , I drive out to the lake and relax on the pier with a Diet Coke . And , of course , I sun a lot during the weekends at home and at the lakeshore . I make sure I ' m out there during peak hours . I don ' t burn easily , so sunscreen isn ' t really necessary . "
