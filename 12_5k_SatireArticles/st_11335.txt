Despite the novelty of the discovery , the western world is suffering from extensive ramifications from various social organizations , especially the VZEA or , The Vampire and Zombie Enthusiasts of America . Raymond Lofton , referred to by his peers as Vampiric Destiny , was kind enough to take a break from his FPSMMORPG ( First Person Shooter Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game ) to speak with us on the condition that the only light allowed into the room come from a pale computer screen , so as not to upset what he called " totally glazed over eyes " , and that Jerry , our news editor , continually press F6 to cast Bestial Howl for his level 79 Druid Warlock .
