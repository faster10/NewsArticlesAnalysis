The film ' s screenplay , co written with veteran film and television writer Lorenzo Semple Jr . , reportedly concerns a coalition of villains who form a " Batman Revenge Society . " The groups aims to murder Batman ( Christian Bale ) with , at various times , a plummeting steel safe , jets of cyanide gas concealed in a stuffed moose head , a trapdoor over a shark tank , a beautifully wrapped but ticking gift box , a gorilla trained to go berserk when it sees Batman , a sexy but ungrounded female robot , and a Rube Goldberg style contraption that , roughly 90 seconds after activation , propels a whirling buzz saw blade into the midsection of whoever is standing on a painted bull ' s eye target .
