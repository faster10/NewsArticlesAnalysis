Shortly thereafter , I win the lottery and retire to Montana to spend the rest of my long life enjoying my family and grandchildren . Because of my exceptional writing skills , I become the richest man on the earth . I use my wealth to create food , jobs , housing and health care for the poor of the earth . Wars stop .

At this point , all of the really bad evil has been removed from the earth . Life is good . . . . .
