The EPA ruling states that bathroom border walls are " microagressions " for some groups and " safety concerns " for others . The EPA has ruled that except in a medical emergency or for gay pregnant transgender crossdressing feminist handicapped African American Indian indigenous people of Hispanic descent possessing an unexpired license to practice Chinese traditional medicine while eating non GMO soy with solar power , that public bathrooms must have no walls . The only other exception is for public bathroom facilities in buildings with no running water and less than 20 square feet ( the outhouse exemption ) . It specifically removes the long standing rule to have a bathroom door automatically close , a safety hazard that kills hundreds of flies each decade . The ruling also identified the bathroom stall as " a prison cell " that must be removed to make way for a " free society . "
