Meanwhile , a tidal wave of criticism has been directed at Colin Aspin of the Blackpool Hotel Association , who has criticised the Government ' s decision . His remarks that the desertion of the government will " ruin our Autumn and early Winter season , and possibly bankrupt many of the town ' s businesses " has been met with condemnation . The Daily Mail has called Mr Aspin " the most selfish and evil man in Britain " for his neglect of the suffering millions abroad , and there have been calls to ban hoteliers in other towns from setting up similar associations in the future .
