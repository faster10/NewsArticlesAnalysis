The study was conducted by a crack team of researchers on temporary leave from their normal assignments at the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) of Britain ' s University of East Anglia . CRU leader Phil Jones said that their study demands attention of governments worldwide . " We need at least two billion pounds of funding to refine our work " he said . " At this early point in our research , we cannot tell if all vegetables have the same toxic effect , or whether some are worse than others . We are working hard on developing a computer model that will help us understand what is going on here , but we need funding . "
