" We ' ll do one shot for each and every victim of a handgun or an assault weapon until we ' ve tossed one back for every lost soul , " the Vice President promised . " Today , it is my pledge that , for every casualty , we ' ll celebrate at least one shot of Jack , and we ' ll keep doing shots of Jack until the citizens of America wake up and call their Congressmen to tell them we won ' t stop until they pass President Obama ' s and my bill .
