The Act defines TROs as the manufacture , purchase , sale , construction and or possession of any material , equipment or weapons that might be useful to a terrorist . Also included as TROs are such acts as support , supply and or defence of terrorists and terrorism and of anyone convicted of TROs , either before or after their conviction , in any situation . The lists are deliberately vague and open ended so that more offences can be added later and they can be interpreted widely . TROs will , on conviction carry a new range of punishments , the main one of which will be humiliation , as well as a life time prison term without parole . The Act also allows terrorists who are not available for trial due to their own acts of terrorism or for other reasons to be tried in absentia .
