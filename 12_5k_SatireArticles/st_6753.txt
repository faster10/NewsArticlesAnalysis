" For so long , we ' ve told people , ' If you weren ' t there , you wouldn ' t understand it , ' " Murphy said . " Well that ' s simply not true . If you weren ' t there , you could easily open up a book and get a very good sense of what it was like . There are plenty of books out there with detailed descriptions and vivid color pictures . You certainly didn ' t need to actually be there to get a feel for it . "
