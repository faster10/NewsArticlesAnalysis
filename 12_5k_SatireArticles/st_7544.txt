Jazz is made up of much more complicated chord progressions and chord structures . Jazz music is written in a form where the notes are not actually written down and instead chord charts are used . The jazz musician uses a technique called improvisation . Improvisation is actually spontaneous creativity whereas playing rock is done by rote which is a repetition by memory or the lowest form of skill as it applies to music . It has been proven that there is a definite link between mathematical concepts and music . Americans are terrible when it comes to math and science .
