Just as Marcel Espace Bar is young , virile , sexy , and efficient , there are also those typists who are not . As such , the final word must go to Oldie McBeentypingfordonkeysyears , the Scottish veteran of ninety one World Typing Championships , who has promised he will bow out of competitive typing after this year ' s tournament , at the ripe old age of 116 ( well maybe more putrid than ripe like a black banana ) . McBeentypingfordonkeysyears has never won the coveted Golden Typewriter but , with typical self delusion , still has not given up hope that this year might well be his year .
