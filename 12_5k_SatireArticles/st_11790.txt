Originally the Warringtons were invited to stay at their friend ' s cottage North of Orillia . However , as with all life , it was the journey , not the destination that would matter most , only in this case it was because the family never actually made their destination . After the trip to the end of highway 400 Northeast of Barrie took a day and half , the Warringtons calculated that they needed to turn around immediately to make it back in time for 6 year old Mandy ' s and 8 year old Jesse ' s bedtime Monday night , so they can wake up early the next morning to drive them both to school .
