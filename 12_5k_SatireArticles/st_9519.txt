They go bye bye and you wind up in a communist gulag with Pravda like propaganda on all the billboards , telling you everyone ' s happy , the nation ' s glorious meanwhile , the richest 10 control 75 of the nation ' s wealth and you ' re working for peanuts while pampered kids in China are enjoying your work for free on the internet . And what about the totalitarian rule of silence in the library ? Shush me , indeed ! "
