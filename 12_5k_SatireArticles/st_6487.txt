" In all , we had to pick up about 20 cartons for people , " Hagen said . " About half of them were for my brother Troy , who sounded like he ' d won the lottery when we told him about it . And we picked up a couple more cartons each for ourselves . Thank God for credit cards , because we only had about 50 on us . It would ' ve been a real shame if we hadn ' t had enough money to buy all the cigarettes we wanted . "
