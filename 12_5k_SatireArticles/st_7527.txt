The Premier Inn manager , Cuthbert Wancstane said that they ' d had a number of complaints from other guests about noise from Sven ' s room . " They said it sounded like he was being beaten with a roll mop or some other pickled aquatic creature . She squeals like a pig apparently , but I have n ' t heard them myself . It ' s a bit noisy up in that roof space , my head is right next to the hot water pipe and I have to keep that hole small , otherwise they ' ll see the reflection from the fisheye lense . "
