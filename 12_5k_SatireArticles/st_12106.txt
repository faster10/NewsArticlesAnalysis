Near the back he spotted the high school principal , Elmer Chickabiddy . He smiled to himself as he thought back to the juicy bit of gossip he recently learned about from Bobby Ray Wilson , a carpenter who ' s been building the new ladies room over at the high school . Seems old Elmer substituted the regular mirror with a one way mirror glass one weekend when the construction crew wasn ' t working . Bobby Ray happened to catch it when he found the old box and packing material in the dumpster . Jeb thought to himself that old Elmer was probably going to soon repent ' big time , probably to the tune of about two grand or more to keep that sinful thing quiet !
