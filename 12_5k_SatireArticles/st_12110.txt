The Autumn Equinox has long been associated with the time of harvest and food , that pre Christian religions celebrated with an orgy of celebrations and bon fires . Generally referred to as the Mabon A time of harvest , latter references in Christian literature of the Dark Ages called it Halloween , ( or the Samhain Sabbat from Celtic origins ) . Thus , the story behind the term itself , which is short for " the eve before All Hallows ' Day , " the latter referring to the fact that saints of Christianity were " hallowed " individuals . It is thought that the Church decided All Saints ' Day should fall on November 1 to make it coincide with its precursor , a Celtic festival of the harvest . By " overwriting " the pagan origins of Halloween , perhaps the new religion could steal some thunder from the lingering Celtic influence in Europe .
