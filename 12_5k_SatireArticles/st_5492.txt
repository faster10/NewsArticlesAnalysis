Labor Secretary Thomas Perez claimed the department ' s previous efforts , including unemployment benefits and occupational training programs , had failed to significantly improve the nation ' s job market over the past six years , and stated that their new yogurt based initiative was , at this point , the best way to help those who remain out of work . Perez , who repeatedly stressed that the plan was " worth a try , " said his agency will disburse yogurt dispensers , cash register scales , small tasting spoons , and vacant storefront and mall kiosk locations to millions of jobless Americans in the hope that selling frozen yogurt will finally help them earn a steady paycheck .
