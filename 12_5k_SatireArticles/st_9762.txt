And Fuggles ' furious owner , Fick , swears that Fuggles ' foul change in mood all stems from a recent run in with the local kennel , " The Puss and Pooch Motel , " after the kennel decided to deny Fuggles ' service under the new law allowing businesses to discriminate on religious beliefs . " The drop off was going perfectly normal , " squealed a spastic Mr Fick , who had used this particular kennel service several times in the past . " And then , after I told them that Fuggles had just gone through a really bad online break up , in a gay cat chatroom , and shouldn ' t be put in with other men cats right now well , boy , they looked right into Fuggles ' little cat mascaraed eyes , and pointed him straight towards the door ! " sobbed Fick . " It was a catastrophe ! "
