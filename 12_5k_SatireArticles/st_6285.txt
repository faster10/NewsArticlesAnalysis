" We challenge the Arnotts to get serious about the vital role they play in shaping America ' s culture , " said U . S . Rep . Steve Largent ( R OK ) , who has proposed legislation requiring warning labels on non family friendly families . " Look at the Petersons right next door . With their regular attendance at church , frequent family outings to Chuck E . Cheese ' s , and weekly Sunday night Scrabble games , the Petersons are the sort of wholesome , socially redemptive family this country needs more of . Why must we put up with this vile Arnott filth when there are such wonderful alternatives literally right next door ? "
