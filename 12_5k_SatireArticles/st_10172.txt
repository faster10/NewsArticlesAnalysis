The well organized , well armed Ron Paul supporters , known as American Freedom Fighters , descended on the White House , driving red white and blue painted SUVs and pickup trucks which they used to crash through barricades , followed by sports cars , sedans , motorcycles , bicycles and riders on horseback . Several helicopters overhead provide reconnaissance , one of which contained syndicated columnist and former Republican Presidential candidate Pat Buchanan , and radio personality Jan Mickelson . Mickelson has bravely covered Ron Paul on his show , in defiance of the media blackout .
