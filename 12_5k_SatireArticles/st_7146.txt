Shark is a big kid for his age . Wiry looking and lean , like his Uncle Jacko , who ' s over 6 foot five . Shark ' s got a shaggy dog haircut and a skull crossbones tattoo on the side of his neck . His Ma and Pa , Molly and Motor Man Mike , grounded Shark for a month after he showed up at home with that thing , which looked like it was etched on Shark ' s neck by using a sewing needle and blackish blue ink from a ballpoint pen . When Shark smoked all his mother ' s cigarettes one day , his parents lifted the sanctions and now , I guess , Shark can do whatever Shark wants to do which really is practically anything .
