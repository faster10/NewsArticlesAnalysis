In a paper published this week in Geophysical Research Letters , researchers from Brown University say they ' ve been studying how Pluto ' s surface expands , but it does not contract . This is evidence that there might be water underneath the surface of Pluto , which was demoted from being the ninth planet in our Solar System to a " dwarf planet " in 2006 . Pluto is such a lightweight , in fact , that its small size surprised the scientific community who predicted it would be as large as Jupiter right after Pluto was discovered on Feb . 18 , 1930 , by Clyde Tombaugh of the Lowell Observatory . The moons in our Solar System such as Ganymede , Titan , Callisto , Io , Europa , Triton , and the Earth ' s moon are all larger than Pluto . Pluto has 66 of our Moon ' s diameter and just 18 of its mass . So if you find yourself naked and shivering on Pluto , just thank your lucky stars you ' re not on a Hot Jupiter exoplanet 700 light years from our sun . And if you get homesick , the chance is pretty much nil of you ever returning to Earth . So , so long , cowboy !
