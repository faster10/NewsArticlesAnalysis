First Inning Thanks to genetic engineering , a total lack of morality and a TON of cash , the NY Yankees announced a new partnership today with ReverseDeath Industries , who together have bought the DNA of the entire baseball Hall of Fame and will begin " reanimating " the pantheon of baseball immortals and signing them to long term contracts . As if fielding a team of current All Stars wasn ' t enough , the Yankees will soon be able to call upon a roster of Ty Cobb , Honus Wagner and , of course , Babe Ruth himself .
