" I was going to mail the week before last , knowing how incredibly slow the post office can be , " Tobler told her friend . " I planned to drop it in the mailbox across the street from my optometrist ' s office when I picked up my new glasses . See , I didn ' t want those incompetents who collect the mail in my office to get a chance to lose it . But then I was in a rush to get my car ' s oil changed , so I didn ' t . But then my mechanic told me I needed to replace my brakes immediately , and that I ' d better leave my car there . By the time I got home in the cab , I realized I ' d forgotten your card in the glove compartment . I was so mad at myself ! "
