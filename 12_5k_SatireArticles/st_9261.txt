" Unless something is done quickly we ' ll be seeing many airlines going out of business within a week , " warned one airline spokesman . He said , " At the moment many of the planes are taking off and landing with just one or two clothed passengers on them with the rest of the seats empty . On one of our flights today we had just one elderly clothed passenger on the jumbo jet who even then had the audacity to complain when the pilot wanted to wear his cap ! "
