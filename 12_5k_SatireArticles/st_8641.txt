" You see its not just about the ability of the player to adapt to and understand my style of playing . He also needs to have the right attitude . For instance , I cannot spend money on players who want to come to Arsenal to win trophies . That is out of the question . That is why I sign a lot of teenagers because they do not yet have a sense of success with trophies . I get to groom them to stay that way so that they stick around when they become star players . But nowadays , they somehow get to know about winning trophies and want to leave the club . "
