Jimmy McClure was driving south on Highway 41 in central Georgia last Friday and had to pull off the road near a wooded area to relieve himself because there were no public restrooms in the area . He noticed an abandoned exit along the road which was covered by a dense layer of undergrowth and decided to investigate . He noticed that once he moved about 30 yards west that the road was still in a usable condition . He went back and drove his four wheel drive pick up truck past the vegetation that hid the road and found himself headed directly into the history books .
