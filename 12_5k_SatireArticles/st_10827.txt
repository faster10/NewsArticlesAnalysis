Our welcome to Crawdad was no better than our journey . Lyin George ' s henchmen were everywhere . We went into the Vicente Fox Gambling hall for a drink and some information . The place was full of Mexicans , few could speak English and were obviously outlaws from across the border . The bar tender , Hootin ' Hana , told us that the wetbacks felt right at home under the protection of Lyin George . Ticklish Terry who is stickler for standard consciousness and political correctness told her to be careful , wetbacks is a word that grabs the attention of the thought police and she better be careful . Hootin ' Hana gave him a dangerous smile and said , " I ' ll ignore this . " and Terry shut up . I began asking questions about Lyin George ' s spread and was answered with a loud silence . I turned around and their stood Rummy Dumsfield and behind him stood a company of wicked looking Army Rangers with lock and loaded M16s pointed at me . It took a moment for me to collect my thoughts before I said , " Don ' t you ever fight your own battles ? " He gave me that tight smile and said , " Your on dangerous ground stranger . "
