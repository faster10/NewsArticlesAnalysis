When asked to explain how she escaped , Daisy weaved an intricate tale of intrigue and deception . " First , we rode that rocket all the way to the desert . But then , on a hairpin turn , the coyote lost control and we went right over a cliff . We were in mid air , floating . The coyote made a huge mistake and looked down . I mean , everybody knows you don ' t look down if you run off a cliff ! But this coyote was like , stupid or something . So he lets me go and starts scrambling back towards the road , but by then it was too late . He fell a long ways while I strolled back to the road . I heard a small ' poof ' a few seconds later . "
