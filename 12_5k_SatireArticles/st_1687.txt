" I haven ' t seen anything like it in my 13 years on the force , and only a few things like it since high school , " said Detective Jim McClancy , one of the first officers on the scene . " Pairs of people were lying on the grass , on park benches , sitting on the curb , everywhere . They were giggling , murmuring sweet nothings . . . some were even moaning a little . I felt so . . . helpless we knew the shooter was still in the park somewhere . I ' ll never forget how my heart almost stopped when my partner Julio , a guy I ' ve served with for half my career , turned to me and said , ' Do you feel like getting some Chinese ? ' "
