" The U . S . government has been in the business of pandering to the private prison lobbies to provide them with a steady supply of inmates through prohibiting possession and sale of video games , " said Sen . Ben Sanderson ( I VT ) , one of the supporters of the legalization movement in Congress . " The government has no right to tell you not to enjoy an occasional video game on the weekend . And it certainly should not be incarcerating you for doing so . " Recent developments have re ignited the debate over the morality of legalizing video games . Many parental organizations are concerned that more and more children will have access to video games . They worry over the consequences of exposure to such forms of entertainment before adulthood .
