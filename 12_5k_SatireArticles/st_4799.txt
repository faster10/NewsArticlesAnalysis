" In 1989 , Americans were exposed to 1 . 8 reports on obesity each week and were an average of five pounds overweight , " study director Marilyn Fleder said . " Today , the average American is nearly 10 pounds overweight and sees or reads at least four reports on the obesity epidemic each week . If the trend continues unchecked , Americans will weigh 17 pounds more , and network news shows will devote a daily minimum of three minutes of airtime to obesity issues by 2010 . "
