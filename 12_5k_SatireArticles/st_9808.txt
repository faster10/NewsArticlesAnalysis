Then , it was on to the cafeteria . " Right over there , I remember being the target of a giant game of ' keep away ' , where about fifteen kids all threw my meatball sandwich around until I went and got the principal to get them to give it back to me . Needless to say , it was barely edible . But I persevered that day too . . . and ate that soggy , messy footlong sandwich , vowing right at that table over there in the far corner , to be the Governor of this great state . And those fifteen kids are all still in jail today ! So I won , again . "
