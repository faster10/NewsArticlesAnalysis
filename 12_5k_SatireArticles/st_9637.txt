One other unifying ' O . S . O . ' idea President Bush mentioned was to add some more color to the American flag . He felt that " the three colors we use represent the old America , ' red for the Indians , white for everyone else who got here early and blue for the sky or some reason or another ' and were out of date .

The President then asked for anyone at the meeting with children to have their kids draw up some ideas .
