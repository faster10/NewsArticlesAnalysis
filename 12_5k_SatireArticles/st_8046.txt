Next , Steele shows me a glowing plastic sword emblazoned with " Disney " on the hilt . " I ' m really proud of our design team for coming up with the Star Wars EMPeror Light Saber for kids and adults of all ages . The parental controls give you an adjustable range of four inches to four feet . For an added element of fun and danger , you can switch it to competition mode : that turns off it ' s internal shielding around the handle and it ' s then susceptible to damage from another EMPeror .
