" Asking how the customer is doing creates a ' personal touch ' that makes it more difficult and awkward for the person being called to hang up it ' s that simple , " CMER director Rupert Wardley said . " These people are not , as their employers would have you believe , actually interested in how the weather is where you are , or how your day is going , or any of the other conversational niceties with which they pepper their remarks upon initiating a telephone relationship with a potential customer . No matter how nice they seem , the fact remains that to them , the whole conversation is nothing more than a job . And it ' s a job with only one end goal to make the sale . "
