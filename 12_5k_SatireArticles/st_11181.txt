And , after Moses descended the mount carrying aloft the tablet of the Ten Commandments , Ishmael didst raise up courage and comest onto the flaming bush for a closer look . " Bush . . . what hast thee all hot and bothered ? Bushes don ' t burn at night . . . unless they be Roman bushes set alight for carousing and gambling . Art thou a gambling bush and hast thou fleeced our leader ? Hath Moses gone down the mountain with a beaten docket ? And why is he carrying the tablet above his head when it is night and he can ' t be seen for miles ? Or do these flaming leaves give hint of an orgy that Aaron is very probably planning right now ? And can ye throw some light on this strange word " dollar " that keeps popping into my head amidst much wailing and lamentations ? Moreover , thine timing is out of whack Oh Lord . You and Moses have got to stop meeting like this . " " Thou hast stuffed up , Ismael ! " sayeth the bush . " Thou hast gate crashed onto Mine Glory and hast discerned my style of delivery . Hence , thou must forevermore takest onto thyself and thine kin the name " Bush " . Got it ? And I am not making this up . " " " Verily Lord , in view of the fact that thine voice hath rattled the trees betwixt here and Rome and thou hath stirred into life my constipated bowels . . . soeth be it , " said Ishmael . ' Thus am I pleased , " sayeth the Lord onto Ishmael . " Now , piss off before I smite thee sideways . "
