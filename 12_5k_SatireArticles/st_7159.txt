During an interview , we spoke with Rhoda Horsey , one of the founders of the local chapter of PETA , located in Lizard Lick , NC who stated , " You ' d think they would learn after all the commotion over the Geico Lizard commercials " . " It is just horrible to think about how they exploit that poor lizard " . One of Rhoda Horsey ' s supervisors , Ms . M . T . Head , was quoted as saying " We made Geico change their commercial , we presented several petitions to the company requesting that they refrain from using animals in their commercials , they had no choice but to listen and finally they capitulated by taking that commercial off the air and replacing it with cave men , a much more appropriate choice " .
