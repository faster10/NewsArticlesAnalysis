Loopy BocaGrande , spokesperson for the F . O . O . L . S . , stated that earlier that day Griff Jenkins of Fox News had confronted their grand leader , the wannabe American Indian and former university professor , Ward Churchill , before he was going to address their organization . She said Churchill pulled out a plastic tomahawk that he carries around to make him appear Native American and attacked Jenkins as he persisted to ask Churchill questions . BocaGrande said she could not see what happened to Jenkins after that because other F . O . O . L . S . had descended on Jenkins and she could not see him as he was swallowed up by the crowd .
