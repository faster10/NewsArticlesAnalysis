Culverstone says he ' s convinced Romney lost to Barack Obama because of his use of hair gel . " I actually recommended to Mitt that he stop putting gel in his hair , but he is set in his ways and wouldn ' t consider it . But I think one of the reasons many people never really warmed to him , even many Republicans , was because his use of hair gel made him seem slightly less trustworthy than Obama , who , of course , doesn ' t wear his hair long enough to make the use of gel an issue . Ronald Reagan is an exception to this , of course , but he was older , from a generation that grew up on hair grease , plus he was an actor , so people already understood that he was just playing a role to some extent .
