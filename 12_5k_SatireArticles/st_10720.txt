" Government regulation is making it nearly impossible for lending institutions to maximize their investments . It ' s hard to believe , but in almost every state now , you actually have to prove that your bank owns the property your trying to repossess . Until recently that was an easy problem to fix , but thanks to the liberal media , Courts are actually requiring that any legal documents you produce must be real . This is insane ! How are we supposed to make any money when we have to prove that it is actually owed to us ? A simple foreclosure that used to take just a few days will now take months , even years to complete . When you look at the facts you can plainly see that the only legal solution available to us is to just hire some guys to go in and kill everyone who lives in a house . When the home owner is dead , the foreclosure process speeds up drastically which enables us to bring the returns our investors have come to expect . "
