Jose is still convinced he has a French shaped hole in his midfield . Schneiderlein is not the man to fill it and Pogba will not be joining unless United and Juve can agree who is to pay his agent something in the region of 25m . Actually , my money is on Ed Woodward to fold first and pay him 30m for the inconvenience . Still , if the obvious does not happen and Pogba remains in Italy then Jose will be looking to add Blaise to his squad , meaning that idiots like me can start working on Blaisin Squad gags .
