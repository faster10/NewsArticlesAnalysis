Jethro , a British comedian from the West Country town of Cornwall , is well known for his character comedy and his individual style of timing and delivery . Jethro ' s routine consists of character based stories , and he is notorious for telling impolite and crude jokes . It is believed that since Bond fans were left disappointment by the last Bond film in 2002 , Die Another Day , that producers Michael G . Wilson and Barbara Broccoli were looking to create a more traditional Bond film based on Ian Fleming ' s character . This fabricates the rumours that Wilson and Broccoli are looking to cast a new British actor to hark back to George Lazenby ' s classic portrayal of the British spy .
