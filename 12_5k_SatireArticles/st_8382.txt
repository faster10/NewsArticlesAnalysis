Jordan ' s course is said to be going up at record speed too , with bulldozers being chased by rolling green sods . " Yeah , he ' s really up my ass to get it done quick ! " said a sweaty Jack Nicklaus , who was personally digging out a giant sand bunker on the 12th hole . " But he ' s a really great guy . He ' s going to be really great for the game of golf . He ' ll probably win a Congressional Medal of Honor as well one day , like I did . I just really think he should rethink those seat belts ! "
