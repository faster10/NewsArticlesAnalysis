" Gerrard and Terry didn ' t deny that they knew ' Juicy Jeni ' " he later stated . " But then they couldn ' t have because I didn ' t see them . Come to think of it , I didn ' t see any other Premiership footballers either . I did see some mad old woman pushing a shopping trolley and wearing about a dozen coats . But other than that it was a complete waste of time . I hate that London . Full of nutters it is . Some of the silly buggers wear pork pie hats or fedoras . Too bloody weird for my liking . "
