Recognizing the unique contribution that Hitler and the Third Reich have made to the Entertainment Industry , Producers and Screenwriters alike are expressing appreciation for the ready availability of villains for the Motion Picture Industry . Steven Spielberg , speaking from the set of his latest movie , commented , " It ' s so difficult to write and cast bad guys these days . Everyone is just so horribly oversensitive about perceived stereotypes , and if you ' re not careful , you ' ve got boycotts and lawsuits from advocacy groups all over the place . However , nobody bothers to try and stick up for the Nazis . You can make them as nasty and obnoxious as you like , and audiences just love it ! "
