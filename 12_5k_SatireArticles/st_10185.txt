Not to be outdone by the City dog catcher , the Chiefs of the Police Department and Fire Department have decided to jump on the bandwagon . Chief Brattown just sent out a press release stating that they will not respond to domestic violence calls on the weekends , at night or on holidays . Instead he will direct 911 operators to tell callers to go to their website to read articles about positive domestic relationships . He will also give them the email address of Ann Landers so they can send her an email asking her for relationship advice .
