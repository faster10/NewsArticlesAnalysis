" Yesterday I passed him in the hallway and he asked me , ' Still work here ? ' Three words . That ' s all it took , " said sales agent Tim Kalpakis , who mentioned that every time he begins a conversation with Douglas , he comes out of it feeling worse about himself than before . " Sometimes he ' ll look at what I ' m working on and just quietly say ' huh , ' almost to himself . That ' s enough to make me feel awful for the rest of the week . The economy of phrasing is masterful . Truly masterful . "
