Outspoken Hollywood Indian Princess Cher , who has been vocal in her support of Warren said , " I resent being put on the ' Red List ' by some constipated Brit ! It ' s an insult to my heritage , my transgender son daughter , and most of all to the off spring of Jay Silver Heels ! ( Tonto to those of you in the Falklands ) . As for Elizabeth , of course she ' s part Indian just look at the beads she wears and those Jimmy Choo moccasins ! She was also known as an ' Indian Giver ' in college and always made a point of attending Winter Carnival at Dartmouth with all those other sex starved Indians ! "
