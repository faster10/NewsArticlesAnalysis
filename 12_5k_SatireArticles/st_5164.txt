" Don ' t get me wrong this year ' s Super Bowl was an exciting face off , " said Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid , whose team was defeated 24 21 in a hard fought contest . " The Patriots only got 331 yards on our defense , mostly because it took us a while to adjust to tackling players doused in Axe Deodorant Bodyspray For Men . But you can be sure they felt the heat of our Ford Motor Company sponsored Lincoln Mark LT blitzes . Our nose tackle drove this season ' s hottest new luxury truck straight into their offensive line . "
