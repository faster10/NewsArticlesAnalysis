" There ' s no place in college football for that , " Kelly said . " This Boise State is a heckuva football team . It shouldn ' t be marred by something after the fact . They beat us , and to react poorly after the game is not what we ' re all about . I just told the kids in the locker room that we have to learn how to play with emotion , not let emotion play with us . When you go out and get beat in a football game , you go out and shake that guy ' s hand and you go in the locker room and prepare for your next opponent . That stuff has no place in our program and won ' t have any place in our program . "
