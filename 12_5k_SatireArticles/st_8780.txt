What year is it ? 2014 yes , but in China it is the year of the horse . Naming a year after an animal might seem ridiculous to us but it has been tradition there for centuries . So has eating the penis of endangered big cats and snorting crushed ivory cut from the faces of very nearly extinct pachyderms , but each to their own i say . Very often they christen their children with animal names too and it seems like this has caught on in the West also . There are many examples of it and it is done for a variety of reasons .
