" The bile churns within me , I am so outraged , " Hanani said . " I go to the ticket counter , and the females wearing men ' s clothing tell me , ' We can put you on standby and try to get you on a 4 p . m . flight . ' Why do they say this word , ' try ' ? I did not buy a ticket for a 4 p . m . flight . I buy a ticket for a 8 : 35 a . m . flight . "
