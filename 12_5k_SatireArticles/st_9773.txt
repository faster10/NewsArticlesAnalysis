Mrs Voortface is best known , however , as the writer of the song , " Girls in Quiet White Dresses . " In what was Larry King ' s very first interview , she spoke about the genesis of the tune : " Now , I love raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens especially whiskers on kittens , but , Larry , think about the message that old song conveys : doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles ? Think about what it ' s advocating . Have you ever heard the shrill ruffle that satin sashes make ? And the banging of copper kettles ? The piercing crinkle of brown paper packages when they ' re rustled ? The maddening cackle of wild geese ? I don ' t have to tell you that cream colored ponies emit all sorts of ungodly sounds ! No , I just had to take a stand and counter that melody , for the sake of the culture . So , ya know , I wrote my song and then I didn ' t feel so bad "
