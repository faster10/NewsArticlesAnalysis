Dr Zuhdi Jasser , a devout Muslim and the Founder and President of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy said , " The leaders of this event Jibril Hough and Imam Siraj Wahhaj are not moderates . They are radicals . These individuals embrace Islamist supremacy and have demonstrated support for radical ideologies . A quick Google search by the DNC would have shown them that Hough and Wahhaj are leaders in the separatist American Islamist movement . While they may be able to get a few thousand Muslims to attend the event , they are NOT going to be mainstream Muslims . Most will likely come from Hough and Wahhaj ' s radical networks that have long been entrenched in the Charlotte area . Make no mistake they are part of the Islamist movement . "
