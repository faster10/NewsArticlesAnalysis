The legal battle for gay rights began in 1972 , when a Manhattan court granted homosexual couples the right to stand next to each other in public places " as long as they don ' t make a big deal about it . " In 1981 , 1983 , and 1986 , similar rulings in Boston , Chicago , and San Francisco granted gays the right to attend movies , take walks , and tickle each other while cooking dinner together . Monday ' s ruling represents the first time that homosexuals ' legal right to openly act " as gay as gay can possibly get " has been affirmed by the courts .
