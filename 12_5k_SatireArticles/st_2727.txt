" Sophomore Chad Shelby definitely has the goods to be a wide receiver , and I ' m really pushing for him to go out for track next spring , too , " Malanga said . " Freshman Kim Kause has got the same hustle that made her brother Mike the best point guard in THS basketball history . Very excited about her . And freshman Kurt Winters is a natural born wrestler . Can ' t wait to see what he can do with another 15 pounds of muscle on that frame . If that happens , we could be going all the way to State next year . He ' s that good . "
