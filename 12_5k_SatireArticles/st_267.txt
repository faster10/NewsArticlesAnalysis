" Will we miss football ? Of course we will , " said NFL Players Association president Kevin Mawae , who confirmed that professional football players would join all other pro athletes in turning in their uniforms and shredding their playbooks by May 1 . " It ' s all most of us know . But for a long time now , there ' s been a feeling that football wasn ' t worth playing as long as Skip Bayless was able to take these ridiculously adversarial devil ' s advocate stances purely to rile up viewers and get attention . It ' s better this way . "
