War and Peace opens in the Russian city of St . Petersburg in 1805 , as Napoleon ' s conquest of Western Europe and anything wearing a dress is just beginning to stir fears in Russia . Many of the novel ' s characters are introduced at a society hostess ' s orgy , among them Pierre Barkinmadski , the socially awkward but likeable bastard son of a rich c nt , and Andrew Bolloksoffski , the intelligent , horny and ambitious son of a retired military commander . We also meet the sneaky and shallow Kuragin family , including the wily father and maid shagger , Vasilini , the well hung fortune hunter son Amatole and the ravishing cock hungry daughter Helene . We are introduced to the Rostov ' s , a noble Moscow family , including the lively and always on heat daughter Natasha , the quiet , sexually repressed cousin Sonya and her collection of vibrators , and the impetuous muff diving son Nicholas , who has just joined the army led by the old General Ballsdeepski , well known for shagging young militiamen .
