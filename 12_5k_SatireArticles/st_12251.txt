Mildred Jacobs of Hanover , Maryland , said that " I came down this morning to breakfast and set my bowl of cream of wheat on the kitchen table . I looked at the computer picture frame that my grandkids sent me for Mother ' s Day and there was this advertisement for Viagra and Cialis and other pills to help me with my erectile dysfunction . I am a 72 year old widow and have never experienced erectile dysfunction in my life . I want to see the picture of my eleven year old granddaughter playing with her puppy ! "
