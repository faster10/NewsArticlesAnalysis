The dark dungeon is an amorphous mass , comprised of shiny onyx bricks . Although it ' s a gigantic structure , it is dwarfed by the other monolithic buildings that litter the landscape around The Gateway to Death . The scraggly , skinny , scabrous trees in front of the building are black and the grass growing around them is also black . There is a smoky haze surrounding the building akin to the haunting fog surrounding a dark castle in one of those old black and white horror movies that starred Bela Lugosi .
