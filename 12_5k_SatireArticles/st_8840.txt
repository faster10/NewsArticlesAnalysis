It was found at 8 . 15am by a passing motorist who had to swerve to avoid it . Michael Blackburn said " I was driving to work and out of the corner of my eye , I spotted a plain , basic , white piece of paper on the road . I had to swerve my car to avoid the receipt as I didn ' t want it sticking to my tyre . I almost crashed and could have been killed , but it was worth it knowing my tyre was receipt free . "
