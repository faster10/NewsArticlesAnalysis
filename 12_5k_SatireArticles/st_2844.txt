" Medicine has changed a great deal over the last 2 , 400 years , and ' purity ' and ' holiness ' are strong words that may no longer be viable given current cost outlays , " PhysCare Plus vice president of operations Dr Kyle Loveland said . " And , as far as the use of the word ' art ' goes , perhaps in ancient Greece physicians could consider themselves artists , but today ' s medical industry is a multibillion dollar business . " PhysCare Plus officials have proposed changing " purity and holiness " to " acumen and savvy , " and to change the term " art " to " career . "
