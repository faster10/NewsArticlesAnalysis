After securing the proper gear , and a quick lesson on tree climbing from a pro , Anderson climbed the tree in about four hours . According to Sheriff Elis Nottingham , Anderson encountered a very surprised and an endangered Spotted Owl ' s nest . With feathered fury , the female owl attacked a distraught Anderson . In Anderson ' s haste to escape the owl ' s wrath , she had to wrap her bare legs and arms around the trunk so she could quickly slide down the massive tree quickly in order to give as much space as possible to the nesting owl .
