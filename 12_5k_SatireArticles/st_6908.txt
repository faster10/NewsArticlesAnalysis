Pavlik did not actually venture into Rio de Janeiro proper , as an excursion to the city was not included in her travel package due to liability concerns over taking tourists to a teeming urban center where crime is rampant and less than half the inhabitants live in homes connected to a sewer system . Pavlik did , however , spend a great deal of time at the Little Rio Marketplace , a collection of stores and stands located between the Sol Rio resort and the neighboring Hotel do Frade resort .
