The recipient of the new head , Walter Mnztebeki , now living in London but originally from Ghana was too upset to speak yesterday but did manage to say " I was a fit 52 year old and only admitted to have a bunion removed . When I came round after the op the doctors told me there ' d been some kind of mistake . They passed me a mirror and I didn ' t recognise what was staring back at me . . . A white mans ' face of about 30 years old with blonde hair . It looked ridiculous sat there on my black body . I ' m getting used to it now but what upsets me most is that all my benefits have been stopped and i ' ve gone to the back of the waiting list for a house . "
