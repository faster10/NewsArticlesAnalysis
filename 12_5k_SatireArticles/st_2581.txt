" This year , it ' s about more than just doing big numbers on the Saffir Simpson Hurricane Damage Potential scale , " God continued . " It ' s about more than 18 foot wave surges and 60 foot yachts being blown miles inland . This year , it ' s about the whole experience . We ' re going to be taking people directly into the eye of the storm . And when we ' re done , people will feel like they truly know hurricanes inside out . "
