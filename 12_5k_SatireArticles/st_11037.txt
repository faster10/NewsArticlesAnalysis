People have the right to work for the welfare and betterment of themselves and their families but not at the expense of others and in full moral consciousness of the possible effects of their actions on others . Freedom is working for self and others for the betterment of the mental , spiritual and physical well being of all . Freedom is the right to defend oneself . . . but only when and if attacked , not on the basis of opportunism , fantasy or paranoia . Freedom derives from the singular fact that every man , woman and child on this planet has a right to live , to freedom of movement and the enjoyment of life and not a single person has more natural claims to the produce of this earth , or of the people on it , than another . Nor has anybody any more claim than another to happiness , respect or love . Thank you . ( Cheers and a standing ovation from all three ) .
