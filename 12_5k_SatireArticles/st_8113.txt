When asked if she had any plans to incorporate the results of this research into her practice or teaching , Fakker said her team had discussed this at some length . " I don ' t think we have to go back to the drawing board and start from scratch . I think we ' re on the right track . We will still have our healers pray , for example . But instead of having them project an image of healing white light , we are thinking of having them project an image of Daffy Duck onto their patient ' s auras next time . We ' re confident that their patient outcome scores will improve if they add that to their healing , " noted Fakker . She said she has already received a two million dollar National Institutes of Health grant to fund the next round of research , which will compare the results of healers infusing patient energy fields with images of either Daffy Duck , Bugs Bunny , or Homer Simpson .
