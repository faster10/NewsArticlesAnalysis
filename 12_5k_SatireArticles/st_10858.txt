" Al Qaeda again is seeking to harm Americans and in particular to target New York ' s fashionable poetry salons , " said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in New York Friday . " We are taking this threat seriously . Federal , state and local authorities are taking all steps to address it and we should be able to provide state authorized poetry within the week . Meanwhile , incarcerated poets , who wanted a one cent per word rise in pay , will be grilled and fileted in our Cuban facilities for terrorists , whether striking or ugly . "
