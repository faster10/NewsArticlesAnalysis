Gnarleson still had the grimy business card of a photo journalist from the local weekly , Moline Journal Advertiser . Gnarly had been the focus of an article about urban blight around the periphery of Moline proper , and the homeless " problem " . Gnarly spoke to the journalist and they arranged a time to inspect the munitions stockpile . As a result , hundreds of photos , reams of documents , a computer with records of the purchase of WMD from a phantom Halliburton subsidiary ( White Devil Enterprises ) by none other than evil dictator in the making , Sadam Hussein . Receipts of shipment , notebooks with coordinates to the location sites of other WMD caches in the United States it all seemed to add up to an unexplainable scenario , which included selling the WMD to Hussein in the 80 ' s , then stealing them back in secret commando raids just after the first Gulf War . The raiders replaced the real WMD with virtually undetectable duplicates with inert payloads . The real weapons contained a deadly cocktail of biological toxins or quick acting , fatal nerve gas .
