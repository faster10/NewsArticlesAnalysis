The two men had a stag dinner on Sunday evening . Mr Bush had earlier commented publicly that " the Soviet occupation of eastern Europe was one of the greatest wrongs of history ' " . Mr Putin retorted that the Soviets had almost single handedly defeated the Nazis the hard way , while the ' effete ' Allies struggled with mud in France . He went on to say that Eisenhower and Montgomery were more concerned with cocktail repartee than fighting battles ' . Mr Bush somewhat sheepishly said he was still trying to clean up Roosevelt ' s messes ' and that he was sorry .
