We cannot disclose specific information on the device , only some general facts about it , until they are ready to release it . The device is a stand in pod , much like a shower stall at a gym . A magnetic field emitter pulses around it once activated , until it reaches approximately 88 revolutions per second , at which point a small beam ( they will not tell me any specifics on this , so I apologize for being vague ) activates , casuing a reaction that sends the passenger through time . They soon found out that adjusting the size and intensity of the beam will send you either sooner or futher into the past or present . The device has a user friendly control box on it that lets you set this .
