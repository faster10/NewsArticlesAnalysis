The company that found the journal , Ronco , has been selling copies all around the world . A new religion has developed from the purported diary that has all members sending 29 . 99 per month ( plus 7 . 95 postage and handling ) to the company to get a copy of the next chapter in the journal ( but wait , there ' s more ! ) . Each monthly tithe also brings a new Christ blessed charm for their charm bracelet ( in authentic faux gold plate ) .
