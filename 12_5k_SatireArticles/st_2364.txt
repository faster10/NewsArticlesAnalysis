" I saw him again this morning , " said Sen . Ted Stevens ( R AK ) , who served on various subcommittees with Robb during his 1989 2001 senate tenure . " As usual , he was leaning against a column by the front steps , smoking a cigarette . I tried to act like I didn ' t see him , but he flagged me down and started asking me all these questions about new legislation and ' what ' s been up with everybody . ' It was so awkward . "
