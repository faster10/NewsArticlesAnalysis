According to the hastily drawn up plans , squads of R . O . T . C . students will be furnished with the latest military weapons and body armor . " We ' ll be able to field test this stuff before it ' s released to the soldiers in combat , saving lives , money , and time . Now , instead of using new recruits in the field to test equipment , we can use these brave lads right here in the good old U . S . A . That way , if any of this equipment is found to be faulty and , for example , a new type of body armor is unable to stop 20 rounds from an Uzi , we can correct it right away . We may lose a few brave students ' lives , but there ' s a price to pay for freedom in this country and the sooner our kids learn this , the better . "
