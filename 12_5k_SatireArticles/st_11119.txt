To be fair to everyone , if Sharia law were integrated into a country ' s legal system , then other religious ( taking ' religious ' in its broadest sense ) groups must be granted the same privilege , or else they could cry " Discrimination ! " . So we would see integration of Jewish law , Buddhist law , Hindu law , . . . . And what about Aboriginal law in Australia and Native American law in the US ? They must be included also . Satanic law ? It ' s a religious view so it must also be included . And so on and so on . . . . The result would be a legal maze of laws and precedents that would please the heart of any lawyer wishing to gain his her client ' s freedom .
