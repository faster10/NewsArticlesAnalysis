Anyway , frosh week has become a way of life for me . It ' s an escape from lugging around heavy boxes full of cookies 12 hours a day , 4 days a week . Sure , I ' ve thought about completing my education moving up in the workforce maybe starting my own business . But then I tell myself , " Could I really go on knowing that I could never be a frosh again ? Where else can you recreate the feeling you get from frosh week ? Feeling like you ' re shedding an old layer of skin , breaking out of your cocoon , putting behind you five years of grade school shenanigans , and looking forward to a prestigious four years of higher education and a world of limitless possibilities .
