" Ah don ' t normally hold with soft Southern puffs . Can ' t abide ' em meself but Adcock ' s got a point . There ' ll be people shunting one another up the rear end here in Blackburn too , and we can ' t be doing wi ' that . Also , we ' ve gorra lorra Muslims in my ward , and they ' re not used to seeing 40 foot posters of naked busty young wenches . They don ' t get that at home I can see some of the older chaps keeling over with coronaries , as well as motorists shuntin ' one another up the rear . Add all that lot together and you ' ve got a recipe for disaster . Th ' emergency services ' ll be run off their bloody feet . "
