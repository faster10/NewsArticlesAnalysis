" Sometimes I have to pretend to get mad and yell at someone who I ' m not even angry with and that person is pretending to be someone else , too , so I have to call them by the name of the person they are pretending to be while I ' m yelling at them , " said Harris , adding that he occasionally catches his own reflection in a mirror or pane of glass while he ' s pretending to be someone else and it " cracks him up every time . " " Most of the time when they ' re filming me acting like a guy who ' s not me , I ' m just hoping to get through it without smiling or laughing when I look at the person I ' m talking to . "
