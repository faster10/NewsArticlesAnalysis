The whole concept behind ' vaping ' is to provide inhalers with a safe way to quit smoking cigarettes . The vapors and " clouds " produced while puffing traditional vaping horns are believed to be much safer than smoking full flavored , or even " light " tobacco cigarettes . Vaping vapors are comprised of water , not smoke , and many vaping horns do not include addictive nicotine . But some coffeehouse goers complain that those who " vape " create even more " clouds " than an Oklahoma thunderstorm during tornado season , or , at least five guys sucking away on a hooka bong .
