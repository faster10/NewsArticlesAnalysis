' Little Barry and the Choom Gang ' is modeled after several old programs of the past that used the same format . In the 1950 ' s , The Mickey Mouse Club used a group of youths and adults who entertained children with singing , dancing , cartoons , adventure stories , and other activities . In the 1970 ' s , Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids followed much of the same premise in a thirty minute , animated , Saturday morning television show . Politically , a similar model might be The Hitler Youth of the 1930 ' s and 1940 ' s , where children had uniforms and participated in activities to unite themselves together for the common good .
