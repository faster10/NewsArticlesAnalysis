The video was only seen by producers and assistant directors , but laughter could be heard coming from the stage of the closed set . Insiders say that the new video shows Kim eating a juicy pear , bending at the waist often to pick up an accidentally dropped pencil , and practicing a few lines with her mother that included quotes like " Ew , I don ' t want to " , " That ' s not Cartier , and trust me , I know Cartier " , and " Bruce , why can ' t you be more like my real dad ? " .
