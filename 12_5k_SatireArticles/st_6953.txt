" You wouldn ' t believe the things I ' ve hauled off , " Ciszek said . " Fully functional air conditioners , entire record collections , VCRs , unopened boxes of cereal and canned goods , like new chairs , desks with barely a scratch , stereo components , computers you name it . I don ' t know how many pairs of shoes still in the box , never been worn , I ' ve tossed in the back of the truck . I must have junked 50 miles of extension cords , and I ' m guessing 95 percent of those still worked . "
