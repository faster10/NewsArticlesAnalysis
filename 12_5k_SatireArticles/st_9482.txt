Even so , Creel says he has started to do some good deeds on the side just small things when the band ' s not playing . " This isn ' t to try to get into God ' s good graces or anything like that , " Creel said . " I don ' t pretend that God is suddenly going to say , ' Oh , Jason , I see you ' re really a good person , so I ' ll protect you from that evil Satan . ' But I figure it can ' t hurt , you know ? I mean , it ' s not like I ' m going to make Satan mad and He ' s going to say , ' Buttering up Mr Good , eh ? Well , two infinities of Hell for you ! ' What ' s the difference if it ' s one infinity or two infinities ? It ' s never ending either way . So , to me , I have something to gain and nothing to lose . "
