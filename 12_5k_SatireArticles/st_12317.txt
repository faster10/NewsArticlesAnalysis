Just before they shut the doors chicken soup was going for 7 . 95 , Novie , Eggs , onions , potatoes and a bagel were served up for 18 . 95 ( US ) , and the famous pastrami , corned beef and salami piled high on home made rye were going for 16 . 95 and up depending on add ons . Even a lowly tuna fish sandwich was served up for 14 . 95 , and non of these included the dreaded " Bloomberg " city tax of 8 . 875 , or state or federal levies . Did I mention a tip ? Priceless !
