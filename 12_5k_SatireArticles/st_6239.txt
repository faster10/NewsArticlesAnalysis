Shoe store manager Janet Dreisbach , a once bitten , twice shy , recently divorced professional with above average looks , had a similar experience with Zollner . " When I saw 2567 ' s ad , it seemed too good to be true , " said Dreisbach , who has been looking for a discriminating soulmate for good times and great conversation since February 1996 .
