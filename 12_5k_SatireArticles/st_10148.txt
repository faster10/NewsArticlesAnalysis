Former Governor of Alaska Mike Gravel ( rhymes with death knell ) who is legally dead in 48 states railed against war " What ' s it good for ? " and young Biden ' s " arrogance " in telling the Shah how to run Persia . He provided much needed comic relief when he identified himself as the " senior statesman " on the stage , rippped off a lame old Reagan Mondale wisecrack , and drolled on himself in a dead on Zell Miller impersonation as he challenged Chris Matthews to a " dyew ell . "
