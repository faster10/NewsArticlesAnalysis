I come to face first on the floor in another puddle of vomit ( we had eaten mutton ) and by this time my wife has opened the door , frantic , asking what ' s wrong . I ' m not ashamed to admit , I am crying more than a little as I tell her about the upsetting image Showtime has force fed down our television screen . And there I am , left crying , shaking and caked in vomit in my naked wife ' s arms ( she has to be naked to use the restroom and she wouldn ' t mind me telling you that ) .
