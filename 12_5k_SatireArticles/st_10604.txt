" Towle made me see things about myself that I had always been too afraid to face , " Krappler said , smiling . " It wasn ' t the Jews and the Blacks and all the immigrants that were making my life miserable . It was my fear of intimacy . When I said I was proud to be Aryan , I didn ' t really know what that meant . And I didn ' t want others to find out , because they might see something they could shame me with . And so I responded with hostility , when all I wanted was someone to love me just for who I really was . "
