A crowd of pro Gay RIghts supporters cheered the Governator as he left the podium , wife Pam Shriver on one arm , and Michael Jackson on the other . After the crowd had dissipated and few people remained at the gathering place , tea and crumpets were served inside the governor ' s mansion . A toast , given by Rosie O ' Donnell , who was accompanied by her partner , went as follows : " A toast to Arnold , the host with the most and the people ' s governor . Thanks to him , all of those like us will be free to live together and be happy together . Cheers for the Governator . "
