Today , one the greatest hoaxes ever foiled took place on location where President Obama called a press conference . When the surprise keynote speaker was announced , media and eager observers cheered when the name Superman was called forth . Immediately however , cheering soon turned into gasps and the halitosis of the audience lingered in the air as slack jawed faces beheld a strange sight . Not one , but four men in the famed Superman tights walked onto the stage . Audience members were not the only ones in shock , but it appeared that the four men in costume were also surprised , surprised to see each other in one place . After a quick huddle session , one of the four super heroes came forward to the microphone and began to explain a troubling truth that was not met with much favour . Four words that history won ' t soon forget were spoken " Superman does not exist ! "
