In light of the recent attack , an unnamed White House official has informed reporters that President Bush is considering proclaiming a mandatory " shoe registration " program that is expected to cost 3 . 2 billion over the next five years . With the exception of infants under two years of age and amputees , all citizens will be required to carry a permit while wearing shoes in public places . The National Shoe Manufacturer ' s Association has responded by threatening to launch a class action lawsuit on behalf of all shoe owners in the U . S . " Wearing shoes is a constitutional right that cannot be overturned solely by Presidential decree " , it said in a press release . " Such a law is a kick in the teeth to all patriotic Americans . "
