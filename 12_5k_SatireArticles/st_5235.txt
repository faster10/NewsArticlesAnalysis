" There ' s a place on Mockingbird Lane that I must have sold half a dozen times in two years , it was so hot , " says Alan Foxman , an independent Realtor in Boston . " I ' d tell them about the doorway to hell in the master bedroom , and they ' d just think , ' extra storage space . ' A month later they ' d call , absolutely horrified , and I ' d sell it to someone else at a handsome profit . Everyone walked away happy . These days , though , the scavengers are too scared to go in and strip its copper pipes . "
