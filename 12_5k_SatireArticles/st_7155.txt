Anonymous sources claim that marketing departments will be running some interesting ad campaigns if they land the Obama account . Their first set of ads will probably use a fake Presidential seal and have the former President do what he does best . . . " All he has to do is point at the camera and start criticizing guns . We just follow up with another ad spot for our gun , 30 seconds later . It allows Mr Obama to distance himself from the guns , and we get the profit . It ' s like using the Devil to sell Heaven . It worked for Jonathan Edwards . And just like the Devil , Obama loves the attention he gets . "
