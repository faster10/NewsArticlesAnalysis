" After all , I ' ve deserted the American military , killed hundreds of guards , and betrayed my would be lover , Meryl Silverburgh , by submitting to torture in the alternate ending to the first installment of ' Metal Gear Solid . ' But sometimes , like when I suicidally attack dozens of armed guards with only my bare hands , it seems that God is putting me through hell merely to amuse Himself . It just doesn ' t make sense .
