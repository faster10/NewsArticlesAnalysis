The award of the MBE was clearly a humbling experience for the former teacher and Inland Revenue inspector . Shortly after receiving his gong , Sting said : " " I didn ' t ever imagine that when I set off from Newcastle with a guitar and a bag of songs that I would end up here at Buckingham Palace . It ' s a landmark for me an acceptance of my work in the world , because I do feel I represent Great Britain in the world . I ' d be surprised if she ( the Queen ) knows my music . I know Charles listens to it but there ' s always hope . "
