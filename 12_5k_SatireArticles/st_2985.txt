" The positive , soul enriching sentiments associated with the holiday season are shared by almost all Americans , regardless of religious beliefs or cultural backgrounds , " Samuelson said . " But it is only through our regular mean spirited shallowness the rest of the year that the spirit of Christmas can , by contrast , move us so deeply , deluding the populace into thinking their lives are actually beautiful . If everybody behaved so kindly to one another all year round , Christmas wouldn ' t seem special at all . And then , the magic of Christmas would be lost forever , swallowed up by a year round sense of basic human decency that would rob the holidays of their warm glow , ruining Christmas for all the little children of the world .
