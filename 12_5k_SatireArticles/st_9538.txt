When asked if he thought it was hypocritical of him to pardon himself for breaking a law that he himself refused to change , Stevens said no . " How can it be hypocritical when I ' m trying to stand up for family values ? " he said . " We need to keep criminals and low lifes away from a lifestyle substance like marijuana , and that ' s why I rejected last year ' s bill . Now I ' m saying it ' s time to get government out of the freedom of people who can use marijuana responsibly . So , it ' s critical I be here , in office and working hard every day , to help advance this cause . "
