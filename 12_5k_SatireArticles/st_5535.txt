The shame of this is that the real victims here are you , the readers . I wish I had a " magic bullet " that could prevent these kind of things from happening but let ' s not be too hard on my editors . They are under a lot of pressure with budget shortfalls and all sorts of various news stories that seem to break at a moment ' s notice . They are trying their best , I believe , and we should use an extra dollop of patience and learn to forgive them . I can ' t hold a grudge forever .
