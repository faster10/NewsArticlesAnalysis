Residents of the island have only just begun to hear about the plan . Needless to say , they aren ' t too happy . " It ' s hard enough to live on an island where we feel ignored by Sacramento and Washington . Now we will have to deal with a foreign nation ? What are we going to do next , sell off Malibu ? " asks Bob Kennedy , mayor of Avalon , the only town on the island . " We are Americans , all of us . I don ' t care what the looming deficit amounts to , it ' s my backyard on the chopping block . I feel like we are the Thirteen Colonies and Jerry Brown is King George . "
