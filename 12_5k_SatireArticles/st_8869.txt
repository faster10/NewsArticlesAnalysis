Buzzfeed News reports that the monkey heads and primate parts were shipped in from Indonesia . There was no mention made in the BuzzFeed News article concerning the specifics of the extreme pornographic images of animals . One cannot help but wonder if George Bush the weirdo from the Erith area of London , England , and not , and I repeat , not , either the 41st or 43rd President of the United States , had any leading man part in any of the pornographic images of the animals found in his possession . We ' re only human , right ? Isn ' t it normal for us to wonder about such things ? And brothers and sisters , just be grateful you ' re on top of the food chain and you ' re not a diminutive , naive , victimized macaque monkey .
