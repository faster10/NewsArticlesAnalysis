This is not the first time legislators have found themselves living in terror of the scaly abomination . During Thomas Jefferson ' s presidency , the 8th U . S . Congress lost nine senators and 21 representatives to the aquatic fiend before it was able to secure enough votes to pass H . R . 243 , the Back From Whence It Came proposal . In 1954 , Sens . Sam Ervin ( D NC ) and Henry Dworshak ( R ID ) thought they had finally destroyed the swamp creature for good , after repeatedly stabbing the beast , spraying it with DDT , and dumping its body in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal . But after legislators discovered the gruesome remains of the Energy and Water Development subcommittee a few weeks later , Ervin admitted they had probably only aggravated the monster ' s aquatic wrath .
