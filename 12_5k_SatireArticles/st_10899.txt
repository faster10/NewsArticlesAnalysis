As we toured the electric generating station , we were often accosted by sheepish gazes . There is not many of the TEPCOW people working on the generating side of the plant who will talk to reporters . They try to mind their own business . But one man wasn ' t ashamed . " I think this is so good for the environment , " he states , speaking of the whale blubber plant . Mr Sato claims that the plant is safe and smart . " We are increasing our power output to the grid almost daily . I am so proud of the contribution of the whales ! Those people out there ( pointing to the refrigerated whale butchers ) reflect the way Japanese people are resilient in a crisis . I think they say in English , ' When life gives you lemons , make yellow tea . ' " Although Mr Sato ' s recollection of English idioms isn ' t completely accurate , we believe his sentiments speak for the TEPCOW project : the people of Japan are going to do whatever possible to overcome their nuclear tragedy . And whales are going to be a vital part . They will make their " yellow tea " , or lemonade . . . whatever you prefer to call it .
