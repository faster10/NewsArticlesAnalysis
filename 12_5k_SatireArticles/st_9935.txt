After The Donald announced the erroneous origins of his bid for President his poll numbers surprisingly went up . " The American people are just happy to have someone who sounds like a straight talker running for President , " he explained . " They ' re sick of bought and paid for politicians being their only choices during elections . Fortunately for them , I don ' t answer to anyone but me . I ' m sure the idea of a guy like me in the White House helps a lot of you regular Americans sleep better at night . You ' re welcome ! "
