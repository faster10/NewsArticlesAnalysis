Explained Presidential spokesman Tod Schlange " Democracy has progressed to the point where we see political parties as companies , more or less , with voters as share holders . Each vote is a share in the company . Therefore , in a capitalist world , which we all enjoy , we feel people should be able to buy and sell their share . . . or accumulate them as well , as they see fit . Our president has lifted the illegality of selling votes in what is undoubtedly a major progressive move for democracy . "
