" During this campaign , I had the good fortune to meet so many of you . And I listened to your concerns , " Bush or Gore said . " And do you know what I found ? That your concerns are the same as mine . Like 64 year old Rosemary Cullums of Wheeling , WV . She said to me , ' Mr Bush or Mr Gore , we need to restore a sense of values and decency to this country . I have three young grandchildren , and I worry about the filth they ' re exposed to on a daily basis from TV and the movies . We need Hollywood to take responsibility for its actions and stop peddling sex and violence to our young people . ' I told Rosemary I agreed wholeheartedly and gave her my word that when I became president , I would demand accountability on the part of the entertainment industry . Would my Democratic or Republican opponent have said the same ? "
