BAGHDAD The 4 , 000 Louisiana National Guardsmen stationed in Iraq , representing over a third of the state ' s troops , called home this week to find out what , if any , help they could offer Katrina survivors from overseas . " The soldiers wanted to know if they could call 911 for anyone , or perhaps send some water via FedEx , " said Louisiana National Guard spokesman Lt . Col . Pete Schneider . The Guardsmen also " would love to send generators , rations , and Black Hawk helicopters for rescue missions , " but , said Schneider , " we desperately need these in Iraq to stay alive . " Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld praised the phone support , but noted that it would take months to transfer any equipment from Iraq to New Orleans , saying , " You fight a national disaster with the equipment you have . "
