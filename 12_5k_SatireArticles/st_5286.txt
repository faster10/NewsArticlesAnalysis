Among the victims of al Qaeda ' s telemarketing efforts is Coral Gables , FL , retiree Bernice Parks , who last Friday spent nearly 45 minutes trying to say no to a pushy aluminum siding salesman who identified himself only as " Mohammed , " only to give in and order full siding for her home . It is believed that the 3 , 000 charged to Parks ' credit card an amount she thought to be " a rock bottom value , especially compared to what big companies like Sears charge " was funneled through al Qaeda ' s extensive siding cartel .
