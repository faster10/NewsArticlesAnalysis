The only one to ever speak of the bank was the man who built it . Klaus Greenbach fled to Colombia on its completion where he wrote his book " The Bank of Atlantis " . That book , published in New York in 1960 , lasted no more than a week in book stores . It was ordered by the CIA to be confiscated and all copies destroyed . The whereabouts of the publishers are to date unknown . Klaus himself , a Post Office worker , met with an unfortunate accident when the Volkswagen he was driving to work one morning mysteriously blew up . Two red bricks were found in Klaus ' s jacket pockets , but foul play was not suspected . A verdict of " misadventure " was returned by the court of Bogot .
