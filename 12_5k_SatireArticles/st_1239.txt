" Our government scrubs the internet of everything it considers remotely objectionable , and when I stop to really consider what that means , I ' m perfectly fine with it , " said Shenzhen resident Bao Ling , whose online activity is heavily monitored by her nation ' s cybersecurity analysts , and who has not once been invited by a microwave popcorn company ' s pop up ad to " join the conversation about their brand . " Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to have unrestricted use of email and be able to read a pro democracy blog without one of our state controlled internet service providers immediately taking it offline . But that would also mean sifting through countless spam messages advertising work from home opportunities and navigating vast scrollable catalogues of celebrity nip slips . That ' s not a trade off I want to make . "
