It ' s true there isn ' t much known about the real Shakespeare . About all we know for sure is that he had a wife who ended up sleeping in a second best bed and a haircut similar in style to Kelsey Grammer ' s in Frasier . And , of course , Oxfordians believe he was merely a front man for Edward de Vere . But what if they have it completely backwards ? What if William Shakespeare of Stratford was the ghostwriter of the plays attributed to the Earl of Oxford ?
