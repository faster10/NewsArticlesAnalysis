But try to cheat and you WILL get caught . Try to omit at least minimum required calorie re insertion in the products you buy and consume and you ' ll regret it . Within 24 hours of under consumption of caloric daily minimums will result in a grotesque wart sprouting on the end of your nose that will grow bristly hair and exude green pus . Try to remove the wart and it will turn immediately malignant and rot your brain . So , be safe , don ' t scare the neighbors ' kids , and just follow the rules . Eat , but don ' t cheat !
