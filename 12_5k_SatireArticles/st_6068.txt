" We ' ve made some major changes to Air Force One in order to reflect our new emphasis on customer service , " said Air Force chief of staff Gen . T . Michael Moseley . " On each aircraft , the conference room , office , workout room , bedroom , and war room have been gutted and replaced with narrow rows and plush seats to accommodate additional passengers . Our former private chef service has been replaced by carts of drinks and economically priced prepackaged snacks . Even the escape hatch , originally designed for sneaking away from Kazakh hijackers but never used , has been converted into luggage storage . "
