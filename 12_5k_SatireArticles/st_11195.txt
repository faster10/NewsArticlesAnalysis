The Honourable Winston Churchill was known for his flatulence and we honour him for it . But we are moving in modern times , Mister Speaker , and a chorus of farts from the back benches while serious matters concerning the displacement of millions of people in the Far East all headed in our direction is no laughing matter . I see the Honourable Member for East Anglia sniggering , the fat bastard . Put a cork in it Cecil . . . have mercy on the House for Christssakes ! Wanton parliamentary flatulence is not a tradition I , for one , am prepared to die for .
