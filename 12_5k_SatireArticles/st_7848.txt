Vicki Stubing was happy for reasons of her own . " I ' m not going to be the Captain ' s little girl any more ! I don ' t have to have a room in his cabin and have a curfew and check in with him every night . Now I can party and have boyfriends and get drunk and stay out as long as I want to . I can bring men to my room and there is not a thing he can do about it ! "
