Presumptive Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry was questioned about the supposed presidential cloning project while addressing the Union of Food and Commercial Workers in Milwaukee . Kerry responded with , " I can tell you , with God as my witness , that I have no knowledge of this heinous act . When I am president , I will slice this horrible monster in two , and expose all those involved . Our Constitution plainly states that the President of the United States must be a natural born citizen not cloned ! The government is using taxpayers ' hard earned tax dollars to fund hideous cloning projects , and that cannot continue . I ' ll blow the lid off this conspiracy and make 2 million new jobs during my first year . " Kerry droned on about jobs , how much he hated Bush and the evils of outsourcing for another hour or so .
