" Participants were very worried about larger human issues like injuries , illnesses , and aging , but also things like sweating too much , getting fat , smelling bad , and feeling sore , " said Norris , adding that survey respondents liked the idea of being very soft like a bear . " In addition , most noted that if an animatronic bear did have a problem , a technician would repair it right away . A small percentage said even if they stopped working entirely , they would still rather be a nonfunctioning animatronic bear than a human . "
