" A lot of the retiring Bush administration have signed on as characters in the park . Dick Cheney is going to play either Captain Hook or Grumpy , depending on his mood of the day . Condleeza Rice will be the evil witch from Snow White . Karl Rove will play the Big Bad Wolf who blows the piggies houses down . George W will be playing himself because none of the characters we have could match his authenticity . He is very enthusiastic about it because he will be living in our White House and will feel as though he is still President . "
