Reginald Toaster , the famous 500 pound baby ( now aged 17 ) allegedly fathered by Bigfoot , reported to the Ft . Smith , Arkansas Police Department that he had seen the late Elvis Presley . " The King was dressed in his famous white jumpsuit . I done seen him leave the Daylight Donuts and fly away in a UFO . It was the fat Elvis , it weren ' t the skinny one . He still had them long , bushy sideburns and was wearing sunglasses . Before anybody accuses me of it , I didn ' t have any fur in my eyes and I ain ' t been drinkin ' any moonshine . "
