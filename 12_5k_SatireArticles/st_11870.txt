Siobhan O ' Reilly , who has been with Harry for five years now , was not trying to make life harder for future husband . " I was tired of getting birthday messages from people I hadn ' t seen since elementary school and who didn ' t even get along with me back then . Last year , my phone vibrated so often with facebook notifications that I developed a bruise on my leg , " she said . " That ' s why I took the date down I only want birthday messages from people who care enough to know when it is . "
