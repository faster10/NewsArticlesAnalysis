" In cases of this kind , " said Police Constable Jim , " It is not unusual for the secret accomplice to a crime to act as normally as possible as she pretends not to notice the crime taking place . He or she is only there for support if the crime takes an unexpected twist . If you see someone acting normally , it ' s usually a sign that they have either just committed a crime , are currently committing a crime or are planning their next crime . This can be quite clearly be seen in the case of Mrs Casey proceeding with her weekly shopping . "
