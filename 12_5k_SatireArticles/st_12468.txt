The man gave him his rehearsed phony name , close by , but phony street address , and zip code . Oddly , the logistics guy had to ask for the phone number ! The trap was set and the bait greedily taken . The man had given them the phony address of 3467 Bergenfield Road , which was close enough to his real address of 3467 Bergenfield Circle to be believeable . The logistics guys thanked him and promised a free gift of some sort ( that yard sign ? ) and hung up .
