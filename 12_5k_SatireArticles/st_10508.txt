In response to Kerry ' s accusations , President Bush issued this simple written statement to the press : " I have never , in any way , participated in any sort of voodoo magic or any magic at all . Well , I did have a magic kit when I was a child , but I stopped playing with it after I lost the wand . It just wasn ' t the same without the wand . Hey , none of you press people have found it , have you ? It looks like this . crudely drawn picture of a wand If any of you find it , would you let me know ? Thanks bunches .
