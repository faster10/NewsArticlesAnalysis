" Sir or madam , if only you could have seen the anger and revulsion that washed over my face as I found that SeanPenn gmail . com , Penn gmail . com , SPenn gmail . com , Penn . Sean gmail . com , and SeanPennRules gmail . com had all been taken , " Penn ' s letter read . " If only you could have felt my heart leap to my throat upon realizing that Seanpenn gmail . com would not work either , as Gmail addresses are not case senstitive . If only you could have heard my cry of anguish when , in a last , desperate move , I typed in Spicoli gmail . com , only to be rejected once more and finally forced to accept the abomination that is Sean . Penn20061 gmail . com . "
