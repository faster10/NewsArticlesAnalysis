" Back when kittens ( actually full grown cats ) were thrown by their tails , there was constantly a problem with tail separation . It could get pretty messy , not to mention having to replace so many scaredy cats all the time . But what we have developed for Canada ' s 2012 Olympic Team will make an even bigger impact on track and field . Anyone wearing our patented Canofab suit will run 20 to 30 percent faster than their counterparts . It ' s the difference between not qualifying for the 100 metres and breaking a world record . I have seen a 40 year old track coach run the 100 metres in under 10 seconds . In ankle deep snow . It ' s unbelievable , " says Pippa Seccombe Helt , Director of the Aurora Research Institute .
