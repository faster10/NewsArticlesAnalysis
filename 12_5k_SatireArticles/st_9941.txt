" Look at Kennedy Union , the very heart of the student body exists in those walls . Students love that building from the inside and out . It starts with the ocean of orange that welcomes you at each and every door . And why would we need to add the elegance of an Oakwood manor to the student experience when they already have the sheer beauty that is the Kennedy Union Ballroom ? Don ' t all of these kids think they live in a ghetto anyway ? "
