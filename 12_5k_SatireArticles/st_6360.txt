I thought this happened in 2009 , but it turns out it happened at the beginning of 2010 . This was a good thing because it made the people of New Orleans happy , which many of them had not felt or been since most of them drowned there . But it was also a bad thing because I want them to move the Saints to somewhere else like Hawaii or Brazil . That would be great if they played football games in one of those places , and I could hang out there like " oh I ' m covering the game . " New Orleans is the worst .
