The three billion dollar bequest is the largest ever received by an American educational institution . The American Church of Devil Worshippers , in whose name the bequest arrived , said they were proud to be associated with a University which has for years espoused similar goals and morals as the Church . As part of the bequest , Auburn was required to change the name of the University , change the school ' s mascot from a tiger to Spawn of Satan , and make every effort to ensure that students and alumni no longer scream " War Eagle . " The new substitute cry at athletic events will be " Win for me oh Satan ! "
