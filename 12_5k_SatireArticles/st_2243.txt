" There ' s no way I could remember the names of all the Muslim citizens that our agents brought in to discuss the beauty of Islam with one on one , but rest assured that with their help , the FBI has gained a deep and illuminating understanding of Islamic culture , " said Comey , who noted that by combing through thousands upon thousands of citizens ' banking records , agents discovered with astonishment how some observant Muslims set up special loan payment plans to avoid paying interest , as they consider it usury , which is forbidden under Sharia law . " It ' s crazy to think about , but until little more than a decade ago , I had no idea there were Five Pillars of Islam that guided all Muslims ' spiritual lives . I also didn ' t know anything about the multitude of Muslim contributions to mathematics and science that have been absolutely vital to the world . But that ' s not to say they don ' t value art , though . Poets like Rumi and Hafez drew upon mystical Sufist interpretations of the Quran to write verse that is every bit as sublime as , say , Keats or Coleridge . And don ' t even get me started on the architecture . "
