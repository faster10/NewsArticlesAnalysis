" Me and my brother are pretty independent so every Father ' s Day we ' d each get him about five or six ties . Three years ago , on his sixtieth birthday , we each got him a package of 60 ties , too , " said Dennis , Chuck ' s eldest son , " when it came time to run the numbers this year , we all realized that there were no more ties to get him . I guess we ' re done then . "
