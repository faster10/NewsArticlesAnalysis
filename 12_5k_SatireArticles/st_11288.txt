" Though it may seem strange for me to lend support to the infidel camel humper Bush , I feel that his leadership of the United States will do more harm to the Godless Americans in 4 more years than I could do with 4 lifetimes of Al Qaeda leadership . His economic policies can only lead to a society with a small upper class of weak multi millionaires who do not know the first thing about fighting or sacrifice , with a vast majority in the angry , virile peasant class who shall eventually take arms and rise up against their wealthy oppressors . If Bush is re elected , I predict that within 10 years we will see the heads of American infidel millionaires on pikes and a rejection of the evil capitalist hierarchy to which most Americans now bow .
