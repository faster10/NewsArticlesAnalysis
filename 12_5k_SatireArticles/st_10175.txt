The Freedom Fighters interrogated Cheney regarding Operation Silencer , the media blackout on Ron Paul . According to English guitarist , producer , film star Keith Richards , an honorary Freedom Fighter who helped conduct the interrogation , Cheney first claimed executive privilege , and then claimed that he was not part of the executive branch . Later he claimed he was not actually the Vice President , but rather a convenience store owner who got lost on his way to breakfast . Eventually Cheney admitted to ordering the FBI and CIA to conduct Operation Silencer , and the documents ordering Operation Silencer were wrestled from Karl Rove as he dashed towards a paper shredder . Richards said he enjoyed flicking lit cigarettes at Rove , but took pity on Coulter , offering to share his makeup tips with the gangly blonde . " Just look at her . She ' s a dreadful thing , " announced Richards , shaking his head " Perhaps if she felt better about her appearance , she wouldn ' t be so bleedin ' mean " .
