Ironically , De La Derriere soon found global fame , becoming well known in the comments section of the Daily Male website , on the back of his viral YouTube exploits . Following on from this , he founded his own internet blog : www . twistedmelonsman . con but quickly became disillusioned when it died a death by apathy . It seemed that no matter how much De La Derriere vented his spleen on the blog , there were only ever one or two like minded padded cell jobs who were prepared to indulge him in his extravagance , and he lapsed into depression , frequently indulging in copious amounts of opium and absinthe in his lonely Calais garret .
