NEW YORK ( Reuters ) Pop singer Britney Spears is waiting to be bailed out of jail after being arrested Tuesday on charges of insurance fraud . Several international insurance companies are cooperating in the investigation against the 23 year old singer . It appears that not only did Britney Spears lie about pre existing injuries to her knee when she applied for insurance coverage , she also neglected to reveal that she had undergone a complete skin transplant to treat a raging acne condition , broke two wrists and a foot in a bar room brawl , and had three botched breast implant procedures . Worst of all , she failed to divulge that she was incapable of singing or dancing without the aid of cables and wires strung from above the stage .
