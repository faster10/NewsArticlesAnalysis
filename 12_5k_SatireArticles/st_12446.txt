There used to be times that I would leave the house ( or the office ) just to get away from the stupid telephone . Now , you have to have it attached to your belt and it follows you everywhere . To make matters worse , it ' s even got GPS so that " everyone " knows where that " everywhere " is ( and by everyone , I do now include the NSA ! ) . Yes , Big Brother is watching you and it is worse than Santa .
