Mr Putin , Herr Vlad himself , had this to say : " International peoples , lend me your ears ! In no way am I or my countrymen involved in this revolution going on in eastern Ukraine ! It is a natural thing when people are oppressed by one country and would rather get oppressed by another , bigger country . These peoples in eastern Ukraine are Russian speaking people who want to be rejoined with the motherland after having moved here decades ago and taken this land away from the Ukraine people . Now we want to do it again . It is now our land and we want to be free to do with it as we wish . And we want to do with Ukraine peoples land in this area as we want . "
