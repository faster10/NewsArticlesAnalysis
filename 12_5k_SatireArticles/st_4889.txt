" You know that Darrent , the guy who ' s going to get tragically stabbed , has always had it in for me , " Jones added . " By the time he gets put in the hospital or killed , he will have thrown me out of his club at least twice , and there ' s two days between now and the stabbing . I think he ' s going to use getting cut up as an excuse to get at my money , is what I think . "
