After debuting in the WFBA last August and becoming known as " Ironed Hair Mike , " " Kid Transvest Dynamite , " and " The Baddest Man Dressed As A Woman On The Planet , " Tyson quickly earned a reputation as a slow , graceless power puncher whose only flash came from his Swarovski crystal anklets . His only win , against Wendy " Wheels " Wielinski in February , is still disputed by foxy boxing cognoscenti who claim Tyson was able to land several punches to the side of his opponent ' s head when Wielinski , an Iraq War veteran , experienced technical problems with her wheelchair . Tyson himself was severely battered in that fight , also suffering deep lacerations and bite wounds when he was attacked in the post fight press conference by Wielinski ' s guide dog .
