According to sources , the faintly perceptible voice located in the recesses of Kim ' s mind continued communicating with the dictator during the presentation of a propaganda film depicting the nuclear annihilation of the United States ' Eastern Seaboard . The soft whisper told the North Korean leader that the film was not only strange looking because it was clearly rendered from a video game , but also filled with factual inaccuracies . The voice went on to note that when Kim Jong un endorsed the video and shared it with millions of people all over the world , it made him seem like he didn ' t know what was going on and that something was deeply wrong with him psychologically .
