The longhorns here are descended from vast herds driven down from Chicago by Banks ' great grandfather , infamous cattle moron Cody Banks . " Curious Cody , " was an independent thinker in his own right , and by all accounts , a typical Banks . The earliest recorded member of the family came over as a midshipman on the Mayflower in 1622 , again in 1624 , twice in 1625 , and finally in 1627 , when , as he wrote in his diary , he finally realized he was allowed to leave the middle of the ship .
