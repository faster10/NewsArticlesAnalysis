These G men talked in monotone at all times . They both exhibited an annoying nasal twang while orating their dialogues and orders . And every word they uttered was bland , banal cacophony . I put this aside here just in case this short short story becomes a movie script of some kind . Our favorite G Men were gambling at an opulent amorphous casino on the strip that was housed in a building that looked like a giant dinosaur egg . Their jobs were usually filled with deadwood time . There were always incredibly big gaps between incinerations that they found incredibly boring .
