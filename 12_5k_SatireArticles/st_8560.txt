" Im a firm believer in not touching a car if you ' ve been to your local , not even if you ' ve just had one . All it takes is one swerve and you could end up totalling your car onto a lampost . Something that could be a real hazzard to people who use the roads at night . As a footballer and someone who is in the public eye I believe the youth will listen to me , and I hope I can be an example to them .
