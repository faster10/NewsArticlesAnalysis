Critics accuse the EPA of causing mass hysteria . This is unfounded , as the ruling explains why people should use bathrooms without a wall . " Walls are for scaring people away . We feel that there will be an increase in bathroom use and compliance by removing the walls . We need a comforting safe place without walls and without limitations to do our business . We need to stop offending people and begin the healing process . This ruling will improve the sanitary disposal system of our nation , " says EPA spokesperson Logan Kerr Plopp .
