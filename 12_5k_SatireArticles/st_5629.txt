" Whether it ' s a card , a Mylar balloon , or a big decorated cookie , it ' s really nice for someone to say ' Good job . I notice what you do , ' " Rumsfeld said . " Some secretaries say , ' I work my hiney off all year round , and I ' m supposed to go nuts over a 25 Bath Body Works gift certificate ? ' But I ' m telling you , every smidgen of recognition counts . I ' ve worked in places that didn ' t observe Secretary ' s Day at all , like the Ford White House . "
