First , MDID is a one man band that ' s been recording since 1985 . Second , MDID stands for My Dad Is Dead , but self named band leader Mark Edwards abbreviated the name after repeatedly being asked what it meant . Third , Edwards sounds a lot like Joy Division ' s Ian Curtis . One would assume the oodgates for musical pretension would be wide open . That may be true , but Edwards is adept at blending low punk hooks with challenging guitar and monotone vocals . It ' s dirty , it ' s pretty , it ' s an intense listening experience , and thankfully the lyrics aren ' t as embittered as one might expect . JG
