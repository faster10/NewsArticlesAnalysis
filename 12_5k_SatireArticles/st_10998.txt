A well codified text language can simplify communications , and save time . However , things can go awry if a character does not logically follow from a previously sent character . Ian explains that " having different styles of communication with different people can be confusing at times . " He further explains that he once mistakenly sent a full word " props " to his girlfriend , thinking that he was texting his friend Fred , who had indicated in another text that he had just kissed the prettiest girl in school . " I was really nervous when my girlfriend sent me a message with ' ? ? ' , which means that she is confused and upset , using two keystrokes instead of the typical one " , said Ian . Apparently , in their codified language " props " means " I would love to eat from your sister ' s sexy hands " .
