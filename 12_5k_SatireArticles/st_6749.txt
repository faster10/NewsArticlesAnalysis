Witnesses said the robot , who was experiencing failing grades in the Arena and was said to be several thousand credits in debt , appeared to be under " great strain " at the time of the multiple robocide . The robot , one witness said , displayed an " almost mechanical lack of emotion " during the four and a half minute shooting spree , gunning down his fellow robots , as well as several fortified laser gun stations and a number of unmanned drones , with " inhuman " precision .
