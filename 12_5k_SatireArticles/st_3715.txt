" The X ' s and O ' s of it are pretty simple , " Johnson said , drawing up the play on his dry erase board . " Once Dwayne Wade passes the ball to Shaq down low , point guard Jason Terry will drop down to double team him and chop the backs of Shaq ' s legs , especially the femoral artery and the Achilles tendon , with his lighter machete . Dirk Nowitzki , while he ' s doing that , you will curl off your man and go for O ' Neal ' s collarbones with an overhand chopping motion of your Latin machete . By the third quarter , Shaq will have lost a significant amount of blood , and that ' s when Keith Van Horn and Josh Howard will be stabbing at O ' Neal ' s kidneys and the sensitive insides of his elbows with their respective weapons Van Horn with his Bolo Machete and Josh with his Double Edge Machete . Meanwhile , center DeSagana Diop , who I understand brought his own Panga Machete from home , will be carving O ' Neal ' s ribs . "
