The escapade , characterized by the ectoplasmic pair as " cockamamie " and " crazy ass bullshit , " began early last month , when the spirits of Knotts and Pryor separately took up residence at the old Mayweather place , a 20 room mansion that sits atop a hill on the edge of town . After a long and protracted episode in which the easily frightened ghosts circled the dining room , continually missing each other by a split second , they finally came face to face , only to mutually scream in horror .
