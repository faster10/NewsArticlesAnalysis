Davies would not elaborate on the exact look of the product , describing it only as " exactly what you thought a towel alarm clock would look like when you were a kid .

The clock mechanism automatically synchronizes itself with a signal sent from atomic clocks based in Colorado , guaranteeing an exceptional accuracy previously seen only in towel less timepieces . There is also a snooze button .
