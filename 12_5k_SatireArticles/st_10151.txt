After the fuss over alleged mishandling of the Katrina fiasco the government is taking pride in being prepared for this attack . Reliable witnesses have stated they have seen convoys hauling in additional non functioning vehicles , machinery and immigrants into the area so as to maximize the impact of the attack and to insure a steady flow of profits to our two courageous contractors . They are also reported to be hiring illegals to have in place a low cost expendable work force . It is the intention of this administration to prove to the country they are prepared .
