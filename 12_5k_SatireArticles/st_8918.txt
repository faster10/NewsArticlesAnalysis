' The difficulty with TCS is that it ' s a personality disorder , ' explained a representative of the UK Royal College of Psychiatrists . ' This means that the beliefs and attitudes involved are so integrated with the personal identities of sufferers that , firstly , they are unable to recognise that they ' re ill , and , secondly , there are no effective treatments . Medication is ineffective in treating personality disorders , ' she continued , ' and psychological interventions tend to have only limited effects in less severe cases . '
