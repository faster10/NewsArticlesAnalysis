In the meantime Supt Brownsword gave this statement " In the early hours of Sunday morning a gin soaked filth monger was senselessly attacked near the Ipswich Docks , the young woman known as Anna G was we believe distracted from behind by a mysterious stranger , as she turned to answer him she stepped into a massive Bum Cigar , after becoming trapped in the titanic log she was unable to escape and after several hours of screaming and struggling became rigid with shock . The stranger made good his escape towards the centre of Ipswich . I am appealing for calm , Poo related distraction attacks are thankfully rare , but I would urge caution if you , like Anna , enjoy pulling men near Ipswich Station after a filthy night of debauchery and hard liquor , you too could find yourseleves the victim of this perverted Logger .
