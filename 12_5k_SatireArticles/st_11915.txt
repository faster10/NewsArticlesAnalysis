Oh , I see , you ' re too busy with what ' s in that little pocket robot of yours . All full of phone calls , and important e mails and shit . You think I don ' t understand you ? You think I don ' t know what game you ' re playing ? You little attention skank . You love it . You ' re a flirt banker , and everyone ' s lining up to make a deposit . And you want me to think that you don ' t need any of it , that you ' ve got your big ole heels on , and your organic soy drink , and that you ' re good , you ' re " sufficient , and dudes like me don ' t exist . Well I ' ve got news for you honey . You can turn the other way , you can shrug it off , but everybody wants that shirt off .
