But getting restitution from the Lenape Indian Tribe might not be as easy for Manhattan as it was for The State of Florida in their case . The Lenape Indians have no casinos with which to pay off the three billion dollars in damages if they lose . We spoke with Chief Hyawocka , one of the few Lenape Indians left on his small reservation , which sits just north of Harlem . The reservation is basically an empty lot , strewn with broken glass , jammed in between two downtrodden buildings on 269th Street . " That twenty four dollars was gone a long time ago . " Chief Hyawocka explained from the sagging doorway of his old Winnebago . " I never got a piece of that money , not even one red cent . I got no way of paying Manhattan that kind of dough . " He told us gruffly .
