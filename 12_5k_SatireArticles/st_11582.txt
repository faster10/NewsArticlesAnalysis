During the trial , the friendship between the two boys had deteriorated . While Vandermeer was on the witness stand , court records show young Hamilton had several outbursts , at one point calling him a " stupid head and yelling at him to " stop saying lies with his fart breath , " at which Vandermeer said " you ' re the stupid head . I hate you . " causing Judge John Strathmore to give both boys a time out in the jury box while the rest of the court had apple juice and cookies during recess .
