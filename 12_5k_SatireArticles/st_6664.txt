" To our nation ' s EconoBudget citizens , I want to assure you that you will still get the same great service from your government that you always have , " Clinton said . " The postal delivery , the voting , the Social Security checks it ' s all still part of the basic citizenship package . And while , yes , a few certain special privileges will be off limits to you , that should in no way make you feel like a second class citizen . Remember , we are all Americans here , no matter how poorly or well we are treated . "
