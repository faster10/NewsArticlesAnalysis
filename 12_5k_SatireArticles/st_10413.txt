Sir Paul McCartney had no comment to either of the SONY statements other than to say , " Man , that ' s harsh ! " Paul did say , however , that he holds no ill will towards Michael for outbidding him for the Beatles collection in the first place . " Sure , it ' s my music and sure I ' m worth over 4 billion dollars and I ' m debt free and a freaking knight ! But , life is too short to hold a grudge , yesiree ! " McCartney ' s voice went shrill . But , Sir Paul is not above suspicion in the mysterious disappearance of Jackson ' s body . Showing off a new addition to his house dedicated to the late Michael Jackson , Paul was asked how he ' d like to remember the King of Pop . Paul smirked wickedly , pointed to a lit pedestal next to a skeletal display and remarked , " Right there , next the bones of the Elephant Man . "
