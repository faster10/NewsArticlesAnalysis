Eventually I started " typewriter busking " where folks would come just to watch me type on the pavement and toss me a nickel if I looked like I was typing real fast . I tell yeh , if I had a nickel for every nickel tossed my way , I would have er earned twice as much . I didn ' t need no Mavis Beacon to teach me my typing skills either . I had to type to live but that was okay coz I lived to type , you know what I ' m sayin ' . In fact once , some New York Big Shot Gangster threatened to " blow my brains out " if I stopped typing . Even after he ' d gone I kept on typing coz you just don ' t know guys like that could be waitin ' round the corner ready to pop a cap in your ass as soon as you stop typing , you know what I ' m sayin ' . You can ' t afford to let your guard down it ' s a doggy dog world for the professional typist " .
