Putin has been so down about the ' Putin PushBack ' that he has gone into a deep depression , feeling he has let down Stalin , his mentor . " Sure ! What I now do when Stalin is in mind and even in bed , so cannot sleep and I see him even doing that nasty business with lovely wife Lyudmila . I am disgrace . If were olden days , I be off to gulag for failing to kick asses in Georgia . And , what I need now ? Dumb Polaks and meesiles systemics . Give major break to me , pleese . If Poland is too rough , I must nuclear all Polaks and their pigs ! "
