" Voters need an incentive to get to the polls , " said potential contractor Fred Mitchelson of Accenture , formerly Arthur Andersen . " It ' s not like the old days when people were motivated by a sense of civic pride that ' s just too Waltons . We ' re in negotiations to partner with Best Buy . Under our plan , every voter would receive a coupon for 20 percent off any purchase up to 500 it would actually pay to go to the polls ! It ' d be great exposure for Best Buy and a fantastic opportunity for us to hit and exceed that magic six zero . Oh , and this whole registration thing has gotta go . "
