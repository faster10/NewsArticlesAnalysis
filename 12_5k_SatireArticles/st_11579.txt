" Calamities happened all the time throughout the 20th century , but since the 90s when Bono focussed on his ego and less on the music , he rose to take the mantel left by other humanitarian organisations , and so the world has been able to bring about rapid solutions and answers . Bono has made the world realise that it is not possible for organisations who are specialists in their region or area , to do this on their own or for world leaders to find solutions . It needs someone with fresh eyes and a natural touch to make things happen and join the dots . That man was and we hope will continue to be Bono . We ask the world to pray this week and hope that Bono ' s ego can be returned . "
