The Jesus comment was only the latest of Carson ' s recent statements on firearms . The retired neurosurgeon also faced criticism for statements he made on a SiriusXM radio show about a time he faced a gun in a Baltimore Popeye ' s restaurant . Carson recalled his Popeye ' s stickup experience during a Wednesday interview with Urban View host Karen Hunter . " I have had a gun held on me when I was in a Popeye ' s organization , " said Carson . " The guy comes in , put the gun in my ribs . And I just said , ' I believe that you want the guy behind the counter . ' " The Baltimore Police Department said it did not have enough information to confirm Carson ' s story . The Police Department explained on Twitter it had received " multiple media requests " in response to Carson ' s interview , but without a date and time they could not confirm its validity .
