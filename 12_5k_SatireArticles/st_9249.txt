As Taylor noted , " ' Alright ' never used to be a word , but because people kept writing ' alright ' instead of ' all right , ' now it ' s an accepted spelling . Same with the Caesar Salad . It ' s been alright with the American people for years . And it ' s more than alright with Kraft . So it was time to make it officially alright with the FDA . We ' re proud that the Caesar Salad is presently a health food , and I don ' t see that changing anytime soon . "
