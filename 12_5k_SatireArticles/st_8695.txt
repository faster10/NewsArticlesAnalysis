In a speech , clearly designed to appease the Conservative Right , Lord Cameron launched a blistering attack on the ' feckless poor ' . He stated " For too long now , the underclass in society have assumed the same rights as the slightly better off . We propose a financial cap on fertility rights to be set at two per cent above inflation . This is for the Nations and indeed , ultimately the poors ' benefit . Take American policies up until the mid nineteenth century , a clear example of Big Society in action . Thousands of people were kept out of abject poverty tending horses and picking cotton . This is compassionate conservatism at its best . "
