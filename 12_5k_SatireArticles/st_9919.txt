The other detainee who boarded the plane was Abdul Aziz Abdullah Ali al Suadi , a Yemeni who has resettled on Fire Island New York . David Remes , lawyer for Mr Suadi , said that it was an ideal place for him and he would probably fit in well . " He has a very affectionate Western sensibility , " Mr Remes said . " He looks European and when people pass him on the beach , they would probably solicit his thoughts on redecorating . " A task force recommended transferring Mr Suadi in 2009 , but lacking a functional airport in Yemen prevented that FOR SEVEN YEARS . The lawyer representing him , Erin Thomas , said Mr Suadi had become fluent in English at Guant namo and in 2014 enrolled in two correspondence college courses constitutional law and compositional English through a program for inmates run by Whatsamatta University in Truth or Consequences New Mexico . He had nearly completed both and was trying to figure out how to take final exams when NYC Mayor de Blasio offered to resettle him , she said . Mr Suadi has also been retained as chief advisor and campaign finance chairman to Mr Bwazir ' s bid for the Oval Office . Go to BWAZIRnotBrassiere4PREZ . org
