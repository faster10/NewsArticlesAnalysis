" My husband is a teacher at University Of Michigan and a friend of his , a chemistry professor at UNM in Albuquerque , wanted to pay us to send them weekly samples for their own testing and teaching . After that , on a lark , I listed samples on Ebay and they immediately sold . I told my sister about it and pretty soon we had used up all of the empty water bottles we had selling on eBay , and our family was going through 200 bottles of water a week . "
