The United Nations will conduct a search of Mr Powell ' s estate beginning next Monday . The former secretary of defense resigned from his cabinet position nearly a month ago . He could not be reached yesterday and has not returned phone calls . A preliminary search of his office in his New Jersey home turned up no evidence of nukes , but federal agents said they found blue pills imprinted with the word " pfizer " , along with a bag of white powder . Both were sent to pharmaceutical laboratories at UCLA .
