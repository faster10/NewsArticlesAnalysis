Now hold on for just a cotton pickin ' second here . Going on this train of crazy logic killing rhinos to save rhinos isn ' t that sort of like asking starving people to go on a long fast to fight hunger ? Let ' s say , each emaciated and sickly victim already knocking on death ' s door is obliged to summon up a whole litany of supporters , with each supporter vowing to chip in 5 a day for each 24 hour fast ? Whoopy dogs ! Let ' s all us under the bridge indigents just get 500 supporters each , starve for another month , then we can all eat at that fancy shmansy seafood restaurant with the big blue fish as its marquee symbol every day for a year ! This scheme having starving people starve themselves even more just to feed themselves after it ' s all over sounds like something some power and attention hungry Republican Congressional hopeful would go on record as saying , doesn ' t it ? Just the fallout from all the controversy would make this political contender an instant celebrity , an instant household name , and an election day shoe in , especially in a bleeding red state like Texas ! Haven ' t the likes of Mitch McConnell , Mike Huckabee , Michelle Bachmann and Sarah Palin come up with similar batshit crazy and dangerous proposals ?
