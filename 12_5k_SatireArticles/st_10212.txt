The Governator ' s office was contacted for comment . Unfortunately his representative said he was down for repairs . However , he denied all allegations that he was a " girly man " on this issue . Although this reporter is pretty sure he was spotted wearing his wife ' s fuchsia robe with a " very respectable feather boa " tiptoeing through the capitol tulips . . . In high healed shoes . . . Singing Helen Reddy ' s , " I am woman hear me roar ! . " Not gay , just girly .
