At approximately 2 p . m . , Bogen , who had slept way late after a night of hard partying , woke up and identified the individual on the couch as " Ryan from Stowe , " this guy he used to work with like two or three summers ago . Bogen said he would have mentioned to Thatcher that the guy would be crashing at their apartment , but he had been clueless himself until the guy showed up from out of nowhere at around 9 the night before . " We used to park cars together I think it was summer of ' 96 , " said Bogen , who noted that he hadn ' t thought about the guy in forever . " He was in town , so he stopped by to say hi . The dude said he was planning to drive back to Stowe last night , but we spent all night out at the bars , so he wound up sacking out on the couch . "
