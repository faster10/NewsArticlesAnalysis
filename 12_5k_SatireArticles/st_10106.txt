Reportedly , the money was sent on C 130 planes from the US . As some of you may be aware , the C 130s entered American Air Force service in 1959 . Since the planes were almost 45 years old at the time of this shipment , and also due to the large size of the shipment , they burnt more fuel than they could carry . As a result they had to stop for refueling on the Isle of Scilly , not Silly , off the southwestern shores of UK .
