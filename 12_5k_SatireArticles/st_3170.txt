" We got pretty out of control there with the endowing , " said foundation president Jonathon Fanton , icing down his check writing hand while recovering Monday . " It started Friday afternoon , when Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Lyn Hutton suggested we give a grant to the Foundation for Urban Renewal for their tireless efforts to rebuild America ' s struggling inner cities . Then , Treasurer Marc Yanchura said Save Our Cities was doing even better work , so we threw them on the pile , too . Things kind of snowballed from there , and by 4 a . m . , we ' d given 81 million in grants to 16 different groups . I think we even gave a few million to rival philanthropic organization Pew Charitable Trusts . "
