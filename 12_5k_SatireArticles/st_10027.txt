Civil unrest has erupted in the small town of Sandwich , Massachusetts after a slew of incidents in which the white population was being given the same treatment as its minority residents . The trouble began late Tuesday afternoon after a troubling episode following a routine traffic violation . Steven Salsbury , 35 , was driving home from the bar that evening when he was pulled over for reckless driving . The ensuing events resulted in Salsbury being asked to exit the car , and even consent to a pat down and vehicle inspection .
