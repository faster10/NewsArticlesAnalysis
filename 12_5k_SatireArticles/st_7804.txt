Adam famously attended Mount Camel High School , where he learned how to mount a camel while being high . He quickly learned to enjoy mounting the camel while high and was very good at it very quickly . Unfortunately , he was unable to graduate from Mount Camel High . Despite frequently mounting the camel ( who he got very close to and named " Humphries " , after his favourite gay icon John Inman who played outrageously gay character Mr Humphries in British 70s sitcom Are You Being Served ? ) , Adam never learned to ride it , and so was unable to graduate .
