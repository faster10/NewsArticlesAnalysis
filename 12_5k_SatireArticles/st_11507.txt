There has also been some inter debating between North Korea and Iran . Iran believes it should have extra veto power due to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad being a relative of Ruhollah Khomeini ( who is has been described as the mother teresa of the middle east due to his involvement in the Iranian revolution which changed the lives of so many Iranians for the better and constant charitable acts such as going to orphanages and asking children to draw a portrait of him to increase their art ability ) . Ruhollah Khomeini also established the Tehran convention which includes rules and regulations of war .
