Intrigued , we confronted Manuel to get his side of the story . " Look , my friends know a lot about some of me , like how I enjoy sleeping on self knitted baby arms every night so I can be ' held by the future ' as it were , but they don ' t know all of me , " said Manuel . " My friends will tell you about the Manuel who gives his coworkers rides to work in nice cars , but they won ' t tell you about Da Man who steals those cars and wins street races ! My colleagues know those stories . " Prior to hanging up on us , he said that his friends " need to wake up , smell the proverbial coffee , and understand that he is multidimensional and envied by most at the office . "
