" In what was probably our most telling experiment , we positioned two 5 foot 10 inch tall male subjects opposite one another at a distance of approximately 800 feet , " said Pinard . " We found that , though appearing no more than 4 centimeters in size to their respective counterpart , each subject remained at their original height of 5 feet and 10 inches at all times . In the next phase of the trial , the subjects began walking toward each other , and again , the results indicated that they were not growing taller and taller at exponential rates with every step , but instead once again remained at a constant height of 5 feet and 10 inches , with absolutely no variation in physical stature .
