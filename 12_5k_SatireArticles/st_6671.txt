According to police documents , Potter told investigators he was working late at his office Sunday night when , around 11 : 30 p . m . , he heard the sound of a loud muffler and rock music coming from outside USPS headquarters . Potter said he ran outside to see what was happening , but by the time he arrived the teens were speeding off down a gravel road , giving him only enough time to throw a crab apple at the departing car , which he described as " a rusted out old Buick .
