They don ' t want big government , they don ' t want socialistic policies and they don ' t want to spend more money for things they don ' t need . They don ' t want national debt piling upon more national debt to finace programs and give a ways that don ' t work . They don ' t see Washington as Robin Hood , robbing the rich to help the poor , but as the Sheriff of Nottingham taking their tax money and giving it to big business while we starve .
