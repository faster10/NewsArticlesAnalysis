" Look , I was taught by the nuns and , sure , they could go a little overboard with the switch sometimes , but it was a good , thorough education , with none of this weirdo stuff , " Kramarczyk said . " I had to drop out of the ninth grade to support the family , but I knew the three Rs up and down . All these kids know how to do is play autoharps and grow bean plants . That ain ' t education to me . I don ' t know what it is , but it ain ' t education . "
