The second of the crew to be found was Sam Kim who was shot in the head from a high powered . 50 caliber rifle . At the time of the shooting , Mr Kim was driving up a hill on a back road , not far from his home only a couple of miles away from Marcus Reign . The shooter fired a single round , through the passenger side glass , killing Sam Kim . Taking into account the damage done to Mr Kims ' skull and the angle from which the shot had to have been fired , the shooter was at least 150 yards away . In any direction , there is nothing other than trees meaning that this sniper fired a shot , on a dark night , in the woods , that passed through the glass in a moving car and hit his target with incredible accuracy .
