On stage dancer at the gig in Central Park said this : " This annoying guy who didn ' t even like Beiber , he kept following us everywhere . When we went to England and Europe , he was there , when we went to the Nevada desert he was there . In fact , we sent a life like dummy of him Beiber to Antartica , and boom ! He was there ! It ' s nice to see that he has got over the bullying taunts of this guy and punched him in the face . "
