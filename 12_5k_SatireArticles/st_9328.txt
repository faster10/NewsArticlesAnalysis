Taking time to address the gathered children directly , Garder also wanted to make clear that a now permanent state of paranoia about terrorism and Islam was also a very recent development in Western society . " It ' s true , kids , as you may have read , that ' terrorism ' used to be considered an evil political maneuver and not a sentient , singular ideology against which a prolonged war could possibly accomplish anything . Yes , there was a time when the fear of being blown up by a foreign radical was held on par with getting eaten by a hippo . We ' re sorry that ' s not the world we ' re leaving you , but always remember that you can mold the world in whatever way you see fit . It will be up to you to leave the world in a better shape for your children than we left it for you . Don ' t feel beholden to our mistakes . "
