Another inmate by the name of Earl Smith said that James was such a generous man , and he didn ' t know why people thought he would mistreat people . " He ' s such an inspiring man . He stays at the prison 24 7 passing out his candies and makes sure the prisoners don ' t get poisoned by eating their food and throwing it away so they don ' t die . If that ' s not a giving man , then I don ' t know what is , " said Earl .
