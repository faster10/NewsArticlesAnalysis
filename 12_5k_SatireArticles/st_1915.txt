" I ' ve made some choices I ' m not proud of , " said the newly liberated Doswell . " When you ' re in wedlock , you have to do things you never thought you would , make friends with people you would have never made friends with on the outside , shop at a Pottery Barn . But after wasting almost half my life on baptisms and birthday parties meant for some other man , I ' m not about to take my single life for granted anymore . "
