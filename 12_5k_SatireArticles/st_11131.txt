Another disturbing aspect of the image is that it shows two skulls . This reporter asked Kandra Mann , head of radiology at UNM in Albuquerque NM , to review the x ray image and we also asked her to determine if it may help corroborate previous reporting on an incident in which a second head emerged from Trump ' s Jacket and started shouting during a press briefing in NH . Without addressing the merits of our previous story , she stated " I can only say this : the likelihood of having two heads both with microcephaly is extremely remote . " Mann went on to say , " While both skulls show clear signs of diminished development , I can only speculate that the presence of the second skull is an artifact of the individual TSA scanning device or software associated with it .
