New York , New York The latest to jump on the treadmill of dieting books that Americans just cannot seem to get enough of these days , J . K . Rowling has surprised everyone with her recent announcement that she has sent her latest completed literary work to her publisher . Copies of the new dieting book are soon to hit the shelves in bookstores all across American as early as next month however , not without controversy . The main criticism is that J . K . Rowling is dumbing down the title for release into the American market like she did with her first Harry Potter book titled : ' Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone ' in England . But then re titled it for release in the American market as , ' Harry Potter and the Sorcerer ' s Stone ' .
