Mar . 2 : We had another visitor today . A woman came to the cave entrance . She said her name was Mary something or other and odffered to give everyone in the cavehold something called a " makeover . " Just then Hassim came up behind me to see who was at the door . Mary Whatever Her Name Was took one look at Hassim , screamed , fell over backwards and rolled down the cliff . I am not sure but I believe this is because Hassim has not shaved or practiced any sort of personal hygiene for the last several months . even the goats and camel will not go near hm anymore . But for this one time I am thankful .
