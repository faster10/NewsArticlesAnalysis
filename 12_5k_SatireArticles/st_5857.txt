" Someone ' s going to lunge for it , " said a black crappie , speaking for members of the river ' s large Pomoxis nigromaculatus population . " What we are seeing now is a contest between patience and curiosity . We ' re enraptured , frankly . Is it the shininess , like unto the scales of a smaller fish ? Or the flickering , recalling the wings of a struggling beetle ? Perhaps it ' s those baffling silver extensions , glinting so in the light . What are they ? And , then , of course , there is the wriggling . The wriggling ! Like a helpless , flailing tadpole , when you have him in your mouth , and you experience that delicious moment when he still might get away . "
