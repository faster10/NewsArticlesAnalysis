" I understand that some may be uncomfortable with this attack on Governor Romney ' s personal beliefs , and to that I say , ' Excuse me ? ' I still have to keep apologizing for knowing one minister who said some inflammatory things about American foreign policy . One guy . It wasn ' t like the every Baptist minister on the planet teaches that crap . But yes , every Mormon before 1978 believed that about blacks . Until they got a ' divine revelation ' to stop doing so , which conveniently came around the time African Americans gained widespread social acceptance . "
