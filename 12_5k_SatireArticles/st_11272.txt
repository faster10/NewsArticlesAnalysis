Feb . 26 : I have been very busy with making plans , dear diary , and have been neglecting you . Akmed has the curtains up and I must admit it does help a little . It takes a heap of living to make a cave a home , if I may coin a phrase . And this place IS a heap . I have been working with the inner circle to make more plans for disrupting the West . This is not easy since all that is left of the inner circle is my own esteemed self , Hassim , Akmed , 2 goats and a chicken . The chicken is a recent addition . She came to the cave entrance the other and said she was looking for work since she had recently lost her job in a place called Oh High Oh . At the very least it will be nice to have some one intelligent to talk to .
