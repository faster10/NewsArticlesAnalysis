Ashley ' s father Steve admitted he had a problem with his daughter ' s choice . " For starters I thought it was going to be bigger , " he said . " She also got the wrong font , a nice helvetica or arial would have been much easier to read . And don ' t get me started on how much she paid . If I ' ve told her once I ' ve told her a thousand times : always negotiate . Its actually downright embarrassing to me that she paid retail price . "
