Should Rafa take to the classifieds , one of the big names who might be interested in the job is reported to be Jose Mourinho , current manager at Stamford Bridge , or ' Chelski ' to club faithful . " There aren ' t any bigger clubs in terms of history in the English Premier League , " Mourinho was quoted as saying to our undercover ex KGB informant on the Chelski payroll . " I have always admired Rafa from afar , and his squad rotation system is one of the few successful ones . I also tried to do the same a few years back , but Joe Cole and Salomon Kalou were the only players I could rotate . I just didn ' t have enough of a transfer budget to buy any good players . " said the man who spent upwards of forty million Euro on veteran Ukrainian Andriy Shevchenko .
