' That ' s okay . I forgive you . . . . . But for calling me an " idiot " I command you to lash yourself a dozen times each morning as you pray towards the World Bank until further notice . It ' s only fair . I will have a special Opus Dei whip sent to you . Used to belong to Tony Blair and before that to Hermann Goering . And before that . . . to Red Pollard , jockey of the immortal Seabiscuit . It is true what they say Recep , . . . " little jockeys have big whips " . I ' ll sign it so that you can sell it some day on Ebay . "
