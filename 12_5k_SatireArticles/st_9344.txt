Mrs Obama responded with great delight , " Oh , what a great idea . I absolutely love waffles , and nobody likes waffles or does waffles better than Barack . He seems especially fond of something I think he calls wafflebot . I am not sure what that is , but I am pretty certain it must be bad for him . In any case , waffles are in his wheelhouse , and so is Big Bird . And I think he might be planning a new waffle recipe right now " .
