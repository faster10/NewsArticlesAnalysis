" I ' ve done movies before , but it was time to something serious . I would like to be a serious actress , my tweenyboper clean cut image is lovely and all but I am 20 years old now , not 15 , not 14 . So Burning Star is a whole new journey for me and I hope that my fans enjoy this . Other mentally disturbed characters will be doing a small scene where this is shown , there is a clean version of the movie , with out this which will be shown in cinemas everywhere . "
