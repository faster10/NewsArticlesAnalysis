" The story Dinner With Georgia O ' Keefe ? I completely made up every detail . I never met her . Hell , I ' ve never even been to Santa Fe . Dinner With Einstein ? Again , completely made up . Einstein had been dead for decades before I sat down at my laptop and wrote it . Dinner With Harley Davidson ? Mr Davidson had been dead for about a century before I wrote that story . I don ' t even own a motorcycle . "
