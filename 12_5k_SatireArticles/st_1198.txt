" QuikShot lets anyone with a credit card walk up to one of our street side firearm stations , select a gun , and head out into the Windy City fully armed in just a few seconds , " program director Arvind Reynolds told reporters , noting that borrowers can either rent their weapon for increments of 30 minutes or withdraw it for a full 24 hours if they plan on using it throughout the day . " With QuikShot , you and your friends can each take a Beretta up to Wrigley Field , or you can head to an outdoor concert in Millennium Park with a concealed 9mm revolver , or you can simply take in the great view of the Magnificent Mile from the roof deck of the Hancock tower through a scoped sniper rifle . The possibilities are truly endless with QuikShot . "
