" As governor of Texas , Bush fought tirelessly to protect the state ' s subterranean environment through a series of massive petrochemical deposit clean up projects , " Secretary of the Interior Gale A . Norton said . " Under his governorship , more tons of petroleum based subterranean environmental contaminants were removed in Texas than in all the national Superfund clean up sites combined . The Democrats talk a good game about the importance of cleaning up the environment , but when it comes to actually eliminating the threat of enormous oil deposits lurking under the surface of our nation , no one can hold a candle to George W . Bush . "
