Suspicions are one thing the government are keen to avoid . Leaked documents show that there is no increased health benefits from increasing fruit and veg intake , and that the whole five portions scam was put in place in the hope that people would fail to get to the required number , and the health service could point to this as to the reason why they are getting cancer or heart disease , obesity or type two diabetes . With people managing the five a day , suspicions are beginning to be aroused . The ultimate aim , according to a Health and Safety insider , is to deny people access to health care who have not managed to prove that they eat the required number of portions of fruit and veg a day , saving the economy billions .
