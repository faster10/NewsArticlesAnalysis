The main star of the culture committee , five times Open golf winner and current Labour MP Tom Watson , reckons that today is an historic day . He said , " I may of won eight majors in my golf career but this surpasses all of that . Mr Murdoch and his company have displayed that they cannot be trusted to operate such a large media company . Christ , I wouldn ' t even trust them to caddy for me . Never again shall any individual or company be able to exercise such power over political figures and the police . "
