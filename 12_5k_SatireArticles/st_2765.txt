" Jerry had all his pitches working today : the fastball , the slowball , the ball that starts fast and then slows down right before it reaches the plate , and the breaking pitch that starts down the middle and then slowly curves 15 feet outside as the batter begins his swing , " Hershiser said . " His pitch sequences were set up beautifully . He did a great job of throwing pitches inside to make the batter stand in the far corner of the batter ' s box , and then coming back with a fastball that painted the outside corner . Worked every time . "
