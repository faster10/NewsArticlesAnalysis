For those of you that missed it , some of this year ' s good times included : getting dressed up in fat suits and fighting like sumo wrestlers , watching a hypnotist make a girl believe she was Britney Spears , and getting really wasted at the engineering party at Fort York . I thought I was going to go blind I was so wasted ! I downed eight beers in the first hour and that was pretty good considering how much I pre drank at Jamie Mitchell ' s house party .
