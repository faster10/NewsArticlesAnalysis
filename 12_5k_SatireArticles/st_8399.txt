If you watch the video , it gets strange right at the outset . Casebolt takes off sprinting after a kid who ' s a half a block away , and during this run , Cacebolt does an aikido roll on the grass , lands back on his feet and keeps flying as fast as his corn fed legs will allow . Wow , I thought , Is this guy for real ? Is Bruce Lee returning from the dead to fight another gallant battle with this Casebolt super duper trooper ?
