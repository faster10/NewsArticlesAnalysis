" You ' re shitting me , right ? An attorney , up in Pennsylvania , in his or her right mind , is claiming Casey Anthony , a woman who never had an original thought in her head , is an Illuminati . Not to mention Anthony hasn ' t a penny to her name , and yet someone is suing her for 3 billion ? And that woman , Naomi Riches , is still out on the loose ? They haven ' t put her in a strait jacket yet ? "
