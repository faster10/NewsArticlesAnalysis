The first stretch of motorway past the town was the A48 ( M ) which is now the M4 , and was constructed in the 1960s as an elevated section . Many families had to move out of their houses and relocate within the town to make way for this . Since then the town has moved on and so has its industry so the time has come for the town to have a change from its history of being the pollution capital of Wales with its steelworks and nearby coal mining to taking advantage of other natural resources beneath the surface of the earth .
