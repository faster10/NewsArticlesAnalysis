I have observed over the years a despondency with some of our parishioners when their prayers have failed them . Sometimes they prayed for rain and got snow . Some have prayed to win the big Lotto Jackpot , only to do so , and find they have lost the winning ticket . Others pray they catch a fish and come home empty handed except they stop at the fish store and buy a bass or flounder , so they can tell their wives and kids they were successful and proceed with a whopper of a fish story .
