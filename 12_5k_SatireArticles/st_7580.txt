" I ' m really concerned for the mortality of my old co stars Frank Thornton ( 86 ) and Peter Sallis ( 88 ) " mutters Lewis . " June Whitfield and Jean Alexander are no spring chickens either . " he added . " We had Norman Wisdom in one episode and look at what ' s since happened to him . . . he ' s in a home on the Isle of Man suffering from senility . . . poor old Norman . . . "
