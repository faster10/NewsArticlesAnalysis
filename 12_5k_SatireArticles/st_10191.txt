Party Vice Chairman Howard Dean reflected this when he said , " Everyone still remembers " Billary " and hates that steel dike bitch , and Obama keeps blowing himself up . That leaves us Edwards , who has a bad rap as Kerry ' s running mate , gets 400 Hollywood haircuts , and wants to ignore his dying wife and kids . Next , we ' ve got Bill Richardson . New Mexico would vote for him just to get rid of the man just because he ' s been a terrible governor , but that is only 5 electoral votes . "
