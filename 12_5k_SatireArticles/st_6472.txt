" Often I ' d wake up at six in the morning and Evan would already be downstairs moving around , thinking about things , experiencing continuous reality , and responding to external stimuli , " said Paula Laskin , adding that her son had covered the walls of his bedroom with posters of living people he idolized . " Even as a toddler , he talked about how much he wanted to be alive , to have functioning organs and measurable brain activity . You could tell just by being around him that Evan ' s calling in life was to be a living human being . "
