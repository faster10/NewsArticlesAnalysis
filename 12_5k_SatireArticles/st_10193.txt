The cruise ship was packed with surfers and other adventurous types and certainly this trip is not for everyone . One of the highlights of the trip includes being tied 200 feet high up on special masts . Large velcro devices secure the passenger against the padded mast . The ride gets wild as the ship tosses and turns its way right through the eye wall of the hurricane and enters into the calm of the eye where the skies are actually blue and the sun shines . At that point the folks on the masts return to the lower deck and new passengers cling the mast for their turn through the opposite eye wall and finally the ship emerges out of the opposite side of the storm . It takes twelve or more hours to get through the whole storm . They wear special goggles with small windshield wipers for protection and visibility . Some of the waves on this trip approached 60 feet or about 20 meters in height .
