" Before Anszczak , the individual was represented as part of a whole , " wrote Kleiff , ' 78 . " What ' s missing from Anszczak ' s work is a sense of community , of people mutually sharing a social and educational experience . Is it any coincidence that he and suburbia mushroomed together ? Like the white picket fence around a single story frame home , the white borders in Anszczak ' s composite photos serve to separate , to isolate , to detach . At their worst , they promote narcissism and insularity . "
