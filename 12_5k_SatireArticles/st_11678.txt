After years of travelling across this country we call Canada , from coast to coast to coast , I have seen many things that have amazed me . The lofty mountains of the Rockies , the vast prairies , the Great Lakes that stretch from Superior to Ontario , the St . Lawrence and the endearing Maritimes . For years , I have heard and enjoyed the stories from folks across the land . But your town ruins absolutely everything I know and admire about this nation and and the people who call it home . God , how I hate and resent your small , pathetic town .
