" First , a shout out to Former Grambling State College Coach Eddie Robinson for moving to the top of the list in college football wins with 408 after the NCAA took 112 wins away from Coach Paterno after absentee ballots were recounted ! I know the Robinson family , and I include my wife , my mother in law and my brother in law , are proud to carry the Robinson name even though they are not remotely related , as far as I know . I wish Eddie could be here today to celebrate with me , Michelle , Marion and Craig , but unfortunately Eddie , uh , I think , uh died in 2007 , but the Robinson name will now live on with us !
