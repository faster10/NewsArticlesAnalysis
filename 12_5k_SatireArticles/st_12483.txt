We Democrats are sick and tired of Republicans constantly using the Constitution to cover up their true plans , which are to make us all afraid of everyone else . Our great president came from a civilized part of the country where there is strict gun control , and he is only trying to bring the benefits of that more modern way of living to the rest of us . I don ' t know the exact statistics , but I ' m quite certain that Chicago is alot safer than Charleston when it comes to gun violence .
