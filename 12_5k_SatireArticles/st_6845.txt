The owner of one of Shady Lane ' s two tony northern properties sees no cause for panic in the statistics . " As we say in my industry , a rising tide lifts all ships , " said Henry Humphries , a shipping magnate worth an estimated 750 million . " It just takes some time , that ' s all . Look , I made 45 million last year , and I bought all my executives BMWs . Would I have liked to have bought them Rolls Royces ? Of course . But I have to acquire other companies with that money so I can continue to make money so that they can continue to make money . That ' s what makes the world go around . "
