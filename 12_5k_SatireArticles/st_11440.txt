" That brings me to my main announcement , " said Pachauri , turning to gesture to a portrait of him by Chuck Close that sat on a stand close by . Close , a noted American photorealist artist famous for his " Close Ups " of chiefly ugly and nondescript persons , which he manages to make even more repulsive , has painted such notables as former president Bill Clinton , whose portrait , " Slick Willy No . 2 , " now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington , and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , whose visage is now on exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Contemporary Art . Close ' s meticulous rendering of her , called " Bitch Witch from Macbeth , " is on temporary loan from the Arianna Huffington Collection .
