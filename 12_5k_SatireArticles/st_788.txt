Though Affleck , who offered to write the script for free , anticipates more lengthy scenes of dialogue than is typical for a Bourne film , he promised the movie would not be without its signature fight sequences . Affleck said he had already storyboarded one scene , set at a Boston Red Sox game , in which Bourne , the sidekick , and another high school friend , played by director Kevin Smith , get into a fast paced drunken argument over the film Star Wars and each of their respective mothers .
