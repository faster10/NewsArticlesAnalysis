" Should the goode Lorde see fit , I shall now expunge upon the question that is known chiefly as the birde . Namely is it THE word or merely a word ? The foole hath said in his heart ' there is no bird ' and yet howe else do we give accout for the marrvellous taile of an horse which swiseth verily to keep away the vile fly and the tastey goodnesse of quaker porridge , composyed of three various varieties of quakers ? Hold ye fast to this notion for sooth indeed the word beith the bird . "
