" Tommorow I could be looking for work , you know ? " he said , wiping away a tear , " I have a family , kids and commitments . It could be today , next week or a month from now , but that doesn ' t make it any easier . Sooner or later I will be on the scrapheap . A forgetten man . The chances of me getting a job here in Carmel are doubtful . Apart from Mr Eastwood there is absolutely no one who needs a butler . Full time at least . "
