" Soda of the variety Mr Turnbee is talking about costs Burger King approximately 3 cents per gallon and is sold at a 25 , 000 percent markup , " fast food industry analyst Wilson Anderson said . " Thus , when Mr Turnbee purchases a 16 ounce cup for 94 cents and refills it three times , he is not actually getting a significantly better value than the consumer who does not refill at all . In fact , he would have to drink more than 250 refills to get his 94 cents ' worth . "
