When asked why it was necessary to route the particles through thousands of home computers , worldwide , Dr Evans explained that increasing the length of the ring would allow particles to slow down . ' The proton collisions in the LHC occur at 99 . 9 the speed of light , ' he explained , ' and so any Higgs bosons that fly off are travelling pretty dammed fast . It makes the little buggers virtually impossible to catch , even using butterfly nets with the very finest mesh . We almost got one in March 2011 , ' he confessed , ' but someone had left the laboratory door open , and we think it got out that way . '
