Another phase of the ASSASSINS Program will involve testing the latest in medical technology . " With all the school shootings going on all over the country , we ' ve decided to set up military M . A . S . H . Units in a number of high school parking lots , " stated King . " That way , if any of our courageous kids are wounded , we ' ll be able to treat them right away , decreasing the risk of permanent injury or death . Nothing is too good for the kids we sucker in ahh I mean recruit into this program . Again , this is a big win win for everyone : the military will be able to train new medics in the field , and the students will see , first hand , what this world has in store for them when they reach adulthood .
