" Mom said if I didn ' t invite Jessica , I couldn ' t have the party , " Prentiss said . " I was like , ' Mom , Jessica and I haven ' t been friends since second grade ! ' but she wouldn ' t listen . I couldn ' t tell her that nobody ' s friends with Jessica anymore because she ' s such a dork . It ' s embarrassing enough that everybody knows we used to be friends , but then I had to actually have her at my sleepover . "
