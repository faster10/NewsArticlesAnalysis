For many years the AMA has been arguing that a monopoly in health care is to the benefit of GPs and patients . They argue that it helps by keeping out those who do not agree with AMA policies . Since all GPs must belong to the AMA to practice , and non medically qualified people cannot be members , there has never been any opposition to this policy . The AMA has always argued that a monopoly keeps the cost down and makes the best treatment available to everyone .
