David last week spent at least 90 minutes of kicking a ball round a field , just to earn a piddly and pathetic 4 , 000 , 000 GBP . He complains that it takes another 20 minutes of his time to go down the bank and pay it into his account , plus he has to pay 5 pounds in petrol money to get to the bank from the pitch , plus 1 . 50 GBP to buy a parking ticket for his crappy old Ferrrari that is only worth about 250 , 000 GBP at a push and is at least 6 months old and now has a 2 millimetre scuffle on the wing mirror . He would like to tow this car down the scrapyard and buy another 1 without this minor scuffle , but says he just cannot afford to do this on the piddly wages he earns on a football game .
