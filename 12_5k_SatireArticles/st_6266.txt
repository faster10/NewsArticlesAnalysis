" No one and I mean no one in class likes them , " the 33 year old teacher said . " Sometimes I just want to sit the two of them down and say , ' Look , Paul , you ' re a spaz , and Wes , you ' re a spaz , too . You have no other choice here . If you don ' t want to sit by yourself every recess or endure the constant bullying all alone , you ' re going to have to buddy up . ' How have they not figured this out ? After all , they ' re weird , not dumb . "
