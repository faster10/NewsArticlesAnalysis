A hazardous waste incinerator that burns nuclear waste at a rate of 24 7 , 365 days a year is the keystone player in the local economy . It belches out half baked , refried and re dyed atomic pollution like the Grand Coulee Dam churns out water . Remnants of the half live breakdowns of Technetium , Francium , Radon , Actinium , Neptunium , and Einsteinium fill the atmosphere . So if you visit The Gateway of Death , it ' s best to bring along a gas mask retrofitted to filter out atomic air pollution . The air you breathe smells and tastes like Mustard Gas with a sprinkling of cyanide and arsenic . Four smokestacks pointing up to a black hole sun tower in the air like skyscrapers . A more primitive people would see these gigantic spiraling monstrosities and most likely fall down on their knees in worship . Yah yah , Hey yah , Yah yah , Hey , Hey , hey ya hey ya , is what they ' d most likely chant .
