Earl Bunsom , a Tubac cattle hand and self proclaimed expert on El Chupacabra movements , has been searching for the Goat Sucker for twelve years . " I left my job in Los Angeles about twelve years ago after El Chupy killed my cat Butch in the middle of the night . I heard Butch crying and ran into the storage room where he slept and saw glowing red eyes staring at me and Butch ' s blood dripping from that bastard ' s mouth . I tried saving Butch , but I was too late and vowed to kill all those damn Goat Suckers . "
