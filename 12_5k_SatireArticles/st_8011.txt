David Mersch , recalling the " glow " he had personally seen on a guided tour of one such cave , had a brilliant idea . So , through a " university to university " international swap grant , the New Zealand government allowed the exportation of a dozen or so live Glow Worms in exchange for one campus Starbucks . He went to work on his idea . In a school laboratory over the next six months he raised a small worm farm , and procured several road kill " orphaned " fawns for test specimens .
