" Sure as shootin ' , I got caught with my drawers down , " said Laramie , tipping back his battered Stetson hat with a leathery forefinger . " The economy was good and spooked . Bucked some , she did , sunfished all over on me and plumb near threw her bit , and she might be running still if I ' d have loosened up the banking regulations the way the House Republicans wanted . But that ' s no way to do it , no sir . You got to set tight and let this stuff play itself out till it ' s winded , or you got yourself a case of the damn runaway inflation . And no way to bring it back . "
