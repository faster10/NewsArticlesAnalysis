It remains to be seen whether this " broad " side from on high will send Catholic women fleeing the church in droves . In the past , they have faithfully come back for more regardless of the abuse their male priests have heaped upon them in their sermons . John Paul ' s bull appears unconcerned about a possible backlash . " Catholic women are the sheep and the Church is their shepherd . It is ludicrous to believe that sheep will ever be elevated to the position of caring for the flock . That task is clearly reserved for human beings . It is equally ludicrous to predict that the sheep will some day abandon their shepherd . Such a display of initiative and independence would be contrary to the nature of sheep and women . "
