I noticed that the shadows began to lengthen , and the sky to bruise . Pleasant as it was to be sitting outside a converted badger sett in the gloaming of a Dorking Spring , I was , as ever , conscious of time and deadlines . I pushed the Professor , who is the Visiting Egregious Professor of Hyperbolic Spasm Technology Infinite Numinastic Modelling at the University of Dorking , for some results . It was time to cut to the chase , basically , or there would be no story , and this girl reporter would be back on the WI News and Mole Valley FM Highlights of The Day .
