" If the Cubs have a man on third and don ' t score , he starts screaming ' You suck , you suck ! ' over and over , " said Wrigley Field security guard Eric Brodeur . " Sometimes he ' ll just start acting up for no reason , like when he ' ll yell ' Take him out ! ' about our starting pitcher in the third inning . But then he usually stops abruptly and just sits back down , totally silent , for the rest of the game . "
