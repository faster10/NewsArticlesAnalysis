In a challenge to the authority of the Federal government to require State and Local Law Enforcement to enforce Federal Law ( Printz v United States ) the U . S . Supreme Court rendered a decision in 1997 . For the majority opinion Justice Scalia wrote : " . this Court never has sanctioned explicitly a federal command to the States to promulgate and enforce laws and regulations When we were at last confronted squarely with a federal statute that unambiguously required the States to enact or administer a federal regulatory program , our decision should have come as no surprise . . It is an essential attribute of the States ' retained sovereignty that they remain independent and autonomous within their proper sphere of authority . "
