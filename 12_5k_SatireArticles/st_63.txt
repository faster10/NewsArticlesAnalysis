" Our bosses say nothing is ever going to replace old fashioned , hands on legislation , but I have my doubts , " said a Michigan representative speaking on condition of anonymity . " As it stands , we only have a few seconds to look over the bill before putting it in the machine to vote or amend . If we try to take a closer look , DeLay gets on our ass about holding up the line . I don ' t want to pass shoddy legislation , but I don ' t want to lose my job , either . "
