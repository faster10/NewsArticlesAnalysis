Teetotaler Phil Mickelson said , " My hats off to the lads , most of the time they ' re basically just 3 sheets to the wind , which fits the nature of golf in this part of the world . They ' re so relaxed the pressure never gets to ' em , and they ' re a good natured lot when they drink before the match . . . . not a nasty drunk amongst ' em , I don ' t care what John Daly says ! "
