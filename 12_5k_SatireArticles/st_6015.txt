" Red Lobster ' s corporate values have always been directly aligned with the interests of the traditional American family , and that means we are vigorously opposed to the female infiltration of the workplace , " said Clarence Otis Jr . , CEO of Red Lobster ' s parent company Darden Restaurants Inc . , and a self described " die hard opponent " of the women ' s rights movement . " That ' s why , when you step into one of our restaurants for a taste of the most delicious seafood around , you won ' t see a single female employee who isn ' t a server or hostess , and you ' ll never , ever see a woman working in any kind of supervisory role .
