However , when we look at the world , it is quite clear that many nations have not chosen to honor the will of God . Far too many nations do not value their own people ' s sovereign right to be free , their God given right to choose who will lead them . And , of course , that is where you , as young people , as well as those of you as parents , fit into such a terribly complex puzzle of a world that has seemingly gone so horribly wrong . If other nations of the world are going to choose to dictate to their own people , if they are going to continue to deprive their very own citizens of the right to choose who they want to govern , then we , as a country , have no choice but to do what God demands of us no choice but to tell them that they must change their ways or else they will be required to suffer the consequences . They must realize that an America led by God will do whatever it must in order to restore the Kingdom of God on the earth , a kingdom deeply imbued with a love for freedom and democracy .
