" My 6 year old son Brandon is a real handful , suffering from hyperactivity and a whole host of emotional problems . Sometimes the stress of taking care of him all by myself is just too much . But then , when I think of the little baby Jesus lying in the manger , I realize how special and wonderful Brandon really is . On Christmas Eve , when he gave me a drawing he made that said , ' I Love Mommy , ' I knew he is the one true light of my life . "
