" This is what women love to see , " McMahon said . " The damsel in distress story is as old as the hills . " When asked about the plot line where Stephanie played a domestic violence victim with the audience positioned to cheer on her scripted ( and real life ) husband , " Triple H , " McMahon brushed it aside as fantasy , play acting . As for the sequence where her husband Vince McMahon orders a woman wrestler to strip , get on her knees , and bark like a dog as the audience yells " slut , " McMahon said , " How different is this from Anastasia Steele ? It ' s not real abuse , it ' s acting out a fantasy , harmless role playing , totally consensual . " McMahon boasts that WWE has created " powerful heroic female characters " who stand up to " bad guys " who always " pay a price " for their attacks on women . " Our television audience would not be nearly 40 female if we were degrading women , " Brian Flinn , WWE Senior VP for Marketing and Communications claimed .
