" Our goal for the Barbie line is to show young girls that they can be successful . Barbie represents every young girl , and empowers them to become doctors , veterinarians , teachers or any other of number of respectable careers . A suicide bomber is by no means a career goal that the Mattel Corporation wants any young girl to espouse , " continued Cabrini . " Aside from the political pitfalls , we just don ' t want little girls aspiring to blow themselves up . That ' s just not a good career goal . "
