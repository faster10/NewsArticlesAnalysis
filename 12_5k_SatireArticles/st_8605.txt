The big money is on the Wombat , after his stunning five set semi final victory over Roger Federer , but , in the likely heat of Melbourne Park , his squat , muscular frame may become burdensome . Another potential achilles heel is his tendency , mid match , to revert to traditional wombat burrowing behaviour and start digging up the court he was warned twice for this against Federer . Don ' t rule out a surprise . The Eastern Grey has stamina to burn , as he showed in the 15 13 fourth set of his win over Britain ' s Andy Murray in the other semi final . Smart money may yet move over to the rangy kangaroo , for whom superior height and reach and a rock solid baseline game may also prove formidable weapons against the brutal power and aggression of the wombat ' s serve and volley arsenal .
