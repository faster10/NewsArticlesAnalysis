Wakipedia , the famous expose website ( yes , that is spelled correctly ) , has brought to light taped conversations between NRA Fuhrer LaPierre and none other than Russian Czar Vladimir Putin about expanding Soviet ( yes , we might as well start calling them Soviets again . They certainly act like the Cold War is back in full bloom again . ) sales of Kalashnikov rifles to anybody who wants them . Especially Middle easterners you know damn well they are going to use them . The Middle Easterners want an endless conveyor belt of guns and the Russians desperately need something to prop up their sanction laden and oil dependent currency .
