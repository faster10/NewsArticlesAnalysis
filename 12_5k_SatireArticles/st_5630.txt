" Donald ' s the one who really runs the Department of Defense , " Rice said . " He ' s always a few steps ahead of us . Like , when he heard that first lady Laura Bush was going shopping last Friday , he made sure a car was available to pick her up from the mall , because he knew the president would forget . And don ' t think the president was solely responsible for that lovely birthday lollipop bouquet Colorado senator Wayne Allard got this week , or for the reorganization of the worldwide command structure that resulted in the establishment of the U . S . Strategic Command . Nope , it was all Donald ' s doing . I swear he has five arms ! "
