Nolan Ryan , Bush ' s personal pitching coach for the event , said he is confident that the president won ' t get rattled , even in a pressure packed situation like Game 1 of the World Series . " Mr Bush may walk his share of batters , but as long as he keeps the ball down and prevents the big inning , he should be fine , " Ryan said . " After all , the president has worked himself into jams before . But everyone knows he ' s a man who always finds a way to get out unscathed . "
