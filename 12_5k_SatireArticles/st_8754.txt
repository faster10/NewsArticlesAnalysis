A spokesman for the government is quoted as saying : " This government has developed the fairest system of taxation this country has ever known . The so called bedroom tax makes perfect sense whatever way you look at it . It ensures that people on benefits don ' t have the burden of extra rooms they are not using . After all , they would only have to hoover these extra rooms several times a week , not to mention the dusting and cleaning required . We have removed all that unnecessary work from them and lessened their overall responsibilities . When viewed in this light , only a fool could argue with this tax .
