To date , no money has been raised in an effort to rescue Ennis from the well , nor has anyone in the community volunteered to chip in and provide the desperate man with food , fresh water , or words of encouragement . Though Ennis has only had a handful of visitors in the past week , sources did confirm that several members of the town ' s First Presbyterian Church stopped by on Thursday and together prayed for the 38 year old to " get his act together .
