The point directly concerning the World Cup is the issue of sitting for three hours or more . First , I ' ve watched all the games so far , and I haven ' t sat for three hours during any game . Not even when the game went into overtime and penalty shootouts . I got off my rear at least ten times during any game to walk to the kitchen for a drink or a snack , and to go to the bathroom . Halftime for the players is get up time for me .
