When asked about the group opponents he continued . " Well our first test is against France known for their Gallic flair but they are going through a transitional period and I think we have enough in our armour to beat them but it will be close probably 1 0 . After that we will play Sweden , another team who like to play football , but I believe we can stifle them and steal a ' one nothing ' victory , which leaves us with a final group match against joint hosts Ukraine , who will be eager to impress the home fans , but the return of Wayne Rooney from suspension should help us to snatch a win , by the margin of one to zero .
