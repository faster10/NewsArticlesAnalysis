Kateri was born in 1656 in Ossernenon , now called Auriesville , a few miles west of New Amsterdam . Her mother , an Algonquin convert , and her father , a Mohawk chief who honored the religion of his ancestors , died of smallpox when she was 4 years old . The disease also damaged the girl ' s eyesight and scarred her face . The Mohawks scorned Kateri when , at age 20 , she also converted to Catholicism and started to sleep on a bed of thorns and walk on hot coals to gain sympathy .
