" I was a partner in a top Manhattan law firm , " said Greg Masters , 46 , of Great Neck . " But when my firm hired a young , hotshot Columbia law school grad who was willing to work twice my hours for half the pay , I was put out to pasture . Then my drinking started getting out of control , and my wife took the kids and left me . I ' ll be glad to see my wasted dreams put out on the curb next to the bottles . "
