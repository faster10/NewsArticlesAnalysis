" Besides Dolly , there ' s Wynonna and Reba and , of course , Patsy , " Fontenot said . " That woman was the queen , absolutely the queen . But Dolly can belt them out just like Patsy could . And whom do we owe for writing Whitney Houston ' s ' I Will Always Love You ' ? That ' s right , Dolly Parton . I love Whitney ' s version , but nobody can do that one like Dolly . She owns that song . "
