" I really like what I ' m hearing out of Congressman Ryan , " said undecided voter Peter Garland of High Point , NC , adding that the vice presidential candidate ' s impassioned attack on Romney ' s previous policy positions would " definitely " help him make up his mind . " He really opened up my eyes about how Romney refused to sign an anti tax pledge in 2002 and how the average tax burden actually increased in Massachusetts during his tenure . I have to say , I appreciate how Ryan calls it as he sees it , and that will certainly play a big role in my decision come November . "
