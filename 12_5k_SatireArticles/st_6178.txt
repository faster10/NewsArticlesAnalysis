And what if a hyena comes to eat its remains ? Neighborhood children might try to pet it and risk contracting terrible brain and nerve diseases . And I ' d hate for this ox to interfere with this Saturday ' s pee wee soccer playoffs : My Kyle is playing goalie , and he ' d be just heartbroken if the game were cancelled because of a dead mammal .
