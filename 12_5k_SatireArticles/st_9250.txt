1 . The word " client " will not be used in the King Kong , CPA , firm . It simply makes no sense in the ' gotcha ' environment in which we operate . In common everyday English , the word " client " denotes one to be both served and protected in other words , a " client " is definitely not one on whom you " tattle " at the first opportunity . But tattling is what reigns these days . My firm has no choice but to go with the flow . Service , yes . Protection , no !
