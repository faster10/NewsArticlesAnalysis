But enough talk about the past . The WSJ recommends that relating some current highlights of your life with your husband will provide his coworkers with a glimpse of who your husband really is when he is not the stiff cardboard cut out character who works with them . This can reveal admirable qualities and traits that were previously unknown to the coworkers as well as the boss , such as how the coding genius husband has developed software to share his massive porn collection with everyone in the world for free . Or how the husband devotes most of his weekends to his 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) charity that provides free access to porn to people in the third world . After all , everyone admires people who contribute to charity . And people in the third world need porn as well as food , basic health services , jobs and clean water .
