" We ' re not making excuses or nothin , but the refs gotta call that . I mean , I ' m not the type of guy to embellish any kind of contact I was basically mauled shooting that free throw . But yeah , no excuses , " said Wade . " If the refs make the call like they should have , that would ' ve been five fouls on Kawhi Leonard and could ' ve changed the whole game . Mario Chalmers sucked too . But we don ' t make excuses . "
