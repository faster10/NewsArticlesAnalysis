" If they ' re going to claim they have proof the flag is still flying , they had better back it up with more than a few paltry bombs bursting in air , " American Atheist President David Silverman told reporters . " The bombs were circumstantial evidence at best that could not lead to any scientifically verifiable conclusion . The National Anthem is misleading our children and all Americans about the meaning of proof . " Silverman equates people believing bombs are proof for a flags existence to people who believe the universe existing is proof of God . " Those who believe God created the universe are the same delusional people who think bombs are proof that a Flag is waving , " Silverman added .
