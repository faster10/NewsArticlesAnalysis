We shall fight Goodell on the beaches , we shall fight on the landing grounds , we shall fight in the fields and in the streets , we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender , and if , which I do not for a moment believe , Brady ' s career or part of it were subjugated and starving , then our Patriots beyond the seas , armed and guarded by the New England fans , would carry on the struggle , until , in God ' s good time , the New World , with all its power and might , steps forth to the rescue Tom ' s honor from the evil clutches of Ted Bottomless Wells and Roger Badell .
