" I will then force the still exquisite Katherine to witness the removal of William ' s scalp from the back of his head , to well past his eyelids . He will then be unable to look away as my guards take turns defiling the young mother until she screams for mercy . I will then present her with her child and tell her she is free to go . And as she hobbles toward me with her precious child in my arms , pitifully sniveling like a beaten cur , I will make her thank me for my mercy , and by own my hand , force her infant child back into where it came from .
