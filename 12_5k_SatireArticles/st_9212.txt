They both would laugh to themselves when thoughts of divorce occurred and each would hire an expensive lawyer only to find out that Larry had lost all of their life savings when he invested it all in a company that made solar powered garbage disposals , six months prior . In the end they would have to sell their house so that each of them could pay their attorneys who would gleefully walk away with every last penny that they had , although the attorneys would give each of them a coupon for a free McDonald ' s large fries . I guess in their case fries will come with their divorce .
