Remember the good old days . McCarthy ? . . How we miss him ! Joe had more style than Edgar Hoover , although worse taste in lingerie . Not as much style as Charlton Heston though . . . Moses in reality never looked like that . Moses was a short , brown guy with bad teeth . But who ' s to know ? ( Laughter ) . But what a relief it is to have our ' enemy ' back again even if their uniforms are nothing to write home about . Back to style aren ' t we ? I still have Himmler ' s leather Gestapo coat in my wardrobe . The Germans had style and I am sure Pope Francis will agree with me . . . style convinces . Can you imagine Francis in jeans , baseball cap and sneakers giving forth from his balcony ? ( Laughter ) . Who would believe a single word he said ? Would somebody give Queen Elizabeth a glass of water ?
