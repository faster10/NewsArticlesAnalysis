NEW ORLEANS Front office executives of the New Orleans Saints football team provided a much needed dose of normalcy Monday when they announced that , for the 23rd year running , the Saints season had been ruined before it began . " I ' d say this is even worse than when Mike Ditka traded away all our draft picks to get Ricky Williams , " said Saints vice president of pro personnel operations Bill Kuharich . " But there ' s one thing we Saints can always rely on : our chances for a winning season being shitcanned before we play a single down . We ' re proud to have carried on with this tradition despite everything . " The National Football League has declined the Saints ' " mercy rule " request to be allowed to forfeit all their home games , saying the team must set an example for its home city by being blown out in every contest .
