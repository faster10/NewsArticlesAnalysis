" I got maybe three hours of sleep the entire expo , " said Dr Cyrus Patel , who had to cancel nearly 40 appointments this week because he was too exhausted to go into work . " I kept telling myself I was allowed only one more optic disc drusen seminar and then I had to go to bed , but that would mean missing Dr Lappen ' s keynote on optical coherence tomography , and it ' s like , you only live once , you know ? It ' s not like there ' s another Optic Disc Expo next month . This is it for 2011 . "
