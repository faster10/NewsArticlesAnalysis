" Look at this section here : ' Slide Out Rack And Bake Pan . ' This whole section is Charlie . None of this is mine , " said Leff , pointing to a page in the " grossly compromised " work . " The heading , as I wrote it , was ' Using And Enjoying The Slide Out Rack And Bake Pan . ' I can ' t tell you how many drafts I went through to get the rhythm and scansion of that header just right . Then , out of nowhere , Charlie just waves his wizard wand and changes it to this clunky , graceless , ' Slide Out Rack And Bake Pan ' crap . "
