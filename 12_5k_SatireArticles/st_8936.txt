Cleaning lady Phyllis Leather of the Milkmaid ' s Arms hadn ' t come across Ms . Lovehandles ' alien theory , but it makes little impression on her when explained . " Aliens or not , " she says , " they make a lot less mess than the smokers especially the buggers that roll their own . " Landlord and boss , Steve Ragg , was even less impressed , choosing instead to argue with Lovehandles ' definition of ' regular pub goer ' . " She might be an expert on aliens , but if she thinks ' regular ' means one pint of John Smith ' s a week then the woman ' s barking . They can be as alien as they like as far as I ' m concerned but if they don ' t start drinking a whole lot more , my pub won ' t be here for them come Christmas . And that ' ll be your job gone , Phyllis . "
