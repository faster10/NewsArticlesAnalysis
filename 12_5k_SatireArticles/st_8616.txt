" He was all over me like a gay plague , " the Wigan keeper complained . " I wouldn ' t have minded so much if I was gay , but I ' m not ! While I was attempting to prevent the ball from crossing our goal line , Fernando was caressing my face and wiggling his bottom against my tummy . I was shocked ! I thought he was in love with me or something . As it turned out , he doesn ' t really want to get jiggy with me he was just trying to prevent me from playing the ball . Which to be honest is a huge relief . I mean , nobody in their right mind would want a 50 million Spanish striker cuddling up to their cojones . It ' s just wrong is that . "
