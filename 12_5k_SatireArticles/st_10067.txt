" Then , we called his passing a mysterious tragedy , " Aridge said . " We conveyed to the public our sense of nihilistic ennui that things happened for no reason , that ours was a Godless existence , bereft of reason , following no rules , leaving us no anchors of reality upon which we might moor our very lives . We said " one day he was there , calling a Hockey game , and the next , he was a goner . As dead as the dirt on the bottom of our shoes . Well , we were wrong . His death was well deserved and makes perfect sense . We are here to tell you that he drowned in semen , and thanks to that knowledge , we can also proclaim that God and Reason are not dead after all . "
