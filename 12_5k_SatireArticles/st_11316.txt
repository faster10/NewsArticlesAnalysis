Questions from reporters regarding Dumball Arsefelt ' s speech about liberating the French oilfields " at all costs " were dismissed as Democratic party election propaganda by Dr Condette Cherie Morte , who explained that Dumball ' s straitjacket had been recovered , that he was now very comfortable and under sedation again . She denied the French offer to " reduce the original 13 colonies to radioactive dust " had anything at all to do with the US government ' s retraction of Mr Arsefelt ' s invasion threats .
