Battling the waves of condescension , Focus on the Family , a leading faith based organization based in Boulder , Colorado , has condemned parents who craft elaborate lies to deceive their children . According to a letter posted on their web site , " The bible clearly tells us that lying is a sin , even if our intentions are good . Although we can relate to the struggle parents are facing , we cannot encourage our members to blatantly mislead their children . Instead of blaming other people , we feel the best thing to do is to tell children the truth : Santa Clause is a dirty Jew . "
