" The jungle battles with the Vietcong were the best part , " said Walter Kinchen , 45 , who served three tours from 1969 to 1971 . " A lot of times , you ' d look the enemy in the eye , and instead of killing each other , you ' d exchange phone numbers and become friends . They ' d show us their hidden forts , and we ' d invite them back to our bases to check out imported American amenities like name brand cigarettes and booze . "
