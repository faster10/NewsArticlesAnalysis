The study looked at both moderate bullfighting , defined as no more than 14 bullfights per week , and heavy bullfighting , defined as fighting five or more bulls on a single occasion at least five times per month . Researchers said that while the first category includes individuals who might bullfight socially or after a stressful day at work , the second consists of those who might keep a matador ' s suit hidden in their home or slip out of the house to fight a bull behind the garage after their family has gone to bed for the night .
