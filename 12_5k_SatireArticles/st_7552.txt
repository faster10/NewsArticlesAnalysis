" I ' ll be quite frank with you Thomas , " said Dr Phil , while taping an interview with now world famous Thomas Beatie . " May I call you Thomas ? Good . Listen , Thomas , I won ' t beat around the bush here . I ' m going to ask you directly what ' s on the mind of every red blooded American male and wants to know right now . Why ? Why in did you do it ? Are you stupid or dumb or something ? Tell me what it is . Because , to tell you the truth , if you would have come to me first , I would have given you drugs and lots of them , at least until you came to your senses and changed your mind or went into menopause . Or maybe had an anvil fall out of the blue sky and hit you on the head or maybe you ran off a cliff while chasing a roadrunner . I don ' t know . Something , anything but this ! "
