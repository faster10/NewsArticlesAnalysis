Albert Truckle , 67 from Ryde is a recent convert to IWIP . ' I think a lot of what they say makes sense . ' he said . ' I want to return to the old days when we islander ' s were in control and made the rules . If we want to burn the odd witch or two on All Hallows , why shouldn ' t we ? Why should those MP ' s at Westminster make the rules when they ' ve never set foot on the island ? '
