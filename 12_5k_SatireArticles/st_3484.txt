Though multiple shouts of " Same team ! " were heard echoing throughout the more than 1 million square miles of the Great Plains , not one member of the 2 20 Oklahoma City Thunder realized that no other basketball organization was around to wrest the ball away from them .

O ' Neal , not knowing what was going on , threw the ball into the Grand Canyon , which is where the ball currently sits .
