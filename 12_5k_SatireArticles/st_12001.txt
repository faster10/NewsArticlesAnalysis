According to eyewitnesses , Smelt , who was a small and frail person , and the robust and busty Boxtop , were mingled amongst 400 shoppers . All were patiently waiting for the Wal Mart doors to open for the annual Big Meat Sale . Amid the mad opening rush into the store , Smelt ' s face was forced into the cleavage of Boxtop ' s ample 54EE busom by the pushing and shoving crowd . As the crowd moved into the store , Smelt was carried along , his face pushing deeper into Boxtop ' s cleavage . The official coroner ' s report claims that within minutes , Smelt simply suffocated and died . His body was discovered by store floor cleaners amid a pile of hamburger wrappers .
