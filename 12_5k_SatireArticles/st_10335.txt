The AP reported early Thursday that there were indications that McCain ' s own running mate , Sarah Palin , might be considering defection , though she was on a Moose hunt late Thursday , and could not be reached for comment . Other thoughts on likely candidates include radio commentators Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage , Fox News commentator Sean Hannity , and the late President Ronald Reagan .
