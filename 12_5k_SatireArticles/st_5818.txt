I ' m always going over to one of their places to watch TV , order some food , get so sexually distracted that I can barely focus on anything but my own carnal starvation , and then as soon as I get home descend into debilitating worries that I ' ll always be this terribly , unfathomably alone . We have a lot of fun . "
