" We push forth united , " said Bush in a public television broadcast in both the United States and Canada . " Our forces have taken strategic Canadian military bases and we are prepared to go all the way . Alberta is a big province , and it will be a long haul to the top , but we will get there . In doing so , we release a battered , broken , socialist nation from its self absorbed , self built prison and allow it to integrate with us . We will free them . This is Operation Canadian Freedom . United with the former Canada , which I will rename the North States , ' we will be stronger . "
