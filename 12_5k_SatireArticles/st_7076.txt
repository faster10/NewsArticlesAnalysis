Santa ' s elves are furious . They know that once the Wall Streeters take control , change will be in the works . The elves are bristling at the rumor that little people will no longer be high priority as far as employment goes . Following the rules of Affirmative Action , people of all sizes and shapes will now be equally considered for jobs . Phooey , say the elves , pointing out that big folks will take up too much room in Santa ' s workshop and will inadvertently break some favorite creations . One elf complained , " The next thing you know , Bigfoot will be lumbering in and wanting a job here . Ridiculous . "
