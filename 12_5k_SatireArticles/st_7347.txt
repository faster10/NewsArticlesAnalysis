Jonah : The biblical story is about a man trying to escape God rather than fulfill God ' s command to speak to the city of Nineveh to get the city to repent of their sins . Jonah ends up in the belly of a " great fish " ( the bible doesn ' t actually say whale ) . Eventually Jonah repents of his own sins , is saved from the big fish , and speaks to the citizens of Nineveh , all of whom indeed repent . The producers of the proposed movie version hope to reunite two stars of the cast from Jaws namely Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss . This despite Scheider ' s death in 2008 . The Jonah character in the movie will end up in the belly of " a great fish " after being eaten by a Great White shark .
