But some of the funny car drivers don ' t think the newly proposed track features are all that funny . After the interview , Rusty Muffler caught up with one of the top drag strip warriors on the current NHRA circuit , Bobby " Blazin ' " Pistons , who also acts as the head of the Driver ' s Union . He had this to say : " A lot of the boys out there are complainin ' about that dang second loopity loop ! " told Pistons . " The first one is OK , they can deal with that . but that second one comin ' at you at 230 miles per hour is a lot of G forces on the body , which makes it hard to control a 4000 lb dragster . "
