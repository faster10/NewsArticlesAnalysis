Somewhere along the line , my classmates would count their cards and realize that they didn ' t get one from everybody in the class . When they compared notes , they would discover that I hadn ' t given any to the boys ( and some boy would feel this great need to tattle on me to the teacher ) . I would be asked to please hand out my Valentine ' s to the boys and would tell the teacher that I didn ' t have any and wouldn ' t give them to the boys ( even at that age , I avoided appearing anything like a Fudgie ) .
