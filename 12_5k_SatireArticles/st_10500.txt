Michael Mertz , president of the Southeast Michigan Foghat Alliance , welcomed the spotlight saying that this type of attention can only help rekindle interest in the band that once rocked the FM airwaves . Mertz particularly enjoyed the fact that John Kerry barreled into the Warren Town Meeting blasting the 1975 hit Slowride . " I used to get my game on when that song started playing , " stated Mertz as he methodically swayed to the heavy baseline in his head . " We ' d just get high and screw back then . " He added , " I bet that ' s how Johnny and Teresa roll too . "
