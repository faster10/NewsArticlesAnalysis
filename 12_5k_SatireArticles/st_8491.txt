The whole incident reminded me of my recent trip to Funchalt , the fishing village where Ronaldo was born . I bumped into a couple of fishermen in a bar who told me that they used to teach Ronaldo how to deep sea dive when he was a child . When I mentioned the situation with Real Madrid one said " Stick with Sir Fergie , he a good hair dryer , maybe when he retire he make my hair good ! " They burst into laughter and ruffled their hair . But you know what , maybe if Sir Alex does get bored when he eventually retires , he can come out to Funchalt and enjoy the kind of good times that I have shared with these two stupid fishermen sitting on the shore talking fish .
