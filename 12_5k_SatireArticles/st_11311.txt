When the newly inducted Bush family decided to go after Iraq they delayed the Arab Union which was scheduled to follow . Now Arab nations will want nothing to do with the American plans for a New World Order because the Bushes created a rift between America and Muslims . The attacks of 9 11 were designed to create a feeling world wide of sorrow for America , causing the sympathies of all nation to want to help America . Bush saw Iraq as a threat to the plans and felt they were so small an invasion would be over looked as it would only last a few weeks . Now the problems Bush created are going to require at least a decade to reverse if not more .
