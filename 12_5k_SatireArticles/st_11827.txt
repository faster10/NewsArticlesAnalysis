" These Millennial job searchers somehow have a bad attitude when it comes to serfdom , but it ' s all about perspective , " Poloz explained . " They just need to look at the positives . For example , you cannot be sold as property by the Lord of the Manor so you are technically not a slave your future children will by right of birth also become serfs thus getting a huge leg up in the servitude market and the odds of you being murdered by an errant knight are relatively slim . How great does that sound ?
