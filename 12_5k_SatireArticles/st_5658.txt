According to sources close to Hussein , the final straw came on July 30 , when al Khurmah struck an immunity deal with the 22 year old concubine in exchange for her testimony against the Iraqi ruler . The concubine who remains unnamed because of fundamentalist doctrine stipulating that convicted harlots be referred to as " She Who Cannot Be Named " agreed to provide al Khurmah with a full account of Hussein ' s alleged sexual misconduct . She also agreed to hand over to prosecutors the infamous " Love Veil , " a black , woolen facial covering Hussein allegedly removed to gaze upon her exposed hair , facial features and upper neck . Under the terms of the concubine ' s deal with the Special Inquisitor ' s office , in exchange for her testimony , she will be spared execution for harlotry by public stoning .
