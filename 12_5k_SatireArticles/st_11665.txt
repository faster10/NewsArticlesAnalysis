Now , let ' s all agree : this is a free country , no ? Good . So why do you think it is that certain people might not want me to propagate statistics like the ones above ? Or suggest that women should just maybe consider the guy ' s feelings first before they quietly warn each other about " creepy dudes ? Or point out that since only about 1 of sexual assaults lead to convictions , this logically means 99 of sexual assaults didn ' t really happen ? Why would it be that someone would want to stop me from doing this ? ( Also , please don ' t actually answer any of these questions )
