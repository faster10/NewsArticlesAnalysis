Canadians asked Google 589 times in 2015 who the leader of the NDP is and why he was on their lawn . Some searchers must have also wanted to find out how to remove him from their lawn : How do I remove a Tom Mulcair from my lawn ? ' was another popular search ( but didn ' t make the list ) . Despite this search being asked so many times , Google doesn ' t provide many answers . The top links provided by Google are either about Mulcair or about lawn care , but not both . Maybe try Bing ?
