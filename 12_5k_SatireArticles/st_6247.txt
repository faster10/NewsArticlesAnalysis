Matthews , who assured sectionmates that he was not shitting them , said Phelan was dressed in his typical style , wearing a button down shirt and khakis . The T . A . was accompanied by two females , one of them " pretty okay looking , " and one who " looked kinda cute , but sorta old . " Matthews said it was not clear if either of the two women were Phelan ' s girlfriend , though at one point , the older looking one stroked the T . A . ' s forearm with her left hand .
