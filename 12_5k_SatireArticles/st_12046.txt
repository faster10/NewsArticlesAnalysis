Editors Note : This is a true story . The government is selling one dollar coins at face value shipped free ' to your home or business . People caught on to a scheme to profit themselves in various legal ways . The Government was giving them the opportunity to be in a business . People bought hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of coins and collected air miles and vacation mile points on their credit cards . The credit card companies made 1 . 5 to 2 percent transaction fees against the government , shipping companies made profits from shipping hefty items around the country , and the banks ended up storing vast amounts of coins that everyone hates , but could do nothing about since its legal tender . After sometime the government bean counters finally spoke . . " Hey ! We ' re being screwed ! " So , in order to prevent people from ordering tens of thousands of dollars worth of coins everyday , which cost the government millions in ' free shipping ' costs and credit card chargebacks , they simply put a limit of 1 , 000 coins every ten days per customer .
