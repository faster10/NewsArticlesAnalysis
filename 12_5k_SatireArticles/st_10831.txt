The sun was shining bright on the morning of our execution . We could hear the banging of the hammer as the last nail was driven into the scaffold . I looked out and watched the sand bags dropped as they tested the trap doors on which we would stand . We were taken out together . The sun hurt our eyes after the darkness of the jail cells . Our feet shuffled , no longer do we need hurry . The crowd watched in fascination as we were placed on the fatal trap doors . I looked out on the spectators wondering how can so many be deceived into believing Lyin George when he justified the attacks on little sovereign nations like Afghanistan and Iraq and when he tells them globalization is good for them while they visit the food banks for their next meal . Our hang person Jolly Jean asked if we had any last requests . Ticklish and I said we would like to go fishing . With that the black hoods were placed on our heads and I wondered if it was Ticklish Terry ' s standard consciousness that got me into this mess . As the wicked trap doors sprung open and I plunged down I woke up . It took a few minutes for the dream to drift from my consciousness . Then I offered a prayer of thankgiving that it was only a dream . However , it raised a big question in my mind , should I continue to speak the truth about the corruption in the American government or continue and perhaps receive a simular fate as was my dream .
