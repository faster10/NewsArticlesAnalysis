A German efficiency expert working with Ford is trying to reduce several inefficiencies and cost factors in the H 20 ' s operation . According to Dr Hans Krabbe of Sehr Sehr Deutsch Consulting , the average fueling time for the typical eleven gallon gasoline or diesel car fuel tank is 4 . 2 minutes . For the H 20 , it takes 28 . 6 minutes , and produces 48 empty plastic bottles and 48 plastic caps , which Krabbe estimates contain the petroleum energy of 9 . 8 gallons of oil . At current prices , which are expected to rise as demand increases as more H 20 ' s get on the road , filling up an H 20 costs about 52 , or about 4 . 40 a gallon .
