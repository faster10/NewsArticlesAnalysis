Hans , we do not know his last name , was rushed to the hospital by an ambulance . He said that he was driving his new Ford when he saw a spark in the steering wheel , causing an electrical current and paralyzing his body . He is now being taken care of physically , but has not gained consciousness yet . Who knows what terrible things the current could have done to him . A paramedic told us that his brain function was abnormal , and that his blood flow was flowing in reversed order .
