" Rick always used to talk about ' the lazy drug dealers , ' " Heidi said . " Not anymore . He ' s always talking about how amazed he is that guys like local cocaine kingpin Dean ' Powder ' Edwards have been doing this for 20 years . I really don ' t think Rick can last another six months , so hopefully he ' ll have a solid case built by then . I sure hope so . I don ' t think I can stand much more of his bitching about how he spent all day hauling around kilos of uncut Colombian . "
