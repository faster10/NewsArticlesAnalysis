" My vagina is off limits . I won ' t do a nude scene in a movie unless it is absolutely necessary to the plot . For instance , if I was playing a steelworker I would have no qualms going topless c ' mon , wearing a shirt in them temperatures would be stoopid . Or if I were playing the part of an exotic nymphomaniac lapdancing teacher on an island of Amazonian women I could hardly disagree with the artistic need for subtle nudity or the possible use of my vagina , could I ? .
