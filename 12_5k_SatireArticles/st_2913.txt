The findings were later confirmed by a series of experiments in which two people one either a grandparent or a child with Down Syndrome , and the other a person who is neither were locked in a room together . Researchers behind a one way mirror then observed the results . " We ran the experiment 855 times , " said Dr Henry Fitzrollins , developer of the test , " and every time , within 30 to 40 seconds , the grandparent or disabled child would approach the other person , usually to say , ' I like you , ' or to offer to buy them ice cream . And , in every case , the other person would respond by retreating to the farthest possible corner of the room . The friendliness unfriendliness disparity between the two groups was stunning . "
