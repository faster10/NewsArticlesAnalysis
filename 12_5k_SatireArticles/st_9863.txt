The apparition responded , " Apologetix is my absolute favorite modern rock group , because like me , they find inspiration in many musicians whose views may be very different from their own , while using those musicians ' sound to spread their own Christian faith with the world . My favorite of their songs are ' Jail Got Rocked , ' ' Cut Rate Hotel , ' ' Don ' t Be Fooled , ' ' Found God , ' ' Little Esther , ' and my absolute favorite , ' Wise Men Still . ' "
