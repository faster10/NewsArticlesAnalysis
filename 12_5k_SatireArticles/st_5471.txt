" The American tradition of democracy is great , but it could be dramatically streamlined , " said former Intel executive Jerome Klieg , now the CEO of VelociVote , a company that plans to bid for the 2008 presidential election . " Guaranteed No Wait Voting ' is a good idea , but it basically approaches the election of our leader the same way we ' ve approached it for centuries . Now , hear me out . Currently , every American citizen over 18 years of age is eligible to vote . That ' s 195 million voters . Whoa ! Seriously . That ' s a lot of voters . Having every American vote creates mass confusion , as we saw in 2000 and 2004 . Why ? To what end ? "
