" Deep down , Superman is a farm boy . I mean , do you think he could keep up that hokey Clark Kent act if there wasn ' t some truth in it ? But it ' s not like he ' s this gap toothed yokel with his overall straps falling down . He ' s worked hard to break out of that hicktown stigma and his family gave up a lot to get him the breaks he needed . So Superman is really uptight about people who can ' t comport themselves properly in public , because he knows how important your image is to your credibility . "
