The Daily Mail has come in for stern criticism with its mix of made up stories and daily articles about someone called Kim Kadashian , who noone ' s ever heard of . The paper , which is crammed full of adverts yet still charges extortionate prices , is printed daily and can be read from cover to cover in less than ten minutes . The BBC , however , has a world wide reputation for exemplary journalism , quality programming and choice over many terrestrial , digital and radio channels .
