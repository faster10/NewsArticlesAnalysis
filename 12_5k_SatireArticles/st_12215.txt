Rocky said all owners are offered a battery policy for 12 , 000 up front which guarantees free battery replacement after 7 years , or if the owner gets electrocuted during the charging operation , which ever comes first . However , he was quick to point out , owner neglect does not allow the policy holder to collect a new battery . " They ' ll just have to wait 7 years to be eligible to collect in the meantime I suggest they ride a F g bus , " said Rocky .
