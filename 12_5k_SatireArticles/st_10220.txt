" Eventually we will be able to sign people up to work for 25 below minimum wage ( which we hope the Bush administration will reduce even further in the coming months ) , pay for zero benefits , and require them to work 84 hours per week without overtime pay , while gaining significant tax breaks for hiring the disadvantaged . Within 10 years , we hope to be able to sell pretty much everything currently in our stores for about half of what you ' d have to pay today . Furthermore , we expect the wage slashing smiley face on their reduced paychecks , to bring a smile to the affected employees , making them forget all about how badly they ' re being screwed . This initiative has a twofold benefit in that it makes it next to impossible for our employees to be able to afford to shop anywhere but Wal Mart , so effectively we expect to recoup about 75 of all the wages we pay out via in store sales .
