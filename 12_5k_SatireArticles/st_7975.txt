" We want Massachusetts to lose its mass , " said Jass , citing an example of GAS . " We want Mississippi to say goodbye to Mrs Butterworth . We want Atlanta to stop reaching for Mylanta . We want to make Portland less portly . We want Milwaukee to actually be able to walk . We want the Garden State to start eating garden salads . We want the Sooner State to end its meals sooner . We want the Panhandle State to lose its love handle state . . . I can keep going if you want . "
