Ok . Plan B . You go out and buy me a bag of Cheetos , and I ' ll pay you back . Don ' t worry about money . I got plenty of quarters in my collection . You wouldn ' t believe the amount of coins people throw down onto the tracks . What ' s a bag of Cheetos ? Four quarters ? I got four quarters for you . Just come and get them . You want gum as well ? I got plenty of that , too . Just get me those damn Cheetos man .
