" I was so scared , " explained Sasha the boxer . " At first I was like where are you going ? ' and then I fell asleep , and then I woke up and I was like I would like some water ' and then while having some water I was pretty sure I saw a squirrel so I barked for a good 15 , and then I fell asleep and then I woke up and I was scared again , but I couldn ' t remember why .
