Over the past few months Fisher has developed multiple theories about Alford ' s work schedule . Initially , the 26 year old was convinced that Alford had switched his hours and was working from 12 p . m . to 8 p . m . , while the next week it appeared as though Alford had begun working only three days a week . During the month of October , Alford reportedly left the apartment several times at 10 p . m . for a " work thing , " causing Fisher to briefly consider that his company had implemented some sort of night shift .
