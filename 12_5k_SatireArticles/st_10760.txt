Mr Van Dyke says he first learned of Guerneville after meeting visitors from this area at Amsterdam ' s Bulldog Tavern , No . 3 . They sent him some pictures of the Stumptown Parade and people enjoying a latte at one of Guerneville ' s rustic but cheery bistros , and the " romance " between the towns apparently bloomed from there . " We ' re hoping it gets cold enough for us to teach you the sport of Curling and perhaps have a little skating party on your river , too , " added the jubilant Van Dyke . Be patient , Stuyvesant we hear another Ice Age is on the way !
