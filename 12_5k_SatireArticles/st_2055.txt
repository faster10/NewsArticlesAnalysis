Other factors delayed Broberg ' s plan , including a long wait for an " especially chatty and slow moving " train attendant to come by and take his ticket , a 6 year old boy who kept running into the bathroom every five minutes for no apparent reason other than to remove handfuls of paper towels , and a passenger who boarded at the first stop and sat next to Broberg , forcing him into the window seat . According to Broberg , the man " immediately unwrapped a big , cumbersome hero sub " on his lap and began eating it while reading a broadsheet newspaper .
