" It was for the customer ' s own good . If these people had been buying yoghurt and low fat cottage cheese , we would have sent them discount vouchers for food rather than medical tests . But it would be irresponsible to enable those at risk of Type 2 Diabetes to continue eating when they should be fasting . Every last piece of fattening substance consumed by these very selfish people represents a potential drain on the National Health Service and supermarkets such as ours want to help weed out the worst culprits . If nothing is done , then the nation ' s entire health care system will collapse and everyone vehemently denies wanting that . In fact , our company can confirm that it is considering simplifying matters by the imposition of blanket bans against habitual buyers of chocolate or any other offending item , particularly when it is clear that those seeking to make the purchases have a low income and are failing to take sufficient exercise . We have withdrawn our wheelchair trolleys in some stores , because they were being abused by suspected Diabetes 2 types who can ' t be arsed to walk around the aisles unaided and kick of every time staff ask to see written evidence of good health and sound blood sugar levels " .
