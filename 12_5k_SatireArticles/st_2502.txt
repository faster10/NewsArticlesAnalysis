" Barbaro floated in through my window and told me that I was a good girl and that I could be anything I wanted to be when I grow up , " said Kimberly Drexel , 12 . " Then I asked him if he was real , but he just tucked me in with his hoof , told me to go back to sleep , winked at me , and disappeared . But this morning when I woke up , the window was open and there were horse hairs all over my bed . It was really him ! "
