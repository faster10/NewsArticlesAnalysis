" My client has always acted in the best interests of his patients . He feels that he should be left alone to prescribe valium to his heart ' s content , and that nobody has the right to criticise or question his professional judgement . He feels that the people of Doncaster are a bunch of miserable bastards who need to chill out , adding that they should be grateful that anybody can be bothered to prescribe them anything at all . It is his opinion that valium is good for the masses , and that they ought to be eternally grateful to him for throwing in his comedy impressions free of charge . My client is a progressive GP who is operating at the top of his game . "
