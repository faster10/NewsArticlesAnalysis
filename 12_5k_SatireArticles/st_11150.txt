All cases brought to the courts under Sharia Law will be decided by appointed imams who will be the sole authorities and decision makers under the new laws . There will be no appeals since there will be no higher courts : The imams ' decisions will be final and irrevocable . The old law courts and judicial system will be replaced by Islamic courts whose rulings will be based solely on The Holy Qur ' an which will replace the old Common Law and legislation as the source of all legal decisions .
