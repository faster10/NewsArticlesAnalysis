Leo recalls when he was a boy , showing great promise , and his Uncle Howie used to embarrass himself at the family get togethers . " I didn ' t realize it at the time , of course , but he was my crazy uncle . There ' s one in most families , especially if we ' re talking about a family that includes three or more brothers . Uncle Howie used to do the craziest things . His brothers and everyone else would be talking about their children or their latest vacations or their favourite soap operas or talk shows , and they ' d be playing with their techno toys while Howie would be sulking in the corner in a cloud of his body odour , dressed in the same threadbare and ill fitting shirt and pants he ' d always be wearing . And when crazy Uncle Howie would open his mouth , out would pour the most frivolous speculations .
