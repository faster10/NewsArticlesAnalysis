Kendall ' s speech continued after a standing ovation for no apparent reason , " Once Corbyn is elected they ' ll fall apart squabbling like morons . That ' s when I ' ll defect to the Conservative party and we can then begin properly dismantling everything this country holds dear . We can make Thatcher look like a lilly livered trade union loving Michael Foot impersonator . Yes , let ' s burn down the NHS ! Yes , let ' s trample all over the welfare state . Screw the poor ! In fact , let ' s feed them to our rich friends ! "
