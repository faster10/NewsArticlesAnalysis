This is also not the first time that Michael Moore has injured others from assault with his bouncing blubber and flying flab . People in the first through third rows of a speech were injured in 2004 when he defended his claims ( with wild , animated movements ) from his movie Farenheit 9 11 . He also slipped getting off of an escalator in 2007 and injured ten people in Los Angeles ( and successfully sued the escalator manufacturer for not posting enough warning signs that he had to move forward under his own motive power when he reached the top ) . In addition , a crowd at a private party at Richard Gere ' s home were treated for effects of a tidal wave in 2011 when he did a cannon ball off of the low dive into the swimming pool .
