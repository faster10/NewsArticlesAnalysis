This past Monday , the university released an announcement from the dean of students ' office : " Fellow Flyers , the word ' ghetto ' has been tied to our community for longer than any one of us has been settled on this campus . After several attempts to terminate its utterance , we have recognized our errors and wish to go above and beyond in recognizing your fundamental right to freedom of speech . Effective immediately , the official name for our collective neighborhoods is ' The Ghetto . ' With this official name change , we will be speaking not only to our history but to the city of Dayton ' s history . You ' ll be seeing many corresponding changes to our campus layout in the coming weeks . It ' s a great day to be a Flyer ! "
