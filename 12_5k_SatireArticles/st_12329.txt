What can we learn from experiences with this issue elsewhere ? We cite the experience in Great Britain . Despite the absence of a " gun culture , Great Britain , with one fifth the population of the U . S . , has experienced mass shootings that are eerily similar to those we have experienced in recent years . In 1987 a lone gunman killed 18 people in Hungerford . What followed was the Firearms Act of 1988 making registration mandatory and banning semi automatic guns and pump action shotguns . Despite this ban , on March 13 , 1996 a disturbed 43 year old former scout leader , Thomas Hamilton , murdered 16 school children aged five and six and a teacher at a primary school in Dunblane , Scotland . Within a year and a half the Firearms Act was amended to ban all private ownership of hand guns . After both shootings there were amnesty periods resulting in the surrender of thousands of firearms and ammunition . Despite having the toughest gun control laws in the world , gun related crimes increased in 2003 by 35 over the previous year with firearms used in 9 , 974 recorded crimes in the preceding 12 months . Gun related homicides were up 32 over the same period . Overall , gun related crime had increased 65 since the Dunblane massacre and implementation of the toughest gun control laws in the developed world .
