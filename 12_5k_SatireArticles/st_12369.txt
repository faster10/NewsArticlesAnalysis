The soon to be ex Governor admitted that " I never really fit in as a kid hell , I never even fit into my pants ! The other kids never picked me for their baseball teams , unless they needed a backstop . I did get to play some hockey , but that was because as a goalie , I was bigger than the net . If I didn ' t move , they couldn ' t get a puck in past me . Anyway I never really was much of a joiner , and so I am happy to be able to join in this Administration and be a team player . "
