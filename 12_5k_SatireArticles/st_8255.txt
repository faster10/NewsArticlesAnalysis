Talented youngster Clive ' Body Pop ' Dee will represent GB in the newly introduced Paralytic sport Xtreme Folding , which involves a fiendish course of obstacles to negotiate , including a wall of Alcopops and a minefield of J gerbombs . Despite injury concerns after a DIY accident left him short of a vital digit , Clive is confident he can tackle the likes of Two Dogs , Wee Beasties and Cheeky Vimtos and still cross the finishing line upright , before folding like a girl and vomiting all the colours of the rainbow . " The shots will have to be multiples of three fingers , but it ' s do able , " dribbles the genial East End tyre fitter , sliding off his bar stool . .
