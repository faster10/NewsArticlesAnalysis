" Tony Gardello was a good egg , " Thornton said , " Nice little wife and a home , a couple of kids . " Although the death was ruled an accident , something not uncommon in the dangerous sport of boxing , Thornton firmly maintained that he was to blame for Gardello ' s death . " I didn ' t go in there to outbox him . I went there to beat his brains out , to drive him into the canvas , to murder him . That ' s what I did " .
