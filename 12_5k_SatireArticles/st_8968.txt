Other stupid people who were affected by the flooding include a woman in Ely who only realised that her house wasn ' t insured when she attempted to make a claim last year after damage to a dozen of its bricks . A gentleman in Pembroke died in 1998 because he ' d built his house in a kind of quicksand that only goes " quick " when it gets wet . And there is the infamous story about a woman who was allergic to water , and so sandbagged her property to the max . This led to a painful addiction to sandbagging , which almost killed her when she sandbagged herself inside a telephone box .
