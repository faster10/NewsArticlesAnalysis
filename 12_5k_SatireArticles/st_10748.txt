Janet Napolitano , Secretary DHS : Seeing cars , buildings , streets , shrubbery , and vending machines splattered with blood , as scavenging birds pick at fresh corpses , can raise doubts regarding the security of our southern border . However , I assure everyone that the US Mexico Border has never , ever , ever been safer . In fact , the Department of Justice and Federal law enforcement are aggressively pursuing every violation of law on our borders , and will not stop until they have the answers we want .
