History is meaningless in the North . How do you write a history of stone ? How do you write a history of ice ? How do you write a history of wind that cuts through fur and cloth and flesh : that paralyzes the very soul ? How do you write a history of blood torn from the throat by white teeth blood that freezes on contact with the air and lands among the powder like cold garnets ? The North has no history . The North has no future . The North has only the North .
