But Ms . Lotsofgall isn ' t impressed . " Just look at these freaks ! " she says , shrugging off a hippie who had offered her a joint . " They ' re flaky do nothings . Don ' t they know they should be working non stop with hardly any vacation time , like in the US ? That ' s the meaning of life . You ' re supposed to work hard all day long for a very low wage that rarely increases , so your bosses can enrich themselves at your expense . That ' s how the real world works , the world of bogus economic models and Nazi inspired social Darwinian prejudices and out of control egoism that makes people so cruel and angst ridden , they either shoot little kids with machine guns or don ' t revolt against their society when something so evil happens in their midst .
