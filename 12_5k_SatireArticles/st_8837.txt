These are the people who make Britain great and she will hold her head high as she takes her rightful place in the New World Order we all work so diligently towards , where force not reason will hold sway , greed not compassion , demoralized control freaks , not considerate human beings , nihilism and self abuse , not spiritual values or individual destiny : Where training and recruitment of egocentric , alienated belligerents will keep you all submissive and fearful of one another and totally at the mercy of our computer driven , fascist bureaucracy without which our interests can neither be concealed from prying eyes nor yield , regular , mind blowing profits for we worthy few . Would there be any charities if you , the Sheeple , did not work harder and harder and ever more selflessly to make us richer ?
