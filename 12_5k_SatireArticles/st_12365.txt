He She has more than Carter has liver pills : " This theorom was disproved as Carter Products no longer produces Liver Pills . Mr Carter , the man who invented these shortly after the Civil War , has been dead for many years and no longer owns any stock in his company , and therefore does not have any actual liver pills in his possession . Additionally , the name of the pill was changed and the word " liver " was removed in the 1950s . Former President Jimmy Carter was detained on a trip to build a house for six hours and the FBI confirmed that he also carried no liver pills . During our study , we learned that the company who purchased Carter Products also owns Trojan Condoms . Much use and research was done with this product in order to learn that it has nothing to do with liver pills . People may now safely stop using this expression and we suggest using one of the others that has been proven . "
