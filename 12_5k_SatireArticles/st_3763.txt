" Okay , let ' s get this straight , " said defense minded power forward Joey Dorsey , who spent most of the day denying that he was a friendly troll , a brave knight , or even an evil ogre . " The point is , there ' s this thing that ' s hard to do and there ' s more than one part to it , like spinning straw into gold while trying to outwit evil magic gnomes or like trying to win the basketball tournament while everyone says you ' re not good enough . So you have to be crafty , like saying you can do something you can ' t while someone who can do the things you can ' t does them until you outfox them and then you ' re a princess or the champion Wait . No , you ' re both . Right ? "
