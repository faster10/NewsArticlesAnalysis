Upon being asked if the prayers of fans were also answered and if they are also rewarded for their prayers , the Pope said when their teams win that shows the prayers of the fans have been answered . And when their teams lose , it is a test of their faith . The reward of all fans is that they get to watch the games live . " How many people are fortunate enough to be able to afford to attend these sporting events ? Those who are so fortunate are being rewarded for their faith and prayers . "
