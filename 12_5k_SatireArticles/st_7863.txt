The Fashion Hospital has released this statement in conjunction with the family which showbiz commentators have rejected as PR spin to hide the real truth . " Being a high profile fashion visionary , and brand consultant guardian of David Beckham ' s image , plus having a new celebrity baby are roles that require superhuman strength . This is on top of her unpaid charitable works as a British cultural ambassador to LA , and fixer , counsellor and stylist to her celebrity friends . Victoria has had very little time to think of the next round of ideas and so needs to take a break from her legions of fans both in the old and new world . Her collection and creative input to the fashion industry and to the LA scene are not at risk . We see it like a vintage garment that needs to be cleaned and spruced up in order to looks its best . Victoria is an asset to the USA and living the LA dream . She will be back soon for the new season but now her family ask that this quiet creative period is respected . "
