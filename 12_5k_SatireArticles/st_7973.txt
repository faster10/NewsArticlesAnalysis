" All of this has met with too much opposition , " Jacobson continued . " We have tried proselytizing in the effort to inculcate everyone . But that has yet to pan out . Presently , we are attempting to wall ourselves off from the rest of society by co opting and creating our own acceptable Christian approved world here on God ' s green earth . But that is becoming much too tedious , complicated , and time consuming . So , we feel this venture , as gargantuan as it may seem , will prove to be both expedient and cost effective toward finally reaching our goals . Besides , this will make it a lot easier for God , come time for the Rapture . " Michael Carlucci 2013
