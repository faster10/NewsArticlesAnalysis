" The purpose of the Second Amendment is to secure our ability to oppose enemies foreign and domestic , a guarantee against disorder and tyranny . Consider the words of Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story : The importance of this article will scarcely be doubted by any persons , who have duly reflected upon the subject . The militia is the natural defense of a free country against sudden foreign invasions , domestic insurrections , and domestic usurpations of power by rulers . It is against sound policy for a free people to keep up large military establishments and standing armies in time of peace , both from the enormous expenses , with which they are attended , and the facile means , which they afford to ambitious and unprincipled rulers , to subvert the government , or trample upon the rights of the people . The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered , as the palladium of the liberties of a republic since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers and will generally , even if these are successful in the first instance , enable the people to resist and triumph over them .
