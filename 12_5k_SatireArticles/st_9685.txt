If what she found wasn ' t strange enough , Mrs Hoax ' s version of how she found them is even more bizarre . She alleges that as she was dusting on Saturday morning , she heard a tiny giggle coming from behind the old tv record player combo in her bedroom . She paid little attention and continued . Moments later , she heard a sneeze , which was a little harder to ignore . " First , I hears this laugh like sound and I didn ' t think much of it . Then there ' s this sneezing sound , and it reminded me of my Henry ' s sneeze . I never heard Henry giggle or laugh , so I can ' t speak on that . I can say that I was getting the heebee jeebees " .
