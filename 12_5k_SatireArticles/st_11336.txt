Pamela Cranson , a visiting archaeologist from Stanford University , who also has a Ph . D . in open mindedness , expressed her opinion , " It seems that after thousands of years of lies , deceit , prevarication and redundancy in the highest rings of the Catholic Church , we have discovered that Christ ' s original intention was not for us to eat his body and drink his blood , because that ' s just crazy . Rather we are to gather for him the body and blood of others as a penitential sacrifice for our wrongdoings . "
