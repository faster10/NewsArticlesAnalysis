" My teeth are a mess , I ' m always getting work done . I ' ll admit that I never floss and only brush occasionally but I ' ve got good insurance so what ' s the point . I just let the pro ' s do the heavy lifting . " Ms . Porter continued " So I get to the office . Barely made the appointment because the service elevator was out so I had to walk around one of those wheel chair ramps . . . . looking back I should ' ve used the stairs but I don ' t like the exertion . I get to the office and go straight back they know me real well and all . . . . "
