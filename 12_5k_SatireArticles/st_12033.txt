The CDC , taking no chances issued a bulletin warning US citizens of it ' s concerns . " The Center wishes to advise all Democrats to thoroughly wash any vegetables being sold under the counter at The First Lady ' s Farmer ' s Market as they may be contaminated by a deadly strain of E Coli which may cause death , or even worse ! Those of you in NYC also be on the alert for contaminated Hot Dogs , and we urge all Liberals to thoroughly boil any Weiners before you put them in your mouth ! ( hmmm , hmmm , hmmm ! )
