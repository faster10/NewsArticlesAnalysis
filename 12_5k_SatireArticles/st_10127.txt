The team was seen later at Valhalla Bar Grill on 1222nd Street . From this point , details are sketchy at best , ( but eye witnesses have provided an in depth account of what happened , as if they were the guys from Bungee ) . It is said that there was a newcomer to the local haunt who recognized one of the men from an interview done some years ago . This isn ' t typical because these gentlemen are the behind the scenes types who normally only appear as the credits scroll .
