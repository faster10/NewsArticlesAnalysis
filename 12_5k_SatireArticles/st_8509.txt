Tight End Vernon Davis who caught his second touchdown , after catching his first of the season last week , concurred . " Everyone ' s scared man " I mean when he sent me to the showers early during the Seattle game , on my way to the locker room , I kept thinking about whether he was gonna destroy my car with a sledge hammer or something you know crazy irrational stuff like that . You just don ' t know with him . You see the way he puts his hands on his knees and stares ahead like an unfocussed madman . No one knows if he knows what ' s going on or is just faking it , or is just pissed . "
