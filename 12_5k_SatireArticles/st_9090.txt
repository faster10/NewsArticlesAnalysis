" It ' s not that we agree with the situation in Tibet " , one passenger told us , " It ' s just that I don ' t think London tube drivers striking is going to make any difference to China ' s international policies . It ' s the same with the donkeys . They can go on strike for a year but the donkeys will still be there when they get back to work . Probably more , in fact , because they ' ll not be mowed every day down by the trains . "
