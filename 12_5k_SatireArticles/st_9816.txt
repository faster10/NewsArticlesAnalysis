A local Louisiana furniture shop , Olinde ' s furniture has responded by circulating a " AWM American ' s with Mirrors " petition that suggests it is up to the individual to use the mirror with discretion and take responsibility for whatever is reflected . They also cited the similar logic in upholding gun ownership , " We don ' t blame the guns , why blame mirrors ? " When presented with the petition , Jindal reflected ( not into a mirror , though ) , and said , " Guns are my heritage , mirrors are not . "
