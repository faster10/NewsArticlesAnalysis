Once order is restored , 10 lucky Russians who are brought to Moscow , courtesy of the show , by ox cart face off in a " fastest finger " round to determine who will sit in the " hot seat " in front of Ivaskevich to compete for the nutrient containing jackpot . The advancing contestant is asked a series of increasingly difficult questions , each carrying a larger food prize , from a scrap of rotting cabbage to the grand prize of a one course dinner for one . Stumped contestants can use one of three " lifelines " polling the audience , writing a letter to a friend for help , or ingesting a packet of glucose syrup if they are losing consciousness due to hunger .
