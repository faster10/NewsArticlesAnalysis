The UAW is calling for a new contract guaranteeing each GM worker a new cap every eight months , with at least one of the first three caps featuring profanity , such as , " What Part Of ' Eat Shit ' Don ' t You Understand ? " " Lazy Americans , My Ass ! " and " Shut Up , Bitch ! " As a further concession , the union is demanding that all workers with 10 years service receive three quarter sleeve T shirts bearing the iron on slogan , " Wanted : Good Woman With Bass Boat . . . Send Picture Of Boat . "
