" Look , you want white teeth so damn bad ? It ' s simple , " Jones said . " Don ' t smoke , stay away from coffee , tea , and soda , brush and floss regularly , and go to your dentist every six months . Sure , have your teeth whitened occasionally , but keep in mind that we can only go far as the technology allows . When someone creates a better teeth whitening procedure , we ' ll slap an ' ultra ' on it and get it out on the market as fast as the FDA allows . Until then , be happy with what you have . Americans really need to learn to live with almost total perfection . "
