Amy Winehouse who is no stranger to publicity said " Pete and I have been having a rotten time with the British media . They report on everything we do and we are having serious problems scoring our next fix of gear on which our lives depend . We figure that the return of Gary Glitter will take all the media attention and persecution away from us so to show our gratitude we thought the least we could do was pay tribute by way of thanks to Gary . Thanks Gary . . . we will sure get neatly out of our brains thanks to you coming home . Welcome back Gary ! "
