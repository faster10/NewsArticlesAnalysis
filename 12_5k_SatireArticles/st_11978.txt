The first Ted dealt with an adult man whose Teddy Bear has come to life to present a Greek Chorus on his life . We preferred such a device to be a talking horse like Mr Ed to do this work . We know enough about modern movies to realize that the sequel is not going to rival A Midsummer Night ' s Dream . It may not even rival Francis the Talking Mule . But , Tom Brady will not do anything to bring dishonor to his career . It will be watchable .
