Fast forward to the NFL , where quarterbacks that make the cut can hit a dime at 60 yards with scintillating spirals . Even as a Gator , Tebow wasn ' t known for long passes he was accurate , but mostly threw shorter 25 or 30 yards , tops . And in the Patriots ' exhibition games , well , it looked like they could ' ve pulled some guy hanging around a Boston bus stop to do the job Tim was doing . Even Bernie Kosar , who ran around like a billy goat with three broken legs , seemed to have a global tracking device attached to his arm . And Bernie would ' ve rather put on the other team ' s jersey than run the ball up the middle .
