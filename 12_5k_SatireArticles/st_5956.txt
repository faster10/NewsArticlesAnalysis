" A truck pulled up to the school one afternoon and a couple men got out , " Kramarczyk recalled . " They were carrying in boxes . A day later , I could see a bunch of egg incubators on the windowsills of one of the classrooms . Then , a couple weeks later , as I was walking the dog near the school , I heard peeping noises . Why ' d those kids need to hatch eggs ? Aren ' t there farms that do that sort of thing ? It just don ' t add up . "
