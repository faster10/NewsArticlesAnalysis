President of the Little Divot biscuit society , Jamie Dodger , doesn ' t see the funny side of it . He told us , " It may not be illegal but it breaks with tradition and conformity . Frankly , I ' m shaken beyond comprehension at this horrific news . It ' s yet another example of everything that ' s wrong with this country . It ' s bad enough seeing poncey coffee being served in the village , but someone having the brass neck to do what he did , well , it takes the biscuit . He ' s the sort of uncouth , culturally ignorant moron who probably thinks a Jaffa cake is really a biscuit . I ' m outraged . Absolutely outraged . "
