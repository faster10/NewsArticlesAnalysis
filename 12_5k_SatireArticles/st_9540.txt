Few Potlandians take up Mr Wino ' s offer . Doctor Morris Pothead explains the difference between the drugs . " The thing is , nicotine and alcohol are capitalistic drugs , engineered to dehumanize the users , whereas cannabis is a natural entheogen , which means it ' s a drug that gives you religious experiences . Nicotine is a stimulant and a relaxant . When you smoke it , you become both relaxed and sharp , which makes you a more productive worker . That ' s why nicotine is legal in hyper capitalistic countries : it ' s good for the economy even if it ' s terrible for the people ' s spiritual well being .
