A far greater threat to the Woodland Pals came in the form of Hoofington P . McSnort , a local bull who became enraged when he discovered that his pasture was being used as the setting for the Woodland Pals ' jamboree . McSnort , who has a history of antagonistic behavior toward the Pals , charged at the music making critters , sending them scattering throughout the pasture . Though McSnort aggressively pursued all animals within his proximity , his primary target appeared to be the portly Oliver Oink , whose posterior was gored by the bull ' s razor sharp horns .
