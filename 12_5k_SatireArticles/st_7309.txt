In a press release he stated , " For the last time . That song isn ' t about having a good time and partying , it ' s obviously about the massacre of the thousands of innocents during the Bosnian War . It annoys me that people can ' t see that and when the song comes on they just dance and scream and get their breasts out . I don ' t want them to dance with their breasts out I want them to think with their breasts out . Possibly their vaginas too . "
