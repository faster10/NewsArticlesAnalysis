The village of about 2 , 500 people was on the verge of cashing in on the natural gas fracking boom ( Marcellus Shale Field ) , which was expected to revitalize the surrounding area by creating additional jobs locally and across the border in nearby Pennsylvania . The village had two donut coffee shops , two fast food restaurants , several pizza parlors and small fine dining cafes , two gun shops ( great deer hunting area at Salt Creek ) , a supermarket , a single liquor store , a salted pretzel factory , an ice cream factory , a soda bottling plant and a car dealership auto repair shop .
