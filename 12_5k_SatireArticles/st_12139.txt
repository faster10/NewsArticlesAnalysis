Another famous New Jersey rocker is Jon Bon Jovi . Bon Jovi has about a hundred acres of prime New Jersey real estate . But only pays about one hundred ( that ' s 100 . 00 ) a year in property taxes . OK , I know you ' re really interested now , so how does he do it ? I ' ll give you the buzz It ' s bees ! Yes , having an apiary , or colonies of honey bees , allows you certain property tax exemptions , plus money from the honey crop . I ' m not sure , but I can ' t remember a single lyric in any of Bon Jovi ' s songs that relate to the love of bees !
