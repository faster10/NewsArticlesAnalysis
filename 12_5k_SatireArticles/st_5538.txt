" Robert always wanted his work to affect the broadest possible audience , and by introducing children to the wonders of the human form and hardcore homoeroticism at a young age , we hope to instill a lifelong appreciation for his art , " said head curator Eileen Greco , dressed in the standard leather bondage harness worn by all Mapplethorpe Children ' s Museum guides . " This museum is a celebration of everything Robert loved from muscular male thighs to nylon cords wrapped tightly around one ' s own scrotum and our interactive exhibits make it fun for even the youngest child to explore and enjoy these themes .
