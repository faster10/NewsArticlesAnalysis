Victoria ear piercing cockney accent troubled and shocked the polite folk of the restaurant who complained why they had let a meth head into such an establishment and that she was turning them off their food . But the diners were not able to understand the shocking things she was saying due to her accent and so didn ' t realise the severity of what was going on . In her series of rants she demanded burger and chips , something which she hasn ' t eaten in public since the millennium . In a clear sign of her worsening hallucinations , Victoria was pointing at her new born baby , Harper Seven who she was convinced was her meal . Vinnie Jones cleared the restaurant and warned anyone not to talk to the media , after which the family sedated her so they could finish the meal in peace .
