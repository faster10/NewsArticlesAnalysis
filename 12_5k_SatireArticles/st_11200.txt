" I ' m going to miss him to tell you the truth , " long time business rival Lucifer said candidly . " Everyone has this idea we hated each other or something , like we were out to get each other , but we actually were perfect compliments for each other , you know . Shoot , I had a lot of respect for the guy , ever since we had that Temptation in the Desert thing he really earned my respect that day . I guess he just wasn ' t willing to change , which you have to do in this religion biz . Look at me with the Evil business . For centuries , it was cake . All I had to do was scare some kids , possess a soul now and then , and I was earning a nice living . Now , just to turn a profit , I have to outsource most of my work to guys like Cheney and Rumsfeld . They say I drive a hard bargain . Try dealing with them . Anyway , I wish him luck . "
