But the real genius came when Mersch ' s experimentation led to his " illumination activation system " utilizing trace minerals found in common roadway asphalt . Blending those particles into the meal fed to the deer caused a 300 increase in brightness to the otherwise not so bright animals . In essence , when such modernized deer touches an asphalt road in the evening , it will begin to light up like a large , hairy , four legged , 300 watt bulb , with 600 watt glowing eyes . Back in the woods , deer will be only a mere 4 watt curiosity opening up the possibility for the first ever nighttime deer hunting .
