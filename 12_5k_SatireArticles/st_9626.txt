And I can use that pen to sign executive orders . Not only that , I ' ve got about 4 , 000 atomic bombs . I won . . . TWICE ! I Double Dare Boehner to sue me . You think you can sic that Bee yatch Supreme Court on me ? I punch the Red Button in my office . You ' ll wish you never crossed me . We ' re playin ' Chicago rules now .
