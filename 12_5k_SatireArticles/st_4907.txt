" It was really getting out of control , " said Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith . " The pope is the gatekeeper between piety and anarchy . Without a papal presence , Catholics were thinking impure thoughts , manipulating their own genitals , and acting as if homosexuality was no big deal . Thank goodness we gathered to choose the new pope , or God ' s Kingdom on Earth might look like Sodom and Gomorrah by now . "
