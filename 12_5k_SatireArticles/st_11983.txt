About five years later , I saw Bill Russell driving down Arlington Street in Boston , perhaps heading to Storrow Drive to go over to the old Boston Garden one afternoon . I was driving in the car directly behind him . Once again , I watched as people on the street stopped and looked at him when we came to a red light . Then , the man who had brought so many championships to Boston suffered the indignity of having a hooligan screaming slurs at him from the sidewalk . I was stunned . For the first time in my life I actually saw racism in Boston first hand .
