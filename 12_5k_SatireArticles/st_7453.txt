As with Playboy , The Saturday Evening Post has been dealing with questions of its existence . In its heyday , the magazine was among those magazines which were aimed at a general readership much on the lines of such rivals as Life , Look or Collier ' s .

A few years ago , the Post brought back its logo from the 1940s many had thought the bi monthly had ceased publication .
