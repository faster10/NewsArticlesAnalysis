Now I ' m open to people saying the word " cunt . " Saying " cunt is every Canadian ' s right . It ' s just sometimes at breakfast , before a long day at work , you don ' t need to hear the words " Whatchya get up to last night ? I only see one pair of shoes , so I guess it was another swing and miss , there eh ? Come home all pissed , with a bag of cheetos , and a lady in the old spank bank . I bet you woke up with cheese dust all over you dick . Didn ' t yeah you horny little cunt . "
