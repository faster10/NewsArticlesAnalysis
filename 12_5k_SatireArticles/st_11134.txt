People volunteer their services for free for many reasons . They might want something useful to do after they have retired from paid work . They might want the good feeling that comes from helping others . They might want work experience if they are unemployed . They might simply want to spend some time with other people doing useful work . They might volunteer for any or all of these reasons or for other more personal ones . Whatever their reasons , volunteers give their time freely to fill many of the gaps in the service of other people .
