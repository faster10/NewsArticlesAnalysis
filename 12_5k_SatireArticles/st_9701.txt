Ted Hussein Cruz , who is eyeing a run for president in 2016 , also attacked this " wolf in papal robes " when he explained : " He clearly doesn ' t understand the true meaning of Christianity . I ' m not sure what kind of socialist upbringing he ' s had , but true Christian principles are found in taking from the poor not giving to them . How will the poor ever better themselves if we don ' t make them work for it , at a very low paying wage ? We can ' t continue to let Obamacare corrupt the Pope , which it clearly has . "
