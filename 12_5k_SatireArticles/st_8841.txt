His other thefts included a 45 chameleon lizard from Bearwood Pets in Smethwick , which was harder to prove because these types of lizards tend to blend into their surroundings , therefore the shop ' s CCTV was unable to see him leave the store with the lizard a piranha worth 100 from the Beacon Pet Aquarium in Sundial Lane , Great Barr a clownfish worth 80 from MG Marines in Churchfield Street , Dudley a parrot worth 60 from Two by Two in the Merry Hill Shopping Centre , Brierley Hill , again this was hard to prove because he taught the parrot to speak out in his defense when it was interviewed by West Midlands Police .
