The so called Sun Devils ( students ) at ASU are unable to control their school spirit . It is unnatural for them to have so much faith in the athletics and academic programs .

The students are not even aware of the fact that this degree of pride is offensive to other colleges , which inevitably become jealous of it . Baker reiterated , " It is clear that attendees of ASU are more likely to be mauled by a bear in the desert than agree to ' Bear Down ' to their rival University of Arizona . " This demonstrates their unlikelihood to listen to critics of this appalling and unnecessary behavior .
