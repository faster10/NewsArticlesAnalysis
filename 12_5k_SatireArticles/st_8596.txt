" The only thing that disgusts me more then the crime that ' s been committed is the reaction from the general public . My child ' s life has been permanently altered , yet the discussion is focused on the intentions or merits of this famous athlete . What kind of country do we live in ? This isn ' t some kind of game , it ' s the life of a human being and the way it has been dealt with publicly makes me want to punch the shit out of a kitten . Maybe that ' s out of line , but I don ' t care , I ' m pissed and I won ' t stop until this famous athlete is condemned by the public for his inexcusable behavior . I promise , on my child ' s life , I will fight for justice until this extremely popular , successful and beloved athlete faces the proper repercussions for his actions . "
