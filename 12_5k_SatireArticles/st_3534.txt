" I suppose it ' s corny , but the older I get , the more I long for that ideal town with ball fields and picket fences and relaxing evening strolls down tree lined streets past friendly white neighbors , " said Jensen , who lamented that during his time living in the city he ' s never really felt like part of a close knit white community . " I want to be able to sit on my front porch with a glass of lemonade knowing that I live in a place where white folks look out for each other . That ' s where I ' m most comfortable . "
