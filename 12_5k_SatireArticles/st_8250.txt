You see , ever since I was a small kid , I have been bullied , beaten up and pushed around every single day . So much so , I had to come up with something creative to solve my problems . So when I was about 11 years old , as soon as I saw my classmates or anyone else coming near me , I began to automatically throw myself to the ground , start rolling all over the floor pretending to be in agonizing pain ! I was essentially victimizing myself for others to see , with the hope that they would show some pity and go away feeling that they had achieved what they wanted without having put in much effort !
