Stephen Varga , a frequent beachcomber in the Ocala area , witnessed the mother ' s act of gross criminal negligence . " She waddled inland along the shore , oh , 200 to 300 yards or so , " Varga said , " and I remember thinking how suspicious the whole thing looked , the way she used her hind feet to carefully dig a shallow , gourd shaped depression in a secluded section of coast , far removed from possible predatory attacks by terns , ospreys or other sea birds . It gave me chills . "
