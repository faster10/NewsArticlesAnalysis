" This employee , who ' s name escapes me at the moment , was dismissed for gross misconduct , in that he lent money to another person knowing that it would be repaid . While doing so he also failed to charge an administration fee or add exorbitant cumulative interest . As an employee of long standing he was well aware that the guiding principle of any financial transaction is to insure that interest is paid throughout the debtor ' s lifetime as the rates should be set , such as that the debtor can never quite pay off the original loan . The fact that it was his own money is beside the point " .
