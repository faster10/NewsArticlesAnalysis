Several elves that did not partake in the " smoke out " were angry by the " tokers " behavior . " They giggle all night , eat cookies in bed , get crumbs all over the place and they stink , " one pissed off elf said . " I ' m tired of them keeping me awake all night , " said another . " Yesterday , they were up all night watching old re runs of Perry Mason , and just cracking up . What ' s so damn funny about that show , I ' d like to know ? "
