Esther and Homer Cougar would not respond to our calls or knocks on the door . Actually our only call ended with her saying , ' That ' s all I gotta say ' . But Daisy Lou across the road told us that Esther says that it ' s not bad at all having a wild animal like Homer Cougar at night but that she was busy all morning cleaning up after ' Coug ' had sprayed his territory before he leaves for work as a dishwasher at the Bates Motel Restaurant .
