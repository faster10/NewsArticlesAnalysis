" Why exactly President Carter was even carrying two bags of groceries in downtown Washington , D . C . when he lives in Georgia , I have no idea , " the president went on to say . " And why he was buying groceries at 2 a . m . we ' ll never know . And perhaps I should stop going on my late night drives to clear my head . But none of that matters now . I ' m sorry about this . I am so , so sorry . Goddammit ! "
