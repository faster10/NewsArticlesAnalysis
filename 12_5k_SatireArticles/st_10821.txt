He ' s a smart guy . I ' m thinking it ' ll be something with a chicken , maybe a run in with a mascot Hey , he ' s got a big interview coming up next Tuesday . Leave it to Mit Romney to find a way to get punched in the crotch by Barbara Walters . Whatever happens I ' m sure it will be brilliant and hilarious . "
