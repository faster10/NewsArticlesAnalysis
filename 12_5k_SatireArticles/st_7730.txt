When one young Tolkienist by the name of Elrondil was interviewed by our correspondent as to why the Tolkienists were taking such offence , he replied simply this : " Well , it ' s really quite obvious that he Just Jackass is making all this up to become more of the media ' s common interest . How dare he claim that Haldir was at the battle of Helm ' s Deep , when absolutely everyone knows that he Haldir was helping the galadhrim defend the Golden Wood against the Necromancer , and there was just no way that the elves would come and help the petty men , we are far superior .
