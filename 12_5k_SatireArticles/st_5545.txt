" Obviously , I bring a lot to the table , " Pritchard said . " I ' m a broken shell of a man with nowhere else to turn and I will believe just about anything at this point , so if a religion really wants me , they ' re going to have to sweeten the pot . For instance , Hinduism is promising me rebirth as a king and the unlocking of all the secrets of the universe . But at this stage , that ' s not enough . How about throwing in some final redemption , or a car , or complete and total spiritual transcendence ? "
