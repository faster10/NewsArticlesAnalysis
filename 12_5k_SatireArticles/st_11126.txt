Best thing about watching the Australian Open is the Jennifer Aniston commercial . She ' s cute , neat and doesn ' t appear to be in need of a shower . In the commercial , she is searching for the shower during a flight . No showers ? This isn ' t an Air Emirates plane ? No snakes or showers on the plane ! A flight attendant offers a tiny towel instead . She faints at the realization she isn ' t flying Air Emirates . Next scene : It was all a nightmare .
