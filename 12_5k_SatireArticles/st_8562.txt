Three years ago I joined Staffs University Men ' s Rugby Union and thought I could give playing rugby one last go . And for the third time in my life I finally realized that I was not born to be a rugby player . I am a qualified level one rugby coach and one day off my level two , but even though I know how to teach the sport I can ' t practice what I preach . I have made few appearances off the bench for Staffs Uni and the rest of the time I have been linesman .
