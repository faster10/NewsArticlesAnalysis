Dateline August 3 , 2005 , U . S . Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld secretly orders the purchase of 35 , 000 pigs from Sichuan province in China that are infected with a new virulent strain of Streptococcus suis common in pigs but has recently jumped to humans causing nausea , fever , vomiting and bleeding under the skin and eventual convulsive death in those that handle and butcher and consume the sick pigs . The Defense Department is shipping the pigs to central Iraq where they will be set free in Sunni towns and villages where insurgents and foreign terrorists are known to be hiding under cover with the hope that due to severe food shortages people will butcher and consume the infected pigs leading to mass casualties among insurgents and some collateral damage amongst the general population .
