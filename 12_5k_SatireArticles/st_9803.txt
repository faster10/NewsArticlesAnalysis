Happy Meals promote sexism . Why do the McDonald ' s workers ask if the child receiving the meal is male or female ? What does that have to do with anything ? In 2002 a web site was put online by the mother of a victim of gender discrimination in McDonald ' s focusing on this issue . Shouldn ' t McDonalds worry about the quality of toys instead of the sex of the child ? Either way they make money . McDonald ' s is killing two birds with one stone : Happy Meals not only create a larger chance for obesity in our children , but soon the children will be obese and sexist . Why does a boy get Action Man with his cool gadgets and weapons , but a girl only gets a Barbie doll and a brush ? Are boys more precious than girls , more important ? Does McDonald ' s promote a male dominated society , with women staying at home raising children and driving them to pick up Happy Meals for lunch and dinner ? Is this how we want our society to end up ? All we can do is speculate and hope that we are wrong .
