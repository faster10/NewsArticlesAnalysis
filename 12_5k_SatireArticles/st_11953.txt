Cindy Shaeffer , who was at the Eglinton Ave . and Laird St . Mr Sub , had this to say about Saunders ' love of hot sauce : " I think he goes a little overboard sometimes . I gave him a bite of my chicken caesar sub , because he said he ' d never tried it , and I warned him that it was hot . He suddenly got this strange grin on his face , as if I ' d just told him that there were leprechauns hiding under the lettuce or something . After he ate it he said You call that hot ? ' and started to laugh . Then he pulled out a bottle of hot sauce he ' d ordered on EBay , and he ' s like , You should try this sucker . You ' d probably have a heart attack . " ' Whatever , Jeff . "
