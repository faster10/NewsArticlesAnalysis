Said Doc Nicholas , " Scrotal Hyperthermia is serious business , especially if you keep you knees together for an extended period of time . If you must continue to use your lap top on your lap , it is recommended that you spread you knees at least once every 37 seconds , unless you ' ' re wearing kilts of course , and if in a public place , surreptitiously move your scrotum around to provide thermal cooling . . . . if your balls are cramped they ' re obviously going to overheat . . . any numb nuts knows that ! "
