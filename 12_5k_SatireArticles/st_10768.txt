Portland Oregon today passed legislation which outlaws the possession or sale of pseudoephedrin based cold medicines while legalizing crystal meth . Said Governor Kulongoski , " It ' s not the drugs themselves that are the problem , it ' s the crime and tearing of the social fabric their being illegal causes . This bill will hopefully reduce the crime associated with crystal meth , while putting needed cash into the pockets of physicians . If a cold sufferer thinks he ' s going to purchase crystal meth and cook up a batch of Sudafed , we ' re going to put him behind bars .
