" I would have done anything anything to keep that man alive ! " Obama said . " He looked up at me right before the very end . I ' m not sure whether he realized it was me , or if at that moment he was thinking about of all the people to hit him with a car how strangely ironic and weird and bizarre that the president of the United States had hit him . I don ' t know whether or not he was of sound mind to think about how he , too , had been president , and how there have only been 44 presidents , and how we usually travel by motorcade , and how this probably should have been avoided from an operational and statistical standpoint . But when he looked at me , there was no hate in his eyes . "
