' Time and space came into existence 13 . 75 billion years ago with the Big Bang , ' explained Professor Brian Cox , barging past the elderly Professeur de l ' Horloge and knocking him to the ground at the sight of a TV camera . ' Space and time have been expanding ever since . Many people incorrectly believe , ' continued Professor Cox , keeping a foot firmly on the spasming windpipe of Professeur de l ' Horloge , ' that objects in the Universe are accelerating away from each other due to the explosion of the Big Bang rather like shrapnel travelling away from the site of an exploding grenade . In fact , objects in the Universe stay relatively still . It is space time , itself , that is expanding .
