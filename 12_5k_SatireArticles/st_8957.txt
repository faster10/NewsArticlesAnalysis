But not everyone agrees . Mrs Hilda Highhopes , head of the Amalgamated Union of Sheep Dog Breeders and Cattle Prod Manufacturers , spoke of her dismay at the possibility of footless cattle . " It ' s a British institution that our cattle roam freely o ' er our green and pleasant lands , " said Mrs Highhopes . " Where would we be if Sunday motorists couldn ' t stop to admire a fine bit of roadkill ? And where ' s the fun of leaving farm gates open if all the cattle can do is sit there and look at you ? "
