" The cool thing about Matt Damon is he ' s not only a good talker , but he can take action when necessary , " commented Berkelee School of Music student Guillermo Rodriguez . " He ' s really effective in the academic role he plays in Inside Job , but then in documentaries like Bourne Identity , you see that he ' s also willing to step up and make things happen . I ' m certainly not going to make any investments until I hear what he has to say about the economy . "
