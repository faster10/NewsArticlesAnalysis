I mean Jesus no disrespect by the way and I hope he rests in peace . . . wherever he is , but that is a fact . Sure , he performed miracles . Big deal ! There ' s a whole slew of magicians do tricks all over Judea . And they pull in the crowds like nothing . But , he didn ' t tell me how to do any of them or I wouldn ' t have shopped him in the first place , would I ? I had a wife and six kids to feed and two expensive mistresses , not including Mary Magdalene who was a freebie . I mean dat broad was anybody ' s for a wet fish . And you have to think of your community for crying out loud , don ' t you ? What is a man to do ?
