" I . . . I was trying to show my outrage at a man with a heavy leather jacket . And , he . . . he didn ' t even care . I called him a murderer , and all he said was , ' You can ' t prove that . ' Next thing I know is he forced me to ride on the back of his motorcycle all day , and not left me off , because his girl friend was out of town and I was almost a woman . "
