I went to go see this latest cinematic abomination with Denny , Kyle , and Chucks , my best buds ever since grade school , or so I assume because everything from that period is a swirling void in my conscious memory . We bought tickets to a different movie and snuck into the chick flick ( suck it Feig ! ) , mostly because the movie was sure to be as terrible as I had assumed ever since the moment it was announced . I ended up sitting next to this weird dude who was wearing like a big black hooded sackcloth robe . I get it if I went to see " Girlsbusters by myself on purpose , I probably wouldn ' t want people to see my face either !
