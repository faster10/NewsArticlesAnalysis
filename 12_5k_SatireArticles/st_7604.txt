" In the end , Brenda and I both signed up to star in the film . There will be some porn , nudity , and sexual tension between me and Brenda . I want to be considered a serious actor , not a tweenybopper actor . And Brenda wanted to breakout of her clean , sober image too . The film has a very interesting plot and many characters that I think people will relate too . It is definitely not a teen movie nor a porn movie . It ' s audience is mainly young adults , older and wiser groups of teens and probably several families . Many tweens will be interested in seeing this movie . Well they can it ' s rated 12A so they can watch it . The disturbing scenes will not be in the 12A version though , there is only one scene with nudity , and it is very short . "
