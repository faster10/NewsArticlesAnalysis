To serve the thousands who would show up , plus to keep off the mosque ' s property , contractors built a 25 foot long stainless trough that connected to a 2 , 000 gallon holding tank that in itself was connected to a used fire truck pumper with a working elevated hose tower . The patriotic themed fire truck was painted red white and blue with pictures of Lipshitz reading a copy of the Constitution on the hood . The event is to be held on adjacent private property donated for the event .
