" One by one , subscribers told me they were getting rid of their machines , until it was just me left . And then , buying my late night shish before heading upstairs to check my emails I noticed the machine in the corner of Ali ' s shop . It was an emotional moment for me . Made even sadder by the fact that Ali decided to sell his machine when I explained to him we were the only two owners of faxes in the UK , and I live upstairs so had no need to fax him "
