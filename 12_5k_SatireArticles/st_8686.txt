' We have obtained our most accurate results by utilising a calibration schema based upon Uprattler , Prondle Lipschitz ' s Quasi Dangling Arrays , with some attention to Nindus Wetmantle ' s 1975 paper on the Lateral Tranching technique first introduced by Gunnar Milt at Uppsala in the 1950s . Gunnar Milt made use of a ' swarm ' of half demijohns and this has been the inspiration for Nindus Wetmantle , and of course for the Autoplastic Demijohns of Professor Jens Convolvulus of Jutland , not to mention my own ideas in relation to Embedded Vein Quantifications , which have had their most practical application in the measurements of the apparently fluctuating height of the Longstone on Mottistone Down on the Isle of Wight , a monument often claimed to be growing or shrinking in a supernatural manner .
