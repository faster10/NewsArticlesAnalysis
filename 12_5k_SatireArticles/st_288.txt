" Dad always used to exaggerate his experience of the 1960s , but now he ' s totally gone , " said Dylan Finster , who recently moved his father Harold into managed care . " It was bad enough when he would go on and on about being at Woodstock , and how it completely changed the world for the better . But these days , not only did Woodstock change the world , he was also airlifted out of Hanoi with Jimi Hendrix , Janis Joplin , and Jefferson Airplane in 1969 . "
