That is why we send the royals over as often as we can and alert our media functionaries there to make the biggest possible to do about their visits . However , this has proven very expensive . So , we figured it would be cheaper all round . . . if we just house them there . Not all of them of course the Queen Mother , the Duke and Charles can still live in Buckingham Palace but the rest will find Canberra , we are sure , most agreeable . Besides , they will have Skype . One thing is for certain , the Ozzies won ' t be voting for independence next time around . We will see to it that they have photos of William and Kate , Harry and Andrew hanging in their living rooms by the time we are through or Nelson did not fight at Trafalgar . Once we have totally secured our dominion we will bring them home . We are most sincerely grateful to U . S . president Obama for pledging to help us in this pursuit . "
