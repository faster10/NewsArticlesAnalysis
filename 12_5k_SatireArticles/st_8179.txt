The faculties of several medical schools held emergency meetings about the decision . Harvard Medical School released a brief statement as follows : " The inclusion of anti scientific superstitions in medical school classes is totally ridiculous . Harvard Medical School positively will not go along with this decision . " On the other hand , the ( unaccredited ) Love of God Medical School ( LGMS ) issued a comment in praise of the decision , " We at LGMS have always supported the biblical approach . We already have courses in ' Demonic Possession " along with such advanced topics as ' Astrology ' , ' Palmistry ' , and ' " Necromancy ' . LGMS is far ahead of the crowd . "
