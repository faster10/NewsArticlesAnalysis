" I look around and I see Sen . Bob Bennett , Sen . Saxby Chambliss , eosinophilic and megakaryoblastic leukemia , and Sen . Pat Roberts , and I think , ' This is what the Republican Party is all about , ' " Sen . McConnell said . " We don ' t like this new bill . We don ' t like that it will cut the national deficit by 1 . 3 trillion over the next 20 years . We don ' t like that it ' s now illegal for insurance companies to suddenly drop a parent for getting deathly ill . That ' s why we ' re so very proud to be working with leukemia . "
