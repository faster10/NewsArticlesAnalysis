Agassi : " No ! ! And like I said , it really affected my play . I know it cost me The Australian Open in ' 92 I think it was ? I mean , I remember serving for the match at one point and still it was constantly on my mind , ' make sure it doesn ' t pop out , make sure it ' s tucked in good , make sure no one can see that it ' s black . ' It was all I thought about . I mean , imagine trying to stuff two extra balls into those pockets with that tree trunk in there ! "
