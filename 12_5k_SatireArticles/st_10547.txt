The controversy surrounding the coin toss started at the first debate when a one cent coin , the " penny , " was used . Democrats immediately jumped on the choice of the penny as it features the likeness of the reknowned Republican president , Abraham Lincoln , over concerns that it could influence undecided voters to choose Republican candidate . In a heated verbal exchange between Democratic strategist , James Carville , and his wife , Republican strategist Mary Matilin , Carville told his wife , " That ' s a really cheap shot , Mary , choosing a penny . " Matilin retorted with " Oh shut up , James , it was your turn today to pick up the kids , and where were you , huh ? "
