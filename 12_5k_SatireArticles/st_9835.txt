While Michael was talking , Jesse quietly submerged and swam under Gloria . When Michael stopped talking , Jesse rose up between Gloria ' s legs , and lifted her onto his shoulders and out of the water . Jesse sang , " White or black , I ' ll lift you on my back . Scratch my back , I ' ll scratch your back . We all swim in the same pool . Let ' s salute , not pollute . Glory to Gloria . On your knees . . . she has the keys . "
