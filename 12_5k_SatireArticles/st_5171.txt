The bill , H . R . 702 , stipulates that immediately upon its passage into law , the 4 , 000 brave soldiers who have lost their lives in Iraq come marching triumphantly over the horizon , directly into the arms of their loved ones , looking the same as they did on the day they left home . Article II , Section 3 of the bill requires that each soldier be carrying one apple pie , to be consumed in full with family members as they sit around the dinner table and laugh and sing . A proviso in Article III states that everything will go back to the way it was before .
