" In the US economy we have a set number of jobs currently there are 197 , 543 , 194 jobs and when we admit an immigrant , the only way he can work is if someone else , an American , gives up his job . Now in this case , unfortunately , it wasn ' t consensual so it ' s a bit more complicated . Of course it should be pointed out that children will also eventually " steal " our jobs when the become adults and enter the work force . We should be looking at policies to deport children to other countries to steal their jobs , so the American economy can continue to grow . "
