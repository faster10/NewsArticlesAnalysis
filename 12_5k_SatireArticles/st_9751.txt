The 5th grader believes black holes give birth to multiple universes . His theory is that once the singularity deep in the gravity well of a black hole reaches critical mass and goes catastrophic from eating everything in it ' s path over billions of years , it tears a rift in the fabric of space and time tearing into sub space . Once that rift is established all the matter and dark matter and energy the black hole has collected squirts into sub space like detergent out of a dish washing soap bottle . Voila the birth of a universe . He goes on to theorize that it may take the combined efforts of two massive black holes that merge together when galaxies collide to reach the density required for critical mass .
