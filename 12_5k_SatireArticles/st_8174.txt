So , what ' s it all about ? Food and calories are NOT , as previously believed , inseparable . And there IS accounting for taste . Flavors , colors and consistencies are absolutely unaffected by the revolutionary separation of calorie from cuisine . And the great thing is that , once the separation is complete , any post processed food item , no matter how previously perishable , can be left out in the sitting out with no worry about spoilage . And , to top that off , no refrigeration is required , unless you want the food cold on purpose . Surprisingly , it ' s the calories , not the food , that spoils . But , again , the magic doesn ' t end there . The calories are themselves neutralized as a result of the process and they become unaffected by exposure to air or temperature fluctuations .
