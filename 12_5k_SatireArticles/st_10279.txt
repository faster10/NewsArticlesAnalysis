Manufacturers are already jumping on the band wagon to develop products for this new technology . Mai Anus , product manager for Energizer batteries had this to say . " Our current Energizer Bunny is the perfect mascot for our new product extension , the VD cell . The VD Cell or Virtual D Cell battery employs encryption technology developed by Microsoft . This battery will make all other batteries and older battery powered appliances obsolete . These batteries will work in any flashlight , dildo or other battery powered appliance that is VD1 . 0 compliant . Cookies will actually be saved in the battery so that the consumer will be able to monitor how their batteries are used . "
