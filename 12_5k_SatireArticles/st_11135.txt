A spokesperson for Volunteering Australia said that " Volunteers are the backbone of many charities . Without volunteer workers charities would have far less money to spend on their needy clients . " He added that a good organisation will appreciate its volunteers and show them that they are appreciated . Since volunteers aren ' t being paid money and are providing useful services they should be rewarded with appreciation . He suggested that " There ' s no need to go overboard : An occasional ' Thank you ! ' or ' Good work ! ' will go down well , as will being treated as a little bit special . "
