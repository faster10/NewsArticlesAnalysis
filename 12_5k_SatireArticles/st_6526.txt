" It ' s official I ' m back , " said Uncle Greg , outlining plans to attend his first major family function in nearly three years . " All my hard work the past few months has been leading up to this : holding down a job , easing up on the booze a bit , getting myself a decent haircut . And at 12 : 30 p . m . on Saturday , Aug . 7 , all the naysayers will be silenced when they see the new Uncle Greg in top form . "
