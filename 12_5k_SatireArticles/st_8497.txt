" It was just a case of crossed wires . When we approached Juande on the Monday he was on holiday in Zimbabwe . It ' s a squad game these days . We needed cover for his position so we asked Cundy on the Tuesday . By Wednesday Juande was back from Zimbabwe after a 2 day plane delay and on Thursday we realised we couldn ' t pay Cundy till the following Monday so he suggested the cheaper option of Alex Rae . We didn ' t consider that option . "
