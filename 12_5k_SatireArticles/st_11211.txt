There is also a lake of nuclear waste almost as large as the Honey Island Swamp in Louisiana . It glows in the dark and catches fire during the day , even in times of teeming sheets of rain . The deep , thick , soupy mess is colored a psychedelic mix of purple , green , orange , blue , purple and red . Fly ash from the lake floats in the air like swarms of mosquitos . Inhaling these poisonous flakes and particulates would be about as dangerous as drinking Drano . Some hooligan kids drunk and up to no good during spring break a few years ago decided to go skinny dipping in this neon like swamp and the next day , all that was left were their skeletons . When the Gateway to Death Police Department found their remains , these victims stuck out from the swamp surface like insects caught in a fly tape .
