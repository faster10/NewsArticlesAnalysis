I looked over at Dave one of the salesman . A burly guy who once played for a professional NFL team , his eyes were moist and his knuckles were white from gripping the chair back he used to steady himself . He knew , as well as myself , that this was the opening attack of a war . Suddenly , a report flashed on the screen of a loud explosion being heard in Washington , DC . Some reporters in DC thought it was near the Treasury Building , some said it was the Pentagon . To us in the office it was a numbing overload of insecurity and creeping , chilling fear . We were at war with an unknown enemy and it was just in the beginning moments . We didn ' t know what was next or what the next target would be . Connie tried calling her relatives in New York , but the lines were clogged with hundreds of thousands callers as well , only adding to her anxiety and fear for her relatives . Linda , my assistant , fielded calls from our employees still in the field who had heard scant reports but wondered what was going on . My eyes were glued to the TV , hoping the Trade Center workers were being helped to safety and wondered how they were going to put the fire out . Reports came in of people trapped in upper floors , calmly phoning loved ones and authorities asking when help would arrive . For some it never came , as scores of people ended their lives by jumping from the building , forced to window ledges by the intense heat and thick , black smoke . We sat there quietly Simply because we were stunned .
