One resident expressed her transformation from Liberal to Conservative after Harper ' s powerful speech . " I won ' t lie , " she said , " I voted for Ignatieff . But after seeing Harper ' s speech , I think I ' ve changed my mind . I used to be concerned about things like expanding our civil liberties , but Mr Harper has made me realize these things are hard work , and that we ' re better off looking at re examining the REAL issues : gay marriage and abortion .
