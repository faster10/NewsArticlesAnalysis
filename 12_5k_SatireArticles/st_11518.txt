There are thousands of men who are accused of being involved in problems with women who are living in other countries and Interpol has not gone after those men . Why is one single individual , whose criminal charges were dropped because the charges were discovered not to be true and is now in a double jeopardy case , being sought by Interpol . And why are the charges being reintroduced right after a mega distribution of secret files ? Because Interpol is a political tool used by foreign countries to hunt down people they consider political prisoners .
