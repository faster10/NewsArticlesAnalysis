" During the fourth inning of yesterday ' s White Sox Yankees contest , Mr Guillen ' s mind conjured a series of insensitive , wildly inappropriate I would even go so far as to say depraved thoughts and images , " said Bob Watson , MLB vice president of on field discipline . " Baseball is a social institution with a responsibility to espouse proper values , and there is absolutely no excuse for anyone to entertain thoughts which portray people in a negative or demeaning light , regardless of their race , color , creed , culture , sexual orientation , gender , weight , or personal beliefs .
