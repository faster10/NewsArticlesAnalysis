With the passengers on board oblivious to the death defying stunt they had just participated in , the passenger in seat 16D was attempting his own abominable act . Darren Lambourne was a window cleaner from Ruislip . He had become radicalised after watching Aladdin on a day when he had been rained off work , and travelled to Afghanistan for terror training . After learning how to make small amounts of liquid highly explosive , Lambourne packed the bottle he thought contained his deadly mix in to his suitcase . Disasterously for the would be bomber and due to the usual last minute rush as you leave for an airport , he left his house having mistakenly picked up a bottle of his favourite aftershave instead , thwarting his heinous plan to bring down the airliner . A lucky escape for all on board then , although this was of no consequence to Lambourne ' s brother who later suffered catastrophic injuries whilst spraying himself with what he thought was Paco Rabanne .
