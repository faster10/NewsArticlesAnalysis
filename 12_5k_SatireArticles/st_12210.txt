According to " Tony " the locker room attendant , a retired olive oil purveyor from Union City , NJ , " the President was really taken by the course and the facility . He thought it would be great if it became the next venue for the Masters , and a future Winter Olympics and said he would be ' talkin to a few people ' , although the President sheepishly said he would prefer to ' drive ' rather than ' fly ' there for his golf outings .
