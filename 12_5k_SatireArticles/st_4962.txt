" This is a truly magnificent night I just wish Gen . Norman Schwarzkopf were here to see it , " said retired Gen . Raymond T . Odierno during a portion of the evening ' s ceremonies that paid tribute to all the commanders of U . S . forces in Iraq over the years . " Twenty five years ago , I was only a major , still in my 30s , and I really looked up to that guy . I never thought I ' d get a chance to do what he did , but a couple decades later , there I was , ordering some of the very same bombing runs that he had . I modeled my entire career after his and feel privileged to have followed so closely in his footsteps . "
