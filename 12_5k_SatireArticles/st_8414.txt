The " Bachelor " stars left the booth with 5 : 45 remaining in the second quarter , an exodus that created a seat for Philadelphia native Will Smith , who joined the telecast moments later . The Oscar nominated actor bounced his son Jaden on his lap as he spent the balance of the first half promoting his upcoming movie , " The Pursuit of Happyness . " Smith was originally slated to join the booth in the third quarter , but a rescheduled flight to Miami forced the " Ali " star to leave the game at halftime , said Monday Night Football producer Jay Rothman .
