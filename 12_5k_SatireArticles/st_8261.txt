" After I landed in Ukraine , it was a seven hour boring flight , I was rudely awoken by her indoors . She asked me if she could have the Lilo as I had been lying there , in the pool for seven hours , I informed my real wife that I would be able to hand back the lilo when I arrived back from the imaginary Ukraine . I was shocked to be told again by the imaginary Roy Hodgeson , that I was not wanted . He didn ' t know anything about a letter . "
