" So here ' s our plan . First through a viral campaign we make people believe that when they are watching television they are not living a real life . We sell to them the idea that by getting rid of TV they can magically improve their relationships and use their liberated hours time to learn stuff that will enrich their lives . We convince them that the only way they can live a real life is by killing off their television sets . " said Danja Wussileave , who heads the marketing department of the company .
