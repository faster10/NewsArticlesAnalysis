" As a kid growing up , the sandwich makers at Quiznos were my idols , " said Coleman , adding that once he began delivering their mail , he handled thousands of fan letters addressed to the franchise ' s sub makers . " So when I started working here , I did everything I could to be near them and just learn , you know ? I ' d purposely push my mail cart slowly behind the counter during the lunch rush so I could hear them take sandwich orders and watch how much oil and vinegar they ' d put on the Classic Italian . "
