The organizer said a group of concerned animal rights activist groups , " growing tired of throwing fake blood and shouting profanities at older women wearing leather or fur coats , " decided to protest the annual motorcycle club event " in a hope to show them our outrage at their wanton use of leather in their clothing and motor bike seats . " " In fact , " said the organizer . " Motorcycle gangs are one of the biggest abusers of wearing leather , and we decided it was high time that we let them know that we disagree with them using it . . . Ergo , they should stop . "
