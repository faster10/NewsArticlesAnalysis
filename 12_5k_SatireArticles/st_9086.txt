One survivor of the onslaught said later in a statement released through the police that , " If you even caught his eye , he would toss a grenade your way without a second thought . We were completely terrorised . Will this be in the newspaper ? Ooh splendid . Can I say Hi to my mum ? What ? ? Oh sorry , I ' m just not used to this . It ' s scary enough if you know what the terrorist wants , but it ' s something else if there ' s no rhyme or reason to their cause . He didn ' t seem to want anything , just another maniac with an appetite for destruction "
