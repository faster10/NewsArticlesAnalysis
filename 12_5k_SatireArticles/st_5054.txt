There are so many guns in that movie , I bet it has more guns than any other movie . When that guy is bleeding in the back of the car , it ' s like , damn , I know what it ' s like to be shot in the gut . But he ' s a cop a totally bad ass cop . When the other cops follow him and make a comment about how crazy Mr Orange is for going undercover , it ' s like Tarantino is making fun of police officers in a really sophisticated way .
