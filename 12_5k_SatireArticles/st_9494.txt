Campaign strategists say it ' s a surprising fact about politics that people to a great degree vote for candidates on gut feelings that often have as much to do with the candidates ' looks as their positions . " It ' s not that looks overwhelm positions , but it reinforces either positive or negative feelings we have about a person " says Ray Culverstone , a political strategist who has worked on dozens of local , state , and federal races , most recently the losing 2012 presidential bid of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney . " You start with the candidate ' s positions : do we fundamentally agree with one another ? If the answer is yes , how strongly you support the candidate is tied in part to whether the candidate looks the part . When you have candidates with more or less the same views , personal style becomes very important . "
