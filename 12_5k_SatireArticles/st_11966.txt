Baez has rejected Halloween , Thanksgiving , and Christmas , as starting date for the trial . He has been insistent that the trial cannot begin before next summer . By his claims he has to read 20 , 000 pages to prepare . This is almost as dangerous as submerging 20 , 000 leagues under the sea . Or playing in one league , the NFL , under the terrifying Roger Goodell . So Baez held his ground during the hearing yesterday . And after a long sidebar , where they had time for a couple of martinis , he came away from the judge with a Valentine to give to his client .
