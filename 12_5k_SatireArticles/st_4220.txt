Bird flu was first identified as a strain of infectious influenza in Italy in the early 1900s . Of the 15 subtypes , only subtypes H5 and H7 are known to be capable of crossing the species barrier from birds to humans . The first human outbreak , which occurred in Hong Kong in 1997 , killed four people . Since then , the bird flu has remained a relatively minor virus , killing fewer individuals than common cold variants . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued neither an epidemic warning nor a public health alert in connection with bird flu .
