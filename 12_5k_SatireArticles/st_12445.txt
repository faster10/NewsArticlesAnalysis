It has been a pain in the butt so far . Now I just have to figure out how to delete all these stupid " apps " this thing has got . I don ' t need the games and the stock market and the compass and the GPS and all of that other garbage . It isn ' t telling me the weather in the city of 100 , 000 people that I live in , but the weather for a suburb of 500 people that ' s ten miles north of here . I also don ' t want the app that takes me to a place where I can get more apps . A phone should just be a phone ( and I should have been born 100 years ago ) .
