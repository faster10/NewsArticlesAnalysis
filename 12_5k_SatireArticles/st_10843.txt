According to Gobbles , the plan was devised in January and in February the tainted ground meats began rolling off the trucks into supermarkets of the unsuspecting humans . Mr Gobbles stated to the associated press that they initially had their friends , the Black Spanish Turkeys , known for their calm disposition distract the humans by making friends with them . Soon , our friends the Eastern Wild Turkeys began to fly like crazy in the pens to cause a mass confusion and that ' s when the Blue Slates , the turkeys who are not eaten but instead are exhibition birds , began to paraded around the meat packing plant and walking all over the unwrapped meat . The Royal Palm Turkeys kept a watchful eye to forewarn the Slates if anyone was to enter the plant .
