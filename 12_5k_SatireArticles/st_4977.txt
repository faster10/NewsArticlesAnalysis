According to family sources , Thompson ' s relationship with God began 14 years ago , when the then alcoholic businessman was born again into the First Evangelical Free Church of Christ . After he entered into a pact with Jesus to renounce sin and , in turn , receive salvation , Thompson ' s bond with God grew so intimate that he couldn ' t help but share it with his family , his friends , people who sat next to him on airplanes , and strangers he met on the street .
