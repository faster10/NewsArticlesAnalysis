The only exception to the " no car " law is limousines , which will continue to be allowed to carry the rich and famous to their desired destinations . Hollywood liberals support this exception . One 14 year old multi millionaire female Hollywood film star , Ima Bratt , said , " We shouldn ' t have to sit in traffic , in our chauffer driven limousines , for hours . We are important people and have important places to go and important people to see . We are movie stars and we don ' t want to sit in traffic ! " Of course , at 14 , she also can ' t drive yet .
