Dennis and Diane met in 1995 at a " Choose Love " weekend retreat , a Reclamation Ministries sponsored program designed to help convert homosexuals to lives of decency and morality . The two grow teary eyed recounting the story of their first meeting , recalling how a group of Christians held them in their arms and prayed to God to take away their natural sexual desires . They are nostalgic as they recall their wedding day , and how , with the help and support of their Christian brothers and sisters , they were able to convince themselves that a life of heterosexuality was for the best .
