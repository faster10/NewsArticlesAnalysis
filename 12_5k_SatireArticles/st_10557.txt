" I mean , female reporters getting to go into men ' s locker rooms to ' get the story ' . I mean , come on . This is while we ' re complaining about men " objectifying women . " Then we get to have Playgirl magazine . And no one gets the joke . I thought the jig was up when Gloria Steinem got married . Remember " a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicylce ? Then she marries . Doesn ' t anyone get irony anymore ?
