" I want to bring a new approach to the Wonder Woman adventures . Maybe something a little more ' in the now ' . " explained Whedon . " I ' m still working out the details , but maybe Ben , or whoever we choose , doesn ' t have to look like a woman . Maybe Wonder Woman was really a woman trapped in a man ' s body . Maybe Wonder Woman is a gorgeous six foot transvestite . All I know is we have a ways to go on the script . "
