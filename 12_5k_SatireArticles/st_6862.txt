" I used to have to think about every concert ticket or restaurant meal I bought , but now that I have a salary , I can do whatever I want , " said Anderton , who puts nearly all of his 500 entertainment budget into savings each month . " If I don ' t have time to cook , which I never do , I just order Chinese . I got an awesome flat screen TV for my bedroom , so a lot of times I just sit on my bed or at my desk and eat while I watch television . "
