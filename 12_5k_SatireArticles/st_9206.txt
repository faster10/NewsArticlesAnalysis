Jack went on to say " Debbie had just captured her first political position when we decided to " recruit " her . It was a seat in Florida ' s congress . We knew early on that we had a winner when she gained so much media glory for her attention to minor liberal weenie causes like swimming pool safety and Save the Manatee campaign . That last one was my idea , by the way . In any case , our mole on the inside of the Florida Democrat party continued to give her guidance on how to manipulate the political process , and particular , the DNC . Before long . she was playing own her party like a fiddle , completely unaware that her mentor was working for us . By 2006 , Debbie got appointed to the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee . This is the point at which we felt her own ambition and obnoxious behaviors would continue to elevate her in the Democrat party without much further assistance . Our mole began to withdraw . "
