According to Mac Richardson , the driver of one of the bulldozers , the rose put up very little fight . " I really wasn ' t sure if I had gone over it or not , " Richardson said . " I just couldn ' t feel its delicate petals and stem underneath an earth moving 14 ton dozer . It wasn ' t until I saw the flower ' s limp , lifeless body ground into the cement behind me that I knew I hit it good . "
