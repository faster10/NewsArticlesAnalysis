The questions do not end with the crash . The loss of John John has left us with a host of what ifs to ponder . One can only wonder what might have been , had he lived : Would his George magazine , which folded several months ago , have survived slightly longer than it did without its leader ? Some believe it was poised to hang on another year or two . Would he have been photographed rollerblading shirtless in Central Park ? Likely , though he hinted at a shift toward shirtless frisbee throwing . Would he have gone on to make more allusions to the possibility of maybe one day running for public office ? He showed signs . Tragically , we will never know for certain .
