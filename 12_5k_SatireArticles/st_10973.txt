" But the blessed Lisa Prettysweet is sacrificing her physical beauty , something which is obviously real . And she won ' t ever get it back . Thanks to philosophy , all she ' ll be left with is knowledge of life ' s absurdity . Fat lot of good that will do her when her face is all wrinkled and her breasts are saggy ! Turning your back on heaven to help out some conquered desert tribe is all very moral . But throwing away the chance to earn millions of dollars thanks to your having won the cosmic lottery , with full lips , large eyes , and a flat belly ? That ' s just insane . "
