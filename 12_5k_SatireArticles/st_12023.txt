At a campaign fund raising speech to a local ladies organization , the President reportedly read a line from his teleprompter , followed instructions that told him to " fart now , " and then read the next line before anyone noticed something was wrong . The embarrassment ( and odor ) caused several women to faint , Michelle to almost gag , Malia and Sasha to giggle , and serveral people to laugh openly . The line uttered was : He said " I wasn ' t pulling your leg aobut the whole birth cerificate thing , ( sound of fart ) just like I didn ' t ask you to pull my finger just now . "
