' We employed a measurement approach , following Dunkleheim Frappler , utilising the Rectilinear Tesselations first developed by Frobisher Mittelstinke in 1967 . Merging this approach with a judicious use of the Scattered Cone Sampling methods developed here at Jutland by Professor Convolvulus in his studies of the social behaviours of the barnacle , we divided the subjects into a Subtractional Trellis of Interleaved Quasi Tranches . Then we exposed them to the boring speeches , which were arrayed in a series of Topographically Superdiametric Ablations , following the modus operandi made famous by Horst Fluck of the Trittelheimer Institute .
