Said Scientific Director Hiram Abiff Black leading the research : " This is a very exciting time for us at Monsanto . We have now managed to breed fish that are impervious to many of the contaminants that are now be found in the sea , mercury , cyanide , potassium sulphate and a host of others emitted by irresponsible industries . So , we have modified all the mainstream consumable fish including crustaceans such as lobster , mussels , oysters and so on . We have been prompted to do this by the United Nations Health Committee who are deeply concerned by health issues resulting from contaminated fish . People will be able to eat our fish without having to worry . "
