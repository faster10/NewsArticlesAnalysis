" She ' s a great girl , but it ' s getting to be a bit much , " said Santos from his room adjacent to Richards ' , his close friend since frosh week . " Its like I ' m not even here , you know ? She comes home from class , takes her hair out of that ponytail , drinks the chai tea I made her and sits on my bed in her little shorts and chats for an hour . Then she leaves to hang out with a Jacob . Or a Shawn . "
