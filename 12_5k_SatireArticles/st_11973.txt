I also disagree with yesterdays narrative surrounding my cellphone . I replaced my broken Samsung phone with a new iPhone 6 AFTER my attorneys made it clear to the NFL that my actual phone device would not be subjected to investigation under ANY circumstances . As a member of a union , I was under no obligation to set a new precedent going forward , nor was I made aware at any time during Mr Wells investigation , that failing to subject my cell phone to investigation would result in ANY discipline .
