An year back , a police cop had found him playing on the road astray , adopted him and brought him to the Police station . Where with his fellow cops named him Jackie in consensus , his name was adapted from the name of an Bollywood actor Jackie Shroff who is also very fond of dogs himself . Reportedly , Jackie , the puppy was just a few months old when brought to the police station . The cops taught him tricks and sniffing , eventually they grew fond of Jackie , and then loved him like their own family .
