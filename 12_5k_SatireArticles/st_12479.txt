The president proposes utilizing pedal powered golf carts that seat 20 people , 10 pedaling freeloaders and 10 tax paying passengers who ride for free . The peddlers will be seated in the front of the bus and the passengers in the rear . The NAACP has objected and filed lawsuits with the US Department of Justice ( DOJ ) to have the peddlers sit in the rear of the bus and the passengers sit up front . USDOJ has responded that the peddlers need to see the road by sitting up front !
