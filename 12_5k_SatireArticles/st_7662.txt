Each attempt resulted in more injuries to the coyote . " I couldn ' t understand it . I still don ' t , " said Daisy . " This coyote was obviously very intelligent , but at the same time , one of the dumbest animals I have ever met . I mean , each plan was more intricate than the last . Why didn ' t he just shoot me ? It doesn ' t make any sense . And the items he used : giant rubber bands , rockets , invisible paint , explosives these are large items . The postage alone from ACME must have been in the thousands of dollars . Why didn ' t he just order a pizza and save his money ? Why all the expense and time over a tiny Maltipoo ? And where was Homeland Security in all of this ? They won ' t let me bring 6 ounces of mouthwash on a plane , but they let a friggin ' coyote order rockets and explosives through the mail ? It just doesn ' t add up . "
