Hurley and Fredericks have put off their research on the properties and applications of ferroelectric materials indefinitely , instead choosing to spend the majority of their time " messing around " with the gigantic atom . In the past two days , they have each gotten their picture taken next to an oversize slide of the atom and e mailed it to colleagues around the country , put Humongolium in a particle collider to see it smash other atoms into thousands of smaller particles , and irradiated several of the atoms to give them a " goofy green glow .
