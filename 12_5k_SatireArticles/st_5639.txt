" The proud nation of Tajikistan is sad to say it was once an Amway distributor , " Tajikistan president Emomali Rahmonov said . " After the collapse of the Soviet Union , all the other republics seemed to be doing so much better than us . Amway waved a golden carrot in front of us , and we reached out for it . But after two years , we found ourselves in debt to Amway . Our sponsor , Roger , just kept on telling us that we had to try harder . But the harder we tried , the deeper in debt we got . And being an Amway distributor certainly didn ' t help our relations with our neighbors : It ' s hard to form alliances when countries are afraid you ' re going to try to sell them Est e Lauder knockoffs .
