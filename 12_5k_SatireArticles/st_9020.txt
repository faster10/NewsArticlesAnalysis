" Could I beat Ali ? " Hatton stated . " I could probably give him a run for his money these days , because he ' s not a well man . But I wouldn ' t have messed with him in the 60 ' s and 70 ' s when he was in his heyday . He fought Ken Norton with a broken jaw , he fought Joe Frazier so hard that his hips got swollen and that ' s usually something that only happens in a high speed road traffic accident . He completely bucked the odds when he beat George Foreman in Zaire , in the rumble in the jungle . The man is my absolute and utter sporting hero . "
