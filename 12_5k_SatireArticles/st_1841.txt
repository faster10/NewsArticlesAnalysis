" Hey , if you don ' t need anything built but have some stuff you want painted or sanded or fireproofed or something , we could do that instead , " said the mayor , his voice steadily rising as he strained to maintain a wide smile . " We could also just put stuff in boxes . We don ' t care . Or just give us the green light , and we ' ll knock down whatever buildings you need and put in those big wind turbines . Everybody needs energy these days , no question about that . Or maybe we could make the whole city into one big 140 square mile organic farm . Those seem pretty popular , right ? Is that what you want ? Fine by me just tell us and it ' s done . "
