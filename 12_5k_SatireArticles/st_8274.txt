David Geffen was cagey about rumours that Arista Records are set to release a Greatest Hits album of Taylor ' s finest innings since 1975 to celebrate his International call up . ' It ' s great news ' , said the grizzled music executive , ' But are there enough members at Notts and James ' former county , Leicester to give us the sales we need to justify the project ? ' , he wondered . ' We ' d need James ' fans on the top section of the Radcliffe Road stand to help with the promotion . Although I ' m just not sure how much tweeting they actually do up there during a normal day of LVCC cricket . Could they make news of the album go viral ? ' .
