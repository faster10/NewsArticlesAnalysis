" We were really excited by the Economic Bubble , " said Ms Pandbread . " This is similar to the Dot Com Bubble of the nineties , but is for the entire world , instead of Sacremento . Apparently , many very nice countries that I ' ve been on holiday to , like Spain and Greece , have seen their economic bubbles go pop . We ' d have placed it number one in the Top of the Pop ' s chart , if it wasn ' t for the amount of misery the popping caused . Where as , as usual , Bubble Wrap does the opposite , and spreads calm and contentedness as it ' s popped . "
