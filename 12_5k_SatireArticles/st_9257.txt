While the TSA disapproves of the new legislation , clearly something must be done to allay the concerns over recent TSA encounters with children , the elderly , and the handicapped . The poster child of the bill introduced by Mr Guilder is a little boy nicknamed " Miracle Max . " The boy ' s real name is Billy Joe Jim Bob Crystal . The miracle is that Miracle Max was born with six fingers on his right hand and he survived a harrowing ordeal when his father was murdered in 2009 . On October 31 , 2011 , the boy was interrogated and allegedly " tortured " for upwards of 6 hours by TSA screeners . The boy ' s crime ? He was wearing a t shirt proclaiming he was the " Dread Pirate Roberts , " along with a complete outfit of a cutlass , a knife , some shrieking eels , and a patch over his left eye . All of these accessories were made out of thin , cheap plastic . According to Vizzini Rugen , the boy ' s grandfather who was escorting him to his plane , Miracle Max cried during the entire ordeal . It was only when the TSA pressed him the 50th time that the boy finally submitted to the security screening . The boy ' s words to the screener were reportedly , " As you wish , " as he handed over his plastic cutlass , knife , and several eels . There are conflicting reports as to what Miracle Max was wearing on his face that caused the enhanced TSA screening .
