" Rand Paul ' s tousled hair is not presidential , it ' s not masculine , " says Ronald Friedman , a psychologist at Columbia University who has looked extensively at what people ' s hair styles say about them . " Even worse , Paul uses a styling gel to get his tousled look , so he faces a double hit with voters . Not only do voters see tousled hair as a lack of strength , but his use of gel makes him seem vain . So , it ' s not a good combination . "
