" I know a lot of people saw Hendrick stumble at the end of the race , and I know what they ' re thinking , " Tergat said when asked to recap the marathon ' s final moments . " I ' ve heard the talk . They ' re saying that after two hours of running one five minute mile after another , my opponent had been physically and psychologically worn down to the point where he wasn ' t having as much fun as I was . I don ' t want to hear anyone say that . Hendrick Ramaala has more fun in his little toe than most people do in their whole body . After all , he had enough fun to dominate last year ' s race . I was just lucky today to have really , really enjoyed myself this morning . "
