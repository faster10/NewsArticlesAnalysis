" I ' m here to tell you that we of Uranus have had it up to here at this point the being raised one of its six tentacles to its head antenna with you people of Earth mispronouncing our planet ' s name . It ' s not ' YER in us ' . It ' s ' yer RAY nus ' How hard is that ? Just say ' your anus ' and you ' ll be pronouncing our planet ' s name right . Let ' s practice it : I ' m from ' your anus ' . And tonight I ' ll be going back to ' your anus ' , which is one of the biggest planets . In fact , ' your anus ' is 7 times bigger than the Earth , and you must have been shitting watermelons to make it that big . That last one was a JOKE , people ! Don ' t you get it ? "
