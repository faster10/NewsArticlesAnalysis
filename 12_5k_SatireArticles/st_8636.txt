Theo Walcott , Van Persie , Alex Song are among many others who have left the club in the past 10 years . In fact , players like Carl Jenkinson , Jack Wilshere , Frimpong etc , who were just in their late teens and still learning the nuances of the game then , developed into star players under Arsene Wenger . They also left the club after they realized themselves that they were star players .
