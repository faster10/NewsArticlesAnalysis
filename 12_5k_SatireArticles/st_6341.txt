Known far and wide as " the biggest oil buffoon in Texas , " T . Ludlow Banks earned his unmatched reputation by doing things his way . He pioneered the practice of cutting in as many middlemen as possible . At a time when others were reducing costs , he put employee comfort first , issuing free cigarettes and Zippo lighters to every person working at his refineries , drilling platforms , and filling stations . And , in his most unorthodox move to date , he imported custom built Italian machinery to pump more than 8 , 000 barrels of high grade oil right back into the ground each day .
