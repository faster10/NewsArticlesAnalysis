" Mr Walsh apologises for the trouble he has caused by his actions last night , however he insists the entire incident was an accident . Mr Walsh was simply using the nails and gas found in the car to construct a fence and supply his shed on his allotment with gas power . He nipped into London city centre to buy the Prada Nails and Gucci Calor Gas his lifestyle can afford , when he accidentally spilled his cup of bovril onto his lap and smashed the car into the wall of the club . Mr Walsh apologises unreservedly for his actions after the incident and realises he should have stayed at the scene of the crime to alert authorities . "
