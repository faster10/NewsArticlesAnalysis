" It ' s long been documented , whether consciously or not , that scent plays an important part in a human ' s development of any relationship . Our primal instincts , our olfactory equipment , is still there from our earliest ancestors . We have just masked our inherent sense of smell , with perfumes and deodorants , which ironically advertise your appeal , when if fact they hide it , smother it . Man could and can distinguish his family , food , and his mate by scent , " said Sniffme Corp spokesman Frank Snuse .
