Ed Billingsworth , of Forrest City N . C . said " Not since a 1974 locally released film called Closed for the Winter had it been this bad . Back then it was a summer release so we thought people would understand , but I ' ll be damned if they weren ' t so dumb they thought the drive in was closed . Now I feel like the idiot for letting history repeat itself . I ' m out of the movie house business for good this time . Home and truck are paid off kids and grand kids are fine so now I ' m gonna retire and do some renovatin ' in my own life " .
