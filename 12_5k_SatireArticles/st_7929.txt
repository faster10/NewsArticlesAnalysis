" Jor El went home and began constructing a special teleportation device designed to transmit solid matter across great galactic distances . It was Jor El ' s hope that with enough time and research , he could adapt the device so that it could relocate all of Krypton ' s major population centers to a surrogate home world far away . Without the Science Council ' s support however , his work proceeded slowly and he was unable to perfect the device to his desired specifications . He succeeded in completing a prototype model , but it was only capable of transmitting small volumes of material . As the time of Krypton ' s imminent destruction grew near , Jor El knew that it would be impossible to perfect the teleporter in time to save the populace . However , he was able to save his son . Jor El placed baby Kal El inside the teleporter and transmitted his atoms across galaxies where the baby rematerialized safely on a world known as Earth . "
