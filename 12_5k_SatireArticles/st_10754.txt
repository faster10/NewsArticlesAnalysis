Basso isn ' t the only one with cause to be down . Jan Ulrich , the cycling world ' s perennial second banana , has stood one down on the podium five times since winning the tour in 1997 . " Oh I ' m good , make no mistake , " boasted Ulrich as he showed reporters calf muscles the size of Christmas hams . " But that guy ' s resting heart rate is like 34 freaking beats a minute .

" Added Ulrich , " To hell with this , there ' s a little place I know in Montmartre where Jan always wins , if you dig what I mean "
