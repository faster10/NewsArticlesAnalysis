" Everyone at Rubio ' 16 is very grateful for Marco ' s hard work these past 10 months , but we think someone with a fresh , new approach will give us the best shot at winning the Republican nomination and taking the White House in November , " said campaign manager Terry Sullivan , adding that while Rubio would no longer be a part of the campaign going forward , the rest of the organization would remain in place , exactly as is . " This campaign is a well oiled machine with a terrific network of volunteers and staffers across the country , and with a little bit of new energy in a key position , we ' re confident our message will appeal to all Americans .
