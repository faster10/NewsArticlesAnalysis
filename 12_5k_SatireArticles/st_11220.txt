This program is delivering on an extremely hard agenda of the security of all Australians and we get little thanks . In fact some fringe groups ( BTW we know what your talking about ) were in fact UnAustralian in their obstinate refusal to expose every detail of their lives to our data harvesting dragnet . Now that parliament had passed the keep your data forever and give it to whoever we feel like legislation it was now illegal for any Australian to hide any personal details from the government , with the risk of 10 years in prison .
