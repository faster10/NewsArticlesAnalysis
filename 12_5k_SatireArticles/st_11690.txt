I know what you ' re all thinking : Agnes , you ' re off your rocker . Duck ponds are supposed to have ducks ! Well , that may be true , but the Miller Park pond just has far too many . They ' re there when you sit on the bench , when you go for a stroll by the gazebo , and they even follow you into the parking lot . Everywhere I turn , ducks are there . Judging you . It ' s gotten so a lady can ' t warm her bones in the afternoon sun without being surrounded by ducks .
