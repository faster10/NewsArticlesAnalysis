Billy Smith , a Chelsea casual in the 80s , said : ' Kids now , they just don ' t know what it was like then . We wasn ' t just battling the French and the Kraut fans , we had to take on the cops too and we still beat ' em all , right across Europe ! ' Another hero , Jim Braithwaite from Sheffield , also said : ' Once we were in the Continent we were unstoppable ! France , Belgium , Holland , Sweden , there was hardly a jail in Western Europe without a few of our comrades banged up for the weekend , before getting the slap on the wrist of a deportation order ! Great days , great times . '
