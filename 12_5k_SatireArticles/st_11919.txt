Jack , a 30 year old city councillor in nearby Martensville and a small consultancy business owner , went on to say he had nothing but the second best expectations for his son . " I can ' t wait until I enroll him in hockey , " he explained with a beaming smile while holding his boy . " I ' ll get to watch him and constantly be reminded how much better I was when I was that age . All the parents will say wow , look at how good that kid is ! He must be Jack ' s son . " '
