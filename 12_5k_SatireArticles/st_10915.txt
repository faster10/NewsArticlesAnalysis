' So then bein ' a picture framer I starts t ' work out ' ow many smaller paintings ol ' Pablo coulda turned it into so ' s t ' make ' em easier t ' flog . So I ' m standin ' there makin ' these square shapes in front ov me wiv me ' ands tryin ' t ' work out the amount of pictures yer could get and the cost ov puttin ' ' em inter decent frames . That ' s when Alfonso taps me on me shoulder curious t ' know why I ' m makin ' these square shapes wiv me ' ands . ' Good morning Sir , ' he says , ' Ex cuse me for interruptin you . My name is Alfonso and I ' m a dirsctor of this museum ' he says , ' and I just happened to notice you making lots of little square shapes with your hands . It ' s just that I ' ve never seen anyone doing that before when admiring one of our paintings . Would you be kind enough to explain why you do that ? ' .
