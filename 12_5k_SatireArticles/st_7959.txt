" Obviously , the peg wasn ' t square , " said Tested . " It was a cuboid . And the hole wasn ' t round , it was cylindrical . A square is a two dimensional shape , and holes should be , by their nature , three dimensional , making them cylinders . Actually putting an actual square peg in an actual round hole merely involves rolling the peg into a cylindrical shape and sliding it right on in . Putting a cuboid peg into a cylinder is vastly more complicated and a better use of our time . "
