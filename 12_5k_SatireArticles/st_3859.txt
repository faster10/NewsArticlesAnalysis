" Sure , some people cheer and wave signs , but it all seems so mechanical , like they ' re just going through the motions , " Romney said . " Have you ever seen anyone at a Mitt Romney rally with tears streaming down their face ? No , of course not . Has anyone ever spontaneously started a spirited ' Mitt , Mitt , Mitt ' chant that I could spend a solid minute basking in before finally beginning my speech ? No way . In fact , it ' s hard to even imagine it . Why is that ? What am I doing wrong ? I mean , I say inspirational stuff , don ' t I ? "
