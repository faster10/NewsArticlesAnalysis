As explained by Shaw , the security guard should be given an Ipad that has the name of customers and the color of cars for each customer ' s parking space , so he can check on suspicious cars . The security guard can be alerted to any car that enters the motel parking lot that didn ' t pay for a room . Each key should have a large green card and customers should be told to walk around with their guest holding the key so the security guard can see that they are customers .
