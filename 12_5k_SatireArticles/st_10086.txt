Professor Peter Condum of The College of Sacred Limb Wisdom Seminary in Broken Glass , GA , takes a rather dim view of what he calls " the lesser sex . " He points out in the creation myth in the Book of Genesis , the evil snake goes to Eve to tempt her into giving Adam the apple from the tree of the fruit of knowledge . " The wise snake knew that the silly , over sexed , vile weakling Eve would succumb to the snake , not to the stronger , manly Adam .
