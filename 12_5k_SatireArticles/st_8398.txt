For the sake of Nick Boynton ' s physical and emotional health , let ' s wish him well and hope he ' s on the road of recovery and will trudge the path towards a healthier lifestyle . It ' s evident Boynton has much to offer to the world of hockey , since he already made the grade as a standout . There ' s nobody better to add color to a game than a longtime veteran like Boynton . As innumerable others who ' ve used A D treatment to get the law off their backs , though , Boynton ' s sobriety and wellness game is a real longshot . So if you see him staggering around a casino , reeking like the backdoor of a saloon , and yelling and screaming at an Autotote ticket puncher , tell him to go home before he bites somebody with a badge and a gun . And an anger and attitude even worse than his . . . .
