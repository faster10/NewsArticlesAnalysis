For these students , a new rental package is being offered by Le Mons , the luxurious downtown housing facility built last year to accommodate the rising number of upper crust students in attendance at the University ( following the recent toughening of admissions standards at east coast schools ) . Students are able to special order such services as standing pools of urine , random sporadic gun re , frozen corpses on their doorsteps , and the new Infest O MagicTM process , which brings authentic Manhattan style cockroaches directly into the customer ' s home .
