When quizzed about his " Irish " accent in Angels and Demons , McGregor could only answer , " I was mucking about . I thought I was going to reloop the dialogue later . " Upon spying the interviewer ' s incredulous face , McGregor blurted , " Honestly ! I can do an Irish accent . Listen ! " McGregor then proceeded to regale the interviewer with an accent later described as being worse than Tom Cruise ' s in Far and Away incidentally also directed by Ron Howard , perhaps suggesting that Howard has no idea at all what Irish people actually sound like .
