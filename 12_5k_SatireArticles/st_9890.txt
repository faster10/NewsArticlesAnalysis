Bentlyville ( AP ) Who says Bentleyville isn ' t a tourist destination ? The population of the small town has swelled dramatically since news of a local barkeep ' s bizarre discovery swept through the sleepy community , and far beyond . " I was just staring at the Nativity scene in front of the Rufus County court house , " said Herb Rosenhauer , " when I noticed something unusual . If I stood at a certain angle and in a certain light and looked at the Virgin Mary blow mold , I could distinctly see a slice of toast appear on her robes . I think its Pumpernickel . "
