The Zimbabwe despot hailed Bin Laden as " a shining example to us all in the pursuit of democracy . " George Galloway responded to the news by saying " he will no doubt leave an enormous hole in his wake , " whilst holier than thou Irish songster Bono used more colloquial English referring to the fugitive leader as " simply a wicked bloke ! " George W Bush was unavailable for comment . A White House spokesman said an official comment would be made later , adding that the President was " jumping up and down " and " throwing his toys around " at the news .
