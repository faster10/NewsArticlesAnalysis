Mrs Queen did not , as many expected , throw Mr Williams into the tower , " I could no more do that , than eat one of my corgis . Besides , we ' ve tried it before with she who ' s name we cannot say , you know the one , ' so thick but so thin ' , and it didn ' t work then and won ' t work now . And unlike her , Mr Williams plays a good hand of bridge and always brings a bottle of Gin which never fails to bring back nice memories of our dear departed Queen Mummy . However , I will be warning him to keep his beardy gob shut in future . "
