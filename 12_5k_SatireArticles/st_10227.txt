" We have a very successful line of life size dolls and action figures . We contracted with Frankenstein , Inc to bring one of our life size Ken dolls to life . After years of failures , we were able to create the actual live , anatomically correct version . At this point , the joint venture ran into problems with the creature having no mental faculties . We then brought Microsoft in to develop a software program to run the cybernetic brain we had developed . The results were amazing , as witnessed by his quick rise to power . "
