" We always say that one football team ' wins ' the Super Bowl and one football team ' loses ' it , but when you think about it really think about it outside the narrow framework of scoring points is that an accurate assessment of what happens ? " Wheeling , WV resident Matthew Holland said . " One team celebrates while another walks solemnly back into the tunnel , but why ? Another football season will begin again soon , and in the fullness of time , another Super Bowl will be played as if nothing had happened . And in a way , nothing has . "
