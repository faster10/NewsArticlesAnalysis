Sally ( 22 ) and Tony ( 24 ) have been renting a comb for 18 months . " It will be so nice to have a comb of our own , " said Sally . " Mum and Dad have been nagging us for years to buy one . The one we ' ve chosen is a bit more expensive than we can afford , but Mum and Dad are helping us with the deposit , because they are getting fed up with us borrowing their holiday comb every weekend .
