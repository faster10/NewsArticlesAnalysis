While Cheney is known by many to be cold and taciturn for the other 11 months of the year , those close to the vice president say there is something about the 9 11 season that puts a smile on his face and a spring in his step . Each Sept . 11 morning since 2001 , Cheney has come to work donning a fireman costume and handed out small , thoughtful gifts to all White House staffers . In addition , at his home on 9 11 Eve , Cheney lays out large piles of presents for his children and grandchildren underneath the colorfully lit , six foot tall 9 11 towers that he sets up by the fireplace .
