" It is truly a blessing to start a new life in a place of such unbounded prosperity and plenty , " said 43 year old migr Bart Willard , adding that in his American homeland he had once been a construction worker but , like many of his shipmates , had gone years without work . " There was nothing left for us in the old country . Few trades were available to honest workers , most of us couldn ' t afford our own dwellings , and our lives were plagued by routine deadly violence . That ' s no way for anyone to live . "
