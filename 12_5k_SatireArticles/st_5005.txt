The collapse occurred approximately 40 minutes into the song " You Enjoy Myself , " when the four band members Mike Gordon , Trey Anastasio , Johnathan Fishman and Page McConnell became overwhelmed by a combination of body odor , marijuana and the patchouli oil many Phish fans use in lieu of bathing . The foursome was rushed to the emergency room of Denver Lutheran Hospital , where they were partially revived by emergency oxygen treatment . As of press time , the musicians are still listed in critical condition .
