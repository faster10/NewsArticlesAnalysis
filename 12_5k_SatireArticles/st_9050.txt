" After the baby was born the Doctor took it straight away , which was scary . A few minutes later he came back and told me that he had some good news and some bad news . I asked for the bad news , wanting to get the worst over , and he told me the baby was little ginger girl . I was devastated , but he quickly told me the good news , she had died shortly after birth . I can ' t tell you my relief . "
