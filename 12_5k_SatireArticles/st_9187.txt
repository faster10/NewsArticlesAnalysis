Washington DC : President Obama has just signed America ' s new prohibition bill into law . This law is similar to the 1920s and 1930s alcohol prohibition that restricted and set down the rules for enforcing the ban on alcohol , as well as defining the types of alcoholic beverages that were prohibited . The interesting part is that this law doesn ' t give the federal government the authority to restrict alcohol consumption , but instead it puts a ban on the production , distribution , and consumption of sugar and products containing sugar . This means that any and all products that is currently on the shelf at your local grocery store that contains Sucrose ( sugar ) in any form will no longer be available after December 31 , 2012 .
