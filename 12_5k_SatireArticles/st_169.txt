" It was sometime around the beginning of summer , after the end of the school year , probably May or June , " Belbol said . " It was definitely ' 92 , because Chris and Steve O were there , and they graduated a year before me . Plus , I remember that Achtung Baby , which I think came out in late ' 91 , was still pretty new at the time , and we were playing it non stop . But whenever it was , we were nuts to have gone up there , especially considering how drunk off our asses we were by the time those cops passed by and told us to get down . "
