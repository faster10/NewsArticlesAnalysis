Turnbee ' s dissatisfaction also extended to the layout of the food court . Accustomed to the Buffalo Road restaurant ' s bright dining area with vaulted ceiling , sturdy booths , and a fully stocked napkin , condiment , and straw counter , Turnbee was dismayed by the food court ' s long lines and ill defined , drafty space . Forced to walk far from the Taco Bell kiosk to the other side of the packed food court , he said he was displeased by the narrow width of his table and found his chair to be rickety and unstable . Huge potted palm trees placed throughout the food court blocked Turnbee ' s vision and gave him a vaguely claustrophobic feeling .
