" People think they know me because of how I ' ve been portrayed in the media , but it ' s really misunderstood how much people don ' t understand how misunderstood I am . I ' m a professional athlete , I don ' t have to adhere to the same standards as a regular person because I excel at something that allows inferior people to live vicariously through my success . Remember last year when I made that really big play that won that super important game ? Of course you do . Why ? Because it ' s extremely important to a substantial part of the population . It ' s obvious why I should be granted some leeway when it comes to obeying the law , I led my team to victory in the most important game we will ever play until next year ' s most important game to ever be played " said the increasingly famous athlete .
