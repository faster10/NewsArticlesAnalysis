" I ' m too ' in my head ' right now , you know ? I have to remember my training from when I was a pup and just be natural , " said the dog , adding that despite his most recent failures , he believes he was born for this . " No more stopping in the middle of a run to find a private place to go to the bathroom . Why would I even do that ? I know I ' m running in the Iditarod , for crying out loud . And I ' m certainly not going to sprint into my teammates ever again , because that means I ' m destroying our neck and tug lines , and I ' m going completely the wrong way . "
