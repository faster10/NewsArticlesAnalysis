Mr Reid continued , " If Walmart gives financial relief to the victims , that will only embolden workers to demand safer working conditions in Bangladeshi factories . If we have to provide fire escapes , see to it that factory exits aren ' t blocked , factory buildings aren ' t going to collapse , that people have access to toilets and that sort of thing , the cost will just be passed onto the American consumer . Look , American shoppers don ' t care if exploited children , working 14 hours a day , make their clothes in unspeakable conditions in sweatshops . Bargain hunters at our stores just want low price and Walmart is there to meet their needs . "
