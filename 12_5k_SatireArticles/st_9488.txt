My first thought was that reporter Inskeep is just one of thousands in the Corporate Media who have been neutered by their bosses . I simply imagined that he was one of this nice looking guys with a TV future , who didn ' t want to offend anyone , and so walked both sides of the political street . " He wants to be another David Gregory , " I mused . But further contemplation revealed that Mr Inskeep ' s statement was so outrageously stupid , that there must be something seriously wrong with him . It turned out that I was right .
