After some delightful fish and chips and a fresh Guava Rubicon , the interview got underway . We first asked him why he was at a cricket match in the West Indies . He replied , " I have always had a love for cricket , ever since I was a young boy all those thousands of years ago ! I particularly like the Indian team , even though they have brought all their second team players to this tour . I watched every game that India played when in the World Cup , like the England group game , boy wasn ' t that a cracker ! "
