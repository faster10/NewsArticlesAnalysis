Large crowds gathered at the Civic Hall for the Flatulence Competition , which saw Russian Boris Wringsting going for his third gold in the event . Officials had been hoping to stage the event outdoors , for obvious reasons , but due to the start of the football season both Ibrox and Parkhead were unavailable . Spectators were asked to wear suitable clothing for the event , and officials made sure all doors and windows were left open for the duration of the contest . In an exciting , and loud , competition the Brits were successful with Billy O ' Docherty taking the gold with a blast of 77 . 08 decibels , beating the defending champion Wringsting , who took silver with a parp of 76 . 99 decibels . Antoine LePetomaine of France took the bronze , but was later disqualified after judges noticed that he had " followed through " .
