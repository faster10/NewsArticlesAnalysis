Everyone knew Nelson Muntz , the famous bully from the Simpsons with his equally famous catchphrase , " HA ha ! ! " was trying to get his character changed . He succeeded , but not in the way he wanted . Nelson has been fired from the show and his character ' s spot as head bully will be filled by a new actor , " Qiuck " Harvey Brown . Brown begins taping episodes later this month . Nelson ' s disappearance will not even be mentioned on the show , he simply will no longer be there .
