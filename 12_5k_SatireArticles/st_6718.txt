" I once heard Davrian say that Bonkers will get lonely without a human voice around to make him feel reassured , " Franz said . " But the thing just sits in the window and watches birds all day , just the way it did before she left , and just the way it ' ll keep on doing after she gets back , every day until one of the two of them dies . Meantime , the damn radio yabbers on all day and night . That radio ' s probably more aware that the woman ' s gone than Bonkers . "
