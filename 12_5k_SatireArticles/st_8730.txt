DI Lineker continued , " The bus was stationary in a lay by having been brought to a halt by the poorly driver . He could then be seen slumped in his seat apparently unconscious . Mr Cataract wandered to the front of the bus with his finger up his nose and scratching his backside , rifled through the drivers pockets , manoeuvred him onto the luggage rack before starting the engine and driving off into a semi detached house about half a mile further down the carriageway , narrowly avoiding a completely traffic free road . Conveniently for Mr Cataract there were no other passengers so he must ' ve seen an opportunity to rob the stricken driver before concocting his cock and bull story about saving the bus and fellow travellers from disaster . As for his claim that he narrowly avoided mowing down some schoolchildren , well , hardly likely seeing as it was 8 . 30 in the evening when all of this happened . "
