" Look , we are patriots . . . . " said Cheney . " We all have some excellent management experience , and thought it our duty to come to Washington and offer our services to make government run more efficiently . We had already made billions of dollars for the oil industry . Why would we need to make any more money ? We were concerned about all of the terrorists , and wanted to do something about it . With so many terrorists in the world , we simply don ' t have time to think about the oil , anymore . "
