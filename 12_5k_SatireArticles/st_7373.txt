Politician Edwina Currie , who could hear the rowing going on from her boudoir , thought she could defuse the situation with her debating skills and entered the party in her negligee . ' Let ' s all calm down ' she said . ' Foggy state your case ' she shouted . As she tried to find a resolution , Edwina spoilt it by making reference to Jimmy acting too ' wimpy ' and pulled a rat from her handbag which she wiped across his face making him squirm . An appalled Kendra Wilkinson yelled at Edwina ' take your heartless piece of ass outta this conversation ' . As the fight kicked off second round , a shocked Edwina was said to have shit herself and had to be kindly escorted back to her room by Joe Swash who was seen holding his nose behind her . She hadn ' t been very well in the last day , she reportedly crapped herself on the I ' m a Celebrity coach !
