" Our primary concern with the Car of Yesterday was safety , " said NASCAR competition director Robin Pemberton . " The fans hate that shit . We had to keep that in mind when we went back to the drawing board , so we took away anything that increased grip , improved handling , or prevented a stock car from experiencing a sudden and total loss of control . NASCAR isn ' t about the cars , it ' s about the drivers . And the Car of Yesterday keeps the driver involved with the vehicle , whether he ' s just driving it or , ideally , crashing it . "
