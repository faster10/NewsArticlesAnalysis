The Trans Texas Corridor would have included stretches of highways and toll roads that would have run parallel to Interstate Highway 35 , but would have by passed Dallas Fort Worth , Austin , and San Antonio and would have just gone straight to the Mexican border . " It would have been great , " stated Stephen Fortwright of Denton , Texas . " Every day I commute from Denton to downtown Fort Worth for work . I spend over an hour and a half in traffic , and the vast majority of vehicles on the road are trucks . "
