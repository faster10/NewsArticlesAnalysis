Tom Travesty , an American Evangelical Christian , criticizes the spirituality of Potlandians . " We ' re supposed to be religious , not spiritual , " he says . " Only perfect beings like Jesus and the angels are fit to be spiritual . We ' re fallen creatures , so we ' re supposed to be colossal hypocrites . That ' s why when I can be bothered to read a passage from the Bible , I make sure to do the exact opposite of what it says . The more I care only about my narrow minded happiness on Earth and let everything else go to hell , the more likely God will look down at his Creation and say to himself , ' Well now , what I ' ve wrought has been so thoroughly corrupted that I ' d better get off my high horse , put all my spiritual perfection to work , and clean up that mess . '
