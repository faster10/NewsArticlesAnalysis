LANCASTER COUNTY , Pennsylvania ( ABSNN ) A vast number of the farms in this Pennsylvania county have no electricity , no televisions , no telephones , no motor vehicles , no Honey Boo Boo . They are Amish folk , and yet , even the Amish know of the Twilight Vampire Series . However , one Lancaster County farmer , a man named James Pattinson , a non Amish land owner , has never heard of the Twilight Saga , even though he is a first cousin to Rob Pattinson , a major star in the Twilight firmament .
