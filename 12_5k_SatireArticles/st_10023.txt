After hearing about Maria Fillippo ' s experience with the Donald Trump Jack in The Box , we reached out to other parents in the area who have had similar experiences with the so called " greatest American toy ever ! " . Janet Monistat , mother of four couldn ' t have been more caught off guard . " I came home , taking pride in an American made toy all wrapped up for my son ' s birthday . He unwrapped it and started playing with it . Then all of a sudden , every time it popped open , he would hand my son a playboy and tell him which bathroom he should be using . It was ridiculous . "
