Some life forms in the ocean coexist in a symbiotic relationship . Symbiosis is a primitive type of evolutionary coexistence . The state of coexistence in lower life forms leads to a higher form of coexistence between advanced life forms . For example , a school of fish led to wolf packs which then led to the relationship between pet dogs and humans . The relationship between dolphins and humans is not symbiotic , but it ' s a form of admiration which is a form of coexistence a bit more advanced than symbiosis .
