" Well , " said the Head of Barrels and Transportation of Fuels at Dutch Shell , " Most of our barrels are made from high grade aluminium steel alloys . These are darned expensive , you know . We re use , of course , but , nobody recycles . And every day we get more and more oil , and a shrinking amount of barrels . So , then we have to produce the barrels , even more and more . The cost of oil isn ' t going up at all it ' s the cost of barrels . Supply and demand , really . "
