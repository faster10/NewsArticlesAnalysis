Many finishing moves have been invented , the most popular being catching a cleaver in your teeth ( whilst the remaining are caught by hand ) . Another well known finishing move to the trick involves catching all the cleavers behind your back . One artist , who goes by the nickname ' Bubba No Fingers ' , has his own finishing move which involves juggling with 10 cleavers and letting them all fall on to his fingers as a finishing move . He has only performed this move once .
