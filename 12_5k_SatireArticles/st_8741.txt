Maria Gibson , a spokeswoman for Diabetes UK , described the comments as " very insensitive " . She said : " Inbreeding is a very controversial word and has implications of incest . . . Clearly genes do play a factor because you are more likely to get dia betes as a child if your parents have it . another controversial word is controversial , there is always a controversy whenever this word is mentioned " But we still don ' t fully understand the relationship between genetics and diabetes and there is ongoing research into it . " The fact that there has been a big increase in recent years suggests that genes actually might have less to do with it . We suspect that a mixture of genetics , environmental factors and infections all play a part . " Ms Gibson said that the number of type 1 diabetes cases among children aged under 15 in the UK had risen from 11 , 400 in 1996 to 20 , 000 in 2004 . Type 1 diabetes , also known as insulin dependent diabetes , is commonly found in children , while the type 2 condition generally occurs in older people and is often caused by fattiness .
