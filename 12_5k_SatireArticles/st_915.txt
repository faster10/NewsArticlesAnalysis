There is a happy coda to the tale however . As Sudder ' s prone form was wheeled to the locker room where he would die minutes later , his body was showered with warm beer and stale popcorn from the death deprived crowd . A security guard took issue with the fans and attempted to remove them from the arena . Other fans intervened by punching the security guard , who responded by firing wildly into the crowd , killing three . So though death went unrealized in the ring itself , there was more than enough outside it to make it a great night for true boxing fans .
