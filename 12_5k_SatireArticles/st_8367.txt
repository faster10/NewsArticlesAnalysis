Snyder filed a 1 million defamation lawsuit against the Washington City Paper in the spring of 2011 , making him look like the nasty creep to the home crowd that he ' s always appeared to be in Indian land . And ironically , this racist , this Snyder guy , had the unmitigated gall of claiming that an etching on the cover of the Washington City Paper was a racial slam to Jewish people . WHAT ? ? ? ! ! ! . Danny Boy , the Washington City Paper cover is not lampooning your " Jewishness , " this much is obvious they ' re parodying you for being Satan himself . It ' s not a depiction of a Jewish guy with those horns growing out of your picture and the evil looking mustache and goatee .
