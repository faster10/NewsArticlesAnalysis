Hispanic leaders were despondent at the news . " Man , we can ' t catch a break " said one immigration reform activist . " All those years of dropping millions anchor babies , just when we think we ' re ready to jump on the gravy train , it turns out to be the orient express ! Those Chinee ain ' t gonna put up with that bullshit ! They won ' t even let their own people have babies ! Working in the kitchen of a Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles is one thing , but I ' ll go back to selling tortillas on the streets of Mexico City before I work in a Chinese factory or coal mine along side the Chinese prisoners . . . it ' s not safe !
