The good news is that sparsely populated Alaska will have another resident in four months . The really supper good news is that John Edwards is not the father . Whew . Palin ' s daughter and boyfriend plan to marry after the child is born and will not be guests on the Maury Povich show . Judging from Governor Palin ' s mother in law ' s statement about still voting for Barack Obama , the whole gang might make it to the Jerry Springer show instead . Did Clara Harris , ( she who ran over here husband five times with her Mercedes Benz ) have a mother in law issue ?
