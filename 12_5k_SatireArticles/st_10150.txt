Detractors have charged that the governor is simply catering to the wealthy on the deal , primarily as a means of making Paris Hilton ' s time in jail more comfortable . Schwarzenegger has a different explanation : " I ' m not stupid . If I were going to cater to the rich , I wouldn ' t do it right out in the open . I didn ' t get to be governor by showing videos of me and my good friend Willie Nelson smoking pot . Paris Hilton lived in mansions all her life , so putting her in one of the little cells for normal felons would be cruel and unusual punishment . I ' m sure the next thing I hear will be that I did Rick a special favor because of his big campaign contributions . My record shows I don ' t give in to anybody . I did this for California . "
