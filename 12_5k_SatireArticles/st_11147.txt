While introducing the legislation , the Minister for Public Affairs , Mr Joh Bull , claimed that the consumption of so much alcohol will be beneficial to society and to everyone . He said that there will be much less violence and crime because everyone will be so drunk that they won ' t be able to stand up and fight or commit crimes . There will be no more dangerous driving or road accidents because no one will be able to stand up long enough to get into , let alone drive , a car .
