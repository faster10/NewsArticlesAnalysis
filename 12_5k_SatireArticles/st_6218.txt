This case marks the first challenge against the stopping in the name of love doctrine first established more than 40 years ago by the Supremes Court , the nation ' s highest judicial trio , which presides over the federal government ' s Motown branch . The Supremes Court has set numerous anti heartbreak precedents since that time , including the 1964 overturning of Georgia ' s breaking up laws in favor of more lenient kissing making up statutes , and a 1966 decision that deemed unconstitutional the practice of hurrying love , which was determined to be in direct violation of what the court ' s mama said .
