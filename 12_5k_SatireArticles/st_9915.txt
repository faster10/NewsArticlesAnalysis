Trump ended his speech with a humble proposal that he be appointed Messiah in place of Jesus . " I know plenty of Jews . I dine with some of the world ' s most prominent Jews . I used to know Malcolm Forbes well . Wasn ' t he a Jew ? I dunno . And Warren Buffet . I don ' t know if he ' s Jewish , but he ' s definitely rich . And you know what ? They all like me better than Jesus . That ' s why I ' d like to offer myself as King of the Jews . "
