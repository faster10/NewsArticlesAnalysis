We caught up with Dr Felix Sweetspot , PHD in swing construction , who first brought the problem up to Mickelson . " I first noticed it was a problem at the Bay Hill tourny in Orlando back in March . On one particular hole , I think it was on Friday morning , Phil five putted for a double bogey . Worse still , he tipped his cap after each and every putt . Plus , there was almost no one in the gallery ! I thought to myself : ' Uh oh , Mickelson ' s addicted to hat tipping . ' "
