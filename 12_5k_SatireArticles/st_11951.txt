" When we first shook hands he electrocuted me with one of those hand zappers , " Mullerbeck remembers . " Then he introduced himself as Indiana Jones . I didn ' t know what to make of it . He wasn ' t very professional . I tried to discuss putting a contract in place but he didn ' t seem interested at all . He just kept talking about his athlete ' s foot . I decided I ' d had enough nonsense after he invited me to an orgy . Call me old fashioned , but that ' s not the way I do business . "
