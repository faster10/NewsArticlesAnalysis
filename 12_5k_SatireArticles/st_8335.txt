Already trailing by double figures in the second half , Wade stepped to the line for what he called two " critical " free throws . After clanking the first one off the back iron , Wade was seen shaking his wrist and then glaring at official Ken Mauer . As he saw his second free throw falling off the rim , Wade wildly flailed both of his arms and jerked his head back as though he ' d been shot , leading to a heated discussion with referee Scott Foster .
