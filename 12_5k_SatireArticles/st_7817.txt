As Mr Chaser put it : " If Charlie Sheen had been at the office when he needed that ambulance , this would be a clear case of an on the job injury . However , since the injury took place outside the workplace while Charlie Sheen was doing research related to his work , the case is less cut and dried . A successful claim will turn based upon convincing the judge that this research was a factor in Mr Sheen ' s employment contract even though he was not specifically compensated for such actions . "
