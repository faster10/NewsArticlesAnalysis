You see even though we offered the part to three other actors that you know about and six others that you don ' t know about yet but that we ' ll deny when you do hear about them , the fact is that it doesn ' t really mean that we offered them the part of James Bond that we did in fact offer them because we only made those offers because we couldn ' t find Daniel Craig ' s phone number for 18 months and so because of that those offers don ' t really count if you really think about it so because of that anyone can really see that even though we made offers to other people really in truth the fact is that it could be said that maybe if you look at it a certain way like we do after many drinks and obscure rationalizations we only ever really offered the part to Daniel Craig because we wouldn ' t have offered it to the people that we did offer it to that we now deny offering it to if we hadn ' t had to offer it to them because we couldn ' t find the first person we had hoped to offer it to and then did end up offering it to , " said Wilson .
