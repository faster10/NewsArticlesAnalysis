Rove reportedly tried to prepare Bush for this inevitability in late July by taking him on a special fishing trip so they could spend some quality time together and he could also give Bush a brief rundown on how the presidency works . Rove said he " didn ' t have the heart " to break the news to the president , who fell asleep in their rowboat with the fishing pole still in his hands . On his last day , nearly two weeks later , Rove spent the whole morning with Bush before the tear jerking exit , ruffling his hair , telling him to " be brave " and " listen to Cheney , " and explaining that he was going to have to be " the man of the White House now .
