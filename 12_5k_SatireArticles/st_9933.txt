Over 100 witnesses testified at the trial making it very easy for the jury to decide Mr Tillims fate in the 20 minutes they took to deliberate . The pilot stated " I began to hear screams from the cabin . Then Melissa banging on the cockpit door . I could smell a faint scent coming from under the door . The screams coming from the cabin was unbearable . Melissa was screaming she couldn ' t breathe , just let her get some air . But I knew if I opened the door we would all perish . It was the hardest decision I have ever had to make . "
