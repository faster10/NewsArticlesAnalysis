In a highly synchronized early morning battlefield maneuver , M . E . N . D . combatants , in collaboration with patriotic SSS and National Intelligence Agency ( NIA ) operatives sympathetic to General Jomo Gbomo , took General Olusegun Obasanjo , Alhaji Atiku Abubakar , and all the service chiefs , in a lightening move , into protective custody at an off shore platform , just after midnight of Sunday , 22 April 2007 , for over 5 hours . It was considered a complete waste of time and resources to bother about Generals Ibrahim Babangida , Aliyu Gussau , Theophilus Danjuma , Muhammadu Buhari , Abdulsalami Abubakar , and David Mark , as bugged telephone conversations revealed that they were all about to flee , or have already fled Nigeria anyway , and any organized opposition from any one of them would probably have been a monumental failure , knowing how very much Nigerians despise them .
