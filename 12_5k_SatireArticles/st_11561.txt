Ms Haruka Shindo created her perfect man and called him Akirasan who had the face of a fish , the body of a sumo and the legs of an ostrich . He was never late . He never spoke back . He could cook and clean . He put the seat up when taking a slash and always cleaned around the toilet bowl . He made his wife breakfast in the morning and drove her to work . He put the lid off the Colgate back on the toothpaste after he had cleaned his teeth . He could speak perfect English and say ' You ' re right dear , I am so sorry , ' without appearing to be the least bit insincere . He was tidy and also did his ironing and also did the washing up and the drying up . He was CEO of a successful family in Mafia wars with a network of 2323 members and an empire stretching from Italy to Cuba to Brazil and Las Vegas . He was also a successful farmer and had a huge farm on Farmville . Akira was big in the virtual universe and was obviously going places . Have you ever met a man like this ? No and that ' s why he looks like a fish .
