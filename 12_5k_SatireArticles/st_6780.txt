Continued Elizabeth : " I could not bear to see George ' s youthful dreams wither and die as mine had so long ago . I have always hated my ambitious , swaggering husband , who thinks himself one of the chief men of town despite his many failures , but it was always an impersonal hatred , because he was only a small part of a far larger problem . But now he was this thing personified . So incensed was I that I grabbed a cheap Swiss Army knife from the impulse purchase rack flanking my register , and with great determination strode to the breakroom , intending to stab my husband . When I killed him , something would snap inside myself and I would die , too . It would have been a great release for all of us . "
