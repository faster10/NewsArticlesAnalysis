( AP ) Winnie the Pooh , that silly old bear , announced at a news conference in Toon Town that he is gay . The revelation , of course , drew no astonishment from those in attendance . The surprise , however , was reserved for the revelation of his lover when he outed fellow Disney alumni Mickey Mouse . Said Pooh , " Oh bother . I was tired of living a lie . First the three witches from Sleeping Beauty came out , then Tweety Bird , and now it is our turn . "
