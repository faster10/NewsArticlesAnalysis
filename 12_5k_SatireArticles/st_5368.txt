" Given the media ' s clear preference for thin physiques , we expected most Americans would be actively seeking to emulate such body types , but we found that nearly 7 in 10 American adults possess the inner courage and determination to overcome the constant pressure to maintain a trim figure , " said behavioral psychologist and the report ' s co author Olivia Trumbull , noting that these Americans boldly ignored , on average , 10 to 14 images of in shape individuals every minute of the day . " This level of resolve is astonishing , considering that the media is saturated with models , actors , athletes , and pop stars who are no bigger than a women ' s size 4 or a men ' s large . However , if you look around any American town or city , you ' ll find incredibly brave women who are size 18 , size 20 , even size 24 , as well as brave men who routinely wear XXXL clothing . That ' s a testament to American willpower . "
