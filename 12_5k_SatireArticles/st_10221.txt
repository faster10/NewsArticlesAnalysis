" We ' ve also come to realize that we can achieve even further savings by rolling back our employment practices in general . Another great thing the Bush administration has done is to make is next to impossible for an employee to sue his or her employer , therefore it is no longer in our best interest to spend untold sums of money on employee safety and ergonomics programs as a preventative measure to ward off costly litigation . The great thing about the business climate now is that we can literally work our employees to death , pay them next to nothing , not be liable for any of the medical expenses they incur , and simply replace them with warm bodies when they are no longer useful to us . As such , we can now start rolling back our internal safety and working condition regulations to eliminate mandatory bathroom , lunch and other breaks , we no longer need to invest in safety redundancies or to have unskilled employees supervised when performing dangerous tasks , we can now require 3 consecutive 24 hours shifts without paying overtime and no one will question it , and we anticipate if this trend continues , within a couple years we ' ll be able to bullwhip any employees who are not performing up to our standards .
