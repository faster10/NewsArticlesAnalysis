" It ' s nothing personal , " said Santa , whose age could not be determined . " I ' m actually doing them a favor . You see , by giving out candy to the good kids and coal to the bad ones , they get a little taste of what to expect at Christmas . And if little Jimmy is upset with his Halloween coal , he has some time to change his behavior . Who knows , maybe if he stops picking on his sister and starts cleaning his room , he ' ll be able to get that new video game he ' s been bugging his parents for ? "
