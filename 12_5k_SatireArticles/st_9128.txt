When the baby ' s parents unwrapped that teddy bear and placed it in his crib , the bear waited until midnight , and then came to life . The baby ' s cries woke his parents . They sat bolt upright , and then rushed into his bedroom . They switched on the light , and were horrified : their baby had scratch marks all over him . Mrs Smith asked her husband , " Do you think the cat did this ? " He replied , " No . I locked Snickers in the bathroom . Besides , that ' s just an old wife ' s tale . I ' ll look again , just to be sure . "
