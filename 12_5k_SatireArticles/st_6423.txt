" When it comes to being a father , if something distracts you from putting your baby even the screams of the curled up baby itself you have to have the patience to step away , take a deep breath , grip the club , and go through your pre changing routine until the moment is right . I wasn ' t going to putt Sam until she was completely silent . "
