This has not happened by accident . It is the result of difficult decisions and of patiently working through our long term economic plan . Above all , it is the product of back room gamesmanship , in which every one of Freemason Lodges , every Fleet Street subservient and every television network has played its loyal part . The successful concealment of Jimmy Savile ' s misdemeanours for over fifty years and similar cases gives clear evidence , does it not ? , of the efficiency of our system of Sheeple management . Transparency is what this government is about , after all . The public ' s interests must always and irrevocably come first and without a Police Force answerable only to the people this would not be possible . We must be grateful for that .
