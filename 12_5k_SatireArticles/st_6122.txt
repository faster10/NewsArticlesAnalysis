In a survey conducted by entertainment industry analytics firm Rentrak , moviegoers cited cost as the main reason for avoiding the theater , noting that the price for a family of four attending the Pixar hit Inside Out in theaters could reach 50 , compared with the 12 . 95 it would cost to run off four copies of the script at a nearby print and copy center . Taking 20 children to the same movie for a birthday party would cost as much as 200 , excluding soda and snacks , compared to the much lower cost of letting the children act it out in a parent ' s basement or rec room .
