" It ' s incredibly frustrating to try to talk some sense into someone who doesn ' t realize that Crimea ' s very freedom as an independent nation is at stake , " said completely ignorant San Jose , CA resident Carol Goldmacher , who admitted that she has clashed constantly in the past week over Ukraine with her staunchly apathetic roommate Lisa Suarez . " Talking to her is like talking to a brick wall . It ' s almost as if she doesn ' t even want to hear how Putin was kicked out of Ukraine by his own people and then retaliated by invading Crimea . Frankly , no matter how much I tell her that Obama ' s this close to breaking his silence and issuing a warning to Russia , it ' s just not getting through to her . "
