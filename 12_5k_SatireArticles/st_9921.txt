Trump was rumored to have asked : " Can ' t the guy understand English ? So Canadians say hooose and we say house . Tomato , tomato , potato , potato , they ' re good people up there , but they don ' t speak our language . If immigrants don ' t learn our language , they can ' t assimilate into American society . But even if they do learn the language , immigrants can ' t run for President . They ' re immigrants ! Maybe Cruz should run for Prime Minister of Canada . Ship him back to Saskatchewan or wherever he came from . So he has anchor children . So what ? "
