Mitt Romney quickly pointed out to people that he has had illegal Mexican maids for many years in his family , and that he can even say a few words to them . He fondly remembered conversations with these " women from other countries , who I tried to come to know and understant . " His examples of getting to know them better included things like " llavar mis ropas , por favor " and " donde esta mis zapatos ? ( translated as " please wash my clothes " and " where are my shoes , " respectively ) .
