The implications of the findings don ' t end there . The late anthropologist Dennis Rongalley posited a theory in the 1950 ' s suggesting dolphins played an indirect part in human evolution . ' ' The Gorilla and Chimpanzee were once confined to beaches , but the sarcastic nature of dolphins drove them inland , and that ' s when their development and diversity really took hold . It was a Cambrian esque moment for bi pedals , ' ' he says in a 1954 article . Mr Rongalley died in 1957 after his theory was ridiculed for being ' dangerous and stupid . ' His funding was cut and he eventually died of starvation .
