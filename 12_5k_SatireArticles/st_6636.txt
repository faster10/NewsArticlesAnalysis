" I can focus on doing my own thing now , and I can finally stop worrying about whether or not the British are going to like my work , " said Gary Sherwin , a post doctoral bioinformatics researcher at Stanford . " From now on , I ' m working for me and my colleagues , and if England doesn ' t like it , it ' s their loss . Of course , it ' d be nice if , when they see what I ' m doing , they ' re impressed , but I ' m not holding my breath anymore . "
