Daisy continued , " As if that wasn ' t enough , 20 minutes later , I come across a pile of kibble in the road , with a sign that says ' Free Dog Food . ' So I eat some if it to regain my strength . Out of nowhere , this pissed off coyote comes up to me , and instead of snatching me again , he looks at the kibble all angry like and starts to eat it too . Then his stomach explodes . It was insane . I was relieved though . I thought for sure my ordeal was finally over . No one can survive an exploding stomach . "
