Leskanic , a right handed set up man acquired by the Red Sox halfway through the 2004 season , pitched nearly 28 innings for the team from July to September , and was present as Boston defeated the Yankees in the ALCS and went on the win the World Series . However , as legend has it , the Red Sox refused to offer him a contract extension , despite the fact that he was coming off a 3 5 season with a 5 . 19 ERA and 37 strikeouts . Leskanic , unable to find work in the major leagues , retired and the rest is history . Since then , the Florida Little League team that Leskanic went on to coach has enjoyed unprecedented success , winning the Lake County Round Robin two years in a row and going undefeated in 2006 .
