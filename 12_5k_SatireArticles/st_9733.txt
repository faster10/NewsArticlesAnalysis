" And so we speak with authority on the comfort and safety of the vehicle we wouldn ' t think of exposing others to what we ourselves would seek to avoid . " Young later clarified his statements , admitting that his caucus didn ' t actually get inserted into the pipeline , but traveled in an open air capsule simulator down the length of the corridor in the east wing of the Capitol . " Even so , " said the congressman , " it was fun , kinda like a bobsled run . "
