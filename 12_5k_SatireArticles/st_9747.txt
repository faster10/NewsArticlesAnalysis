Secretary Burwell outlined four phases to the relocation plan : " The Anti vaxxer children and their guardians will just be the first stage of the plan . We can ' t allow any immunocompromised people to remain in the USA because they still might come into contact with a person who ' s shedding live virus , get sick , and pass it to another person . So everyone else who can ' t get immunized , like cancer patients , patients on Humira , and so forth , will be relocated , along with their guardians if they ' re underage . Phase 3 will be all the other conscientious objectors , like Jehovah ' s Witnesses , Christian Scientists , and the Amish if they refuse to get immunized . We ' ve seen how their foreign missionaries get infected and bring disease back to the USA with them . Phase 4 will be all remaining adults who refuse to stay up to date on their booster shots , or who can no longer get booster shots . Part of our plan includes the expansion of Memuruland into Idaho , Utah , and Wyoming if necessary to accommodate these people . But we really don ' t expect their life expectancy to be as high as ours or their infant mortality as low , so this provision probably won ' t be necessary . "
