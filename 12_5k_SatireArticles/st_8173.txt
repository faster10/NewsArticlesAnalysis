Yes , as hard as it may be us to believe , it ' s finally true . It ' s a dream come true to all of us who have the uncontrollable desire to eat and can ' t stop ourselves once the frenzy begins . Now we can eat any and all and as much of the many delicious delights as we like and fear not that it will all go to waist or hips or thighs . Cravers can run amok ! No fasting required EVER ! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it !
