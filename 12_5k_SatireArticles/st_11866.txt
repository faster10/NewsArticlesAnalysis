Man , I could be doing so many other things right now . I could be hanging out with friends , carousing , enjoying the outdoors . I could be doing stuff I actually like . But no . Instead of being allowed to have fun like other guys my age , I have to spend hours of my time each day writing down the symmetric momentum flux stress energy tensor within local spacetime curvature . And for what ? So I can put my name on some idiotic paper ?
