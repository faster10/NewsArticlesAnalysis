AFC Hades will have a number of players at their disposal , including the late George Best . Best would have liked to have turned out for Heaven United , however years of alcohol abuse and womanising has meant that he was eternally banished to the seventh circle of hell . Best said yesterday " Although Heaven United was obviously my first choice , I am an AFC Hades player now and will be giving my all in this match . It will be good to catch up with some old friends " .
