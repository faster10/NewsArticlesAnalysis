When it comes to fashion , I ' m always ahead of my time , but honestly , I feel like the Gods , or some higher fashion power is stopping me from taking the credit I deserve . Red pants have been in style for a good two seasons now , starting with the casual spring collections , which is , like , fine , except for the fact that I ' ve been wearing red pants since 2008 and no one was appreciating it as usual , and then all of a sudden I ' m riding on my boyfriend ' s motorcycle and a drunk driver sideswipes us and kills him and , like , totally obliterates my legs .
