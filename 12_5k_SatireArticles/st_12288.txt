A representative from the Missouri Department of Education said that " of course males are going to look at skantily clad females , regardless of their age . You often can ' t tell how old they are until you get up close . Saying that teenage females cannot wear bikinis to car washes because they might turn on a pedophile is the same as saying that they can ' t wear bikinis to the pool or the beach because they might turn on pedophiles . These perverts just don ' t want to accept responsibility for their actions and are just blaming the victims again . "
