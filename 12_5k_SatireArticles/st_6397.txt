Berman further theorized that these conflicting definitions muddy the idea that there can be a clear cut Super Bowl winner , stating , " After much thought , I am left with the question : What if both teams are succeeding by striving ? And what if both teams actually have conflicting concepts of what constitutes their opposition not a mere football team , but an adversary physical , metaphysical , or perhaps even emotional ? If we agree that this is the case , then each team may have its own unique definition of success independent of the other , a definition rendering any so called ' final ' score moot . "
