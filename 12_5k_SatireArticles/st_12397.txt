In an article on a website earlier this week ( Meridian Magazine ) , a woman proposed a situation : your 15 year old son is on a camping trip and sleeping in a two person tent . Wouldn ' t you rather have him in that tent with a fifteen year old gay scout instead of fifteen year old girl ? Her thought was that the gay scout would not be likely to come onto another boy on a campout , where as a male and female in a tent could not come to any good .
