Though no formal charges have yet been filed against Zollner , police have collected substantial evidence against him . For example , contrary to Zollner ' s claim of being " a major music lover , " a police search of his home found that he owns only six CDs , one of which is a Little River Band disc still in its plastic shrink wrap . Further , Zollner ' s assertion that he loves " drinking wine by the fireplace " was cast into doubt when investigators found no trace of either wine or a fireplace in his three room apartment .
