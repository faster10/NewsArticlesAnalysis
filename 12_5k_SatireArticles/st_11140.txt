We played as kids together , were taught by the same Scribes , later hung around the same taverns , got arrested for throwing stones at the Roman soldiers . We were close as only real men can get close . As for Jesus , suddenly he ' s there and I ' m unemployed . . . so . . . to hell with it . . . I take whatever ' s offered don ' t I ? You have to live in the real world , don ' t you ?
