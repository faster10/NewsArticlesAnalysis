" What we ' re trying to say is that no one should eat any part of any endangered species , even if it is just an animal , because , ultimately , who really cares about animals , anyway ? " said associate director of public relations Jessica Musgrove , who quickly added that she does care about animals , just not the ones that taste great , after which she reportedly mumbled " damn it " under her breath . " Cheetah shins are also delicious . Of course , this is also something I shouldn ' t have said in my official capacity , so please just forget I said anything about cheetah shins . But as long as we ' re on the topic , my God , cheetah shins paired with giraffe neck in a balsamic reduction ? You absolutely have to try it . "
