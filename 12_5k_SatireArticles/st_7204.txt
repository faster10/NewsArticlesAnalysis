An official spokesman for Popeye ' s , when asked about the same issue , said " most people don ' t associate Popeye and Olive Oyl with human breasts when they think of chicken breasts . I suppose they are also upset because we market our product as being " hot spicy . " Besides , why are they going after the chicken on the bone guys ? They don ' t seem to be going after the burger boys with their chicken strips , chicken tenders , or chicken nuggets . Can ' t they also be derogatory terms ? Did N . O . W . buy stock in the boneless business ? Why are they going after the restaurants and not the grocery stores and meat markets ? "
