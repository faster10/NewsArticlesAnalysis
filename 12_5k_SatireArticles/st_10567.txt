" Well now , you must be from Fox News , " said a rankled President , " but let me explain just for you since all the other reporters gathered here clearly ' get it ' . I ' created ' these jobs as ' new green jobs ' when I instituted a new color rule and altered our prior counting methods . And I ' saved ' these jobs because all these corporations followed my new rules rather than go out of business and fire all their employees . So , really , I ' created ' 100 Million jobs and ' saved ' 100 Million jobs for a total of 200 Million . I ' m just using the most conservative number I can think of to describe what occured . "
