" I was just nearing the bottom of the run when I spotted it from the corner of my eye . . . a tunnel with steps under the snow . The sun was in my eyes , but there was no mistake . Of course , I stopped immediately . I had never noticed this thing before because it is not a side of the mountain I like to visit . The steps led to a steel door that had a big triangle emblazoned on it and a huge eye in the centre . Above it , the words " The Bank of Atlantis " . I tried to open the door but an alarm went off and I quickly got out of there . You bet ! "
