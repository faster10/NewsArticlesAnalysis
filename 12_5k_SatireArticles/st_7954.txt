Kell apparently has denied responsibility for this security risk which is clearly a result of short sited design work . Power supplies should not be something that can be damaged by a virus . In fact , no hardware of any kind should ever be possible to damage via software . Sure , you can " brick " a motherboard by messing with the BIOS , but even this isn ' t permanent if you have the right equipment to re write the BIOS . Kell has left thousands of businesses and schools open to terrorism or acts of revenge by angry people . Kell does not appear to be doing anything to solve the issue once and for all . There is simply no excuse for this .
