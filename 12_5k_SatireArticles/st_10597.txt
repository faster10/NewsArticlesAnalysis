When Ms . Palin was asked why she thought the show was relevant to Discovery Communications , she responded , " The Discovery Channel has long been a problem to true Conservative Christians . After watching a show on the Discovery Channel , my baby girl broke out in tears and begged me to stop shooting her caged pet rabbits with my AK . It has clearly been used as a tool of those whiny environmentalists to break up traditional family values in the home . The Bible says to honor your father and mother , not question them . It was turning our children into tree hugging , pet loving , Socialist Marxist Communist zombies who didn ' t even delight in killing for fun . It was turning our children into flitting faggots . It was obviously the real reason that my daughter got pregnant out of wedlock . My show will teach good , wholesome , traditional Christian values to the network and bring balance to the Godless station .
