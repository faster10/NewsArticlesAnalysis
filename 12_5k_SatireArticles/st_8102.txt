" Call him superman , " said John Cascada one of his colleagues in CER . He was fun to be with , an all rounded man . He can talk jokes , though sometimes corny , dunk basketballs and fall his ass to the ground , sometimes cry over the fate of interstellar galaxial collision , and almost anything that normal human do . The most celebrated though of all his achievement was his development of " Sucking Holes Theory , " giving birth to what is now called " Black Holes . " Since then he devoted his time in NASA thinking about Holes .
