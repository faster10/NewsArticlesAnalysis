Thurmond ' s proposed legislation would establish stiff penalties for the transmission of certain obscene words and phrases along Western Union ' s telegram and telegraph wires , including " merry widow , " " bosom , " and " underthings , " as well as prohibit the use of the word " legs " instead of " limbs " when referring to the female anatomy . In certain contexts , the words " disheveled " and " heaving " would also be regarded as violations of the law , with perpetrators subject to fines of 50 or seven years hard labor on the proposed trans American steam railroad .
