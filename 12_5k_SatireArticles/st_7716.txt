Although Pitt is preaching caution over throwing that same caution to the wind , he is aware how letting once in a lifetime opportunities can go on haunting you for years later . He recalled , " I remember I was an up and coming actor and I had the chance to meet Tom Cruise at the LA premiere of ' Risky Business ' . I spent the whole week rehearsing what I was going to say in front of the mirror ( " Hey Tom ! How are you ? I think you ' re great " ) , but when the big day came , I chickened out . I idolised the guy but when I saw him , arms interlocked with Rebecca Demornay , on the red carpet smiling radiantly to the adoring fans that oh so radiant smile I just froze . At the after show party I couldn ' t even bring myself to eat off the same plate of hor d ' ouevres as Tom , I was so nervous . Instead of biting on vol au vents I was biting on nails . That haunted me for years right up to the time I became a significantly bigger star than Tom . I ' d expect he ' d gets nervous talking to me now ! "
