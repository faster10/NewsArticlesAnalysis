The contents of the tape were of a gnarled New England fisherman , whom investigators of the tape have identified as one Cap ' n Obed Marsh of Innsmouth , MA . Marsh ' s campfire story remains classified at this time , but sources indicate it recounted the tale of a ghostly being who would rise up out of either the oil fields of the Middle East or possibly Texas , dubbed colloquially as the Oil Ugly . Whitehouse insiders say the President remained stoic until the section of the tape where Marsh pointed out that it was " a ' hunred years ta ' the very day " since the ghost last appeared , and then repeated the words " doomed , doomed , doomed " , over and over with his index finger outstretched toward the camera .
