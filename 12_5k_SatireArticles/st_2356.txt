In a commercial recently screened for test groups , a muscular eagle like man , presumably Nisroch , is seen flying over what appears to be an ancient city . The eagle then plummets to the earth and plows through the roof of a building where men in loincloths are working out with modern weight equipment . After drinking an entire bottle of Eagle Heart X TREME WHIRLWIND , Nisroch works out on various machines , pushing himself harder and faster as the X TREME WHIRLWIND formula presumably kicks in .
