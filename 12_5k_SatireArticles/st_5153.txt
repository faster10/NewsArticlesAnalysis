" Hear me , O Britain ! " exclaimed His Royal Highness , whose voice was heard to peal forth from the lists as thunder from great mountain height , ringing in every corner of that green and pleasant land , as well as on BBC Two and internationally on ESPN , garnering a nod of approval from the Queen , who gazed on regally from the royal box . " This man hath proven himself worthy of our mercy . For to fall in joust before the Crown Prince of England the very herald of God on Earth is no shame nor would I call foeman any prince who hath the strength to acknowledge Jesus as his Saviour and to hold inflation to a stunningly low 1 . 3 percent . Therefore I spare his life , and call my noble cousin mere cousin no more , but brother , in hopes our fair nations may find brotherhood indeed . "
