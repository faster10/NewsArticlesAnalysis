The current ACT Labor government has responded to the challenge by introducing a ' trial period ' of ' green ' bins in a few selected areas . The Minister for Local Services said " People who want to use the service will pay 50 for the ' green ' bin . Those people who don ' t want it won ' t have to pay . " She went on to say " Our service is better than the Liberal proposal because we will give residents the choice of whether to use the service or not . "
