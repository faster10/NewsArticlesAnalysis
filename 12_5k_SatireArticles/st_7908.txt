Researchers in the Jutland team used the latest hypertrophic magnetoscoping image technology , isolastic looping polygraphics , the Professor ' s own Architectonic Resilience Shuttle Encephalography , neon lights that flashed inside glass valves , complicated flowcharts with long names , biros , sheets of A4 graphpaper and special Self Reflective Goggles with matching Big Woolly Earmuffs to study the activities of experimental subjects . ' We also employed items such as the ear trumpet and the wax cylinders ' , explained Professor Convolvulus , ' in order to put the subjects at their ease so that they were not distracted by our impressive array of new equipment . When we recently experimented upon the Jutland chickens , they refused the eggs to lay , being frightened by the Oscillating Plasma Resonance Domes we employed to record their social behaviours , and a study last year was ruined when the tapirs chewed the Logarithmic Vectron Platters .
