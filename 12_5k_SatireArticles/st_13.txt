" For decades , these oil wells have suffered untold misery under Saddam Hussein ' s tyrannical rule , " said U . S . Commander General Tommy Franks , speaking from southern Iraq ' s Rumailah oil fields , the site of the liberation . " With this victory , these long oppressed wells will soon pump their first barrels of crude as free and equal wells in the global petroleum marketplace . They will join the ranks of the world ' s liberated oil wells , enjoying the same rights as their democratic brethren around the globe . "
