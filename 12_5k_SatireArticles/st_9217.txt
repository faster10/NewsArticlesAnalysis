Moynihan emphasized , " This is NOT a get rich quick scheme . This is not a program designed to make our customers quick and dirty , nouveau riche it ' s designed to make them affluent . That is , to attain a lifestyle infinitely more tasteful and enduring than plain old ' rich . ' And it ' s certainly not a something for nothing deal you have to put in the time , literally . Because unless you deposit hours into your account , there won ' t be anything to guarantee the securities you own . "
