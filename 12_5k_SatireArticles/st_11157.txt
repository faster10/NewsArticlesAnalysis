Mister Corbyn and his uneducated followers may boo all they like Mister Speaker , but let us all ask ourselves . . . would there have been a Nietzsche , a Wagner , a Bernard Shaw , Fabian Socialism , the doomed Russian experiment , an Adolf Hitler . . . or even a Harry Potter without the theory of evolution and its attendant New World Order goal of the Ubermensch that we all blindly serve ? Or does Mr Corbyn really believe that the recent developments in bio genetics and the genome project are some half assed attempts at finding a cure for acne ? ( Laughter ) .
