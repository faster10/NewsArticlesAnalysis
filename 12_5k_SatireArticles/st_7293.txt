Eric Berne once wrote an excellent book called " Games People Play " . The theme of the book is that people don ' t have relationships , they play games . Relationships demand a dangerous degree of honesty and responsibility , while games allow us to be childish and manipulative . In Hollywood , they use the saying , somewhat sardonically , that " it ' s been real " . When they ' re not pretending to be someone else , then they ' re pretending to be themselves . When the game becomes chronic , they can completely lose touch with reality , and go on a fatal ego trip . Though the game paid off , for awhile , once they ' ve reached the terminal stage , their ill gotten gains are of no use to them , and they begin publicly pulling themselves apart . This is similar to what happened to Nixon , during Watergate ( Dickie was tricked into eating himself ) . A fascinated public then sits back to watch , much like spectators to a train wreck .
