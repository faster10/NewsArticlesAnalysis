The following was released by KFC : " Last year , we had P . E . T . A . mad at us because they didn ' t like the way Tyson , Sanderson Farms , and other meat packing plants killed and prepared the meat . Now these people want us to change the names of our meat . Many years ago , we had to go from the name Kentucky Fried Chicken to KFC just because people didn ' t like the fact that we were fried . Millions of people every day eat our product in homes and restaurants and picnic grounds all around the world and no one else has ever demanded this stupidity . The Colonel is probably rolling over in his grave right now . "
