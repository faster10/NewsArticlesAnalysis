We are delighted to say that the Chilcot Inquiry was tough in its exoneration of our old business partner Tony Blair , . . . wherever he is . The notion that our own Prime Minister was nothing but a tool of Anglo American oil barons and Zionist political power interests in the Far East egged on by a lunatic called George Bush and his madder son and sorcerer ' s apprentice George W . Bush has been finally laid to rest . The two and a half million words report has proved conclusively that nothing could have been further from the truth . I would expect Tony to send a thank you card to his good friend Gordon Brown for selecting the members for the Inquiry .
