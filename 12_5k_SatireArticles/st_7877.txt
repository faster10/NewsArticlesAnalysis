No doubt the new guidelines would implicitly rewrite the rules on obesity . ( Some unscrupulous hucksters , having obtained a pre print of the research , have already begun sending around Nigerian Pharmacy SPAM preying on the gullible , assuaging their guilt over being obese and assuring them they ' re not really fat , per se , they ' ve just picked up too much extra Dark Matter from eating too many Dark Energy dense foods and claiming their miracle pills will help take off the extra mass without resorting to diet , exercise or other pills . )
