" Just because we ' re not a bunch of stiff lipped upper crust snooties doesn ' t mean we can be pushed around , " said Michael O ' Keene , a part time club caddy and self described serious partier . " There was a time when I kissed up to these snobs in the hopes of receiving the club ' s special caddy scholarship . But in the end , I learned I had to be true to my heart . No matter how stuffy and authoritarian the setting , the snobs cannot keep us down . "
