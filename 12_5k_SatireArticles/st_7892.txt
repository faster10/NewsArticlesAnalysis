As part of the bid for Reserve status for Ealing , street lights were disabled within a ten mile radius : from Elstree in the north to Surbiton in the south , and from Uxbridge in the west to Islington in the east . In addition , local byelaws were passed to enforce the use of blackout curtains after dark within the Reserve area . Car headlights and other sources of light , necessary to facilitate travel , were required to be red in order to not affect night vision . ARP ( Astronomy Reserve Protection ) wardens now tour the streets at night to ensure compliance .
