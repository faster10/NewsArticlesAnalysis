Saul : I know Palm . . . just being silly . Anyway , let ' s get on with this . The raging fire surrounding Sydney , Australia may engulf the entire city . Relief helicopters hired from America are on their way . . . but it may be too late . Reasons as to why Australia does not have its own relief copters may be hotly debated in Canberra in the coming weeks , to no effect of course as the Ozzie government is Brit controlled and totally corrupt . Ozzies have been conditioned to love dishonest politicians the way the French and Italians love promiscuous politicians . How good is that Palmela ? We can learn something from Australians . Meanwhile , the George Bush bush fire may take thousands of lives . Britain who claims ownership of Australia refuses to comment . Prince Andrew and Prince Harry who have been stationed in Canberra to help strengthen British hegemony over the Australian continent , have been airlifted out . Reports say none of them have been hurt , thank God . Prince Harry has recently dyed his hair black in a bid to win the affection of the Aboriginal population on behalf of Her Majesty ' s government . The Bush bush fire may be out of control , but what else is new ? Anyway that ' s all for now folks , have a nice day . . . and don ' t listen to a damn word we say ( laughing ) . And now over to Palmela for the latest Stock Market prices .
