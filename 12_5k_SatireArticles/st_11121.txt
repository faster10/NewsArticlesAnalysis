Mr Turnbull told his audience that the number of such immigrants is diluting the Australian people . According to the latest unbiased census there are more extra terrestrials in Australia than the total population of the country .

Their claims that they only want to live in peace , and that the name of their home planet , Zxgte , means ' peace and submission ' have been ridiculed .
