As soon as I found out about the move , I was elated . I have a very finicky circadian rhythm , and doing something so late at night , every single night basically gave me a form of sleep deprivation hallucinations that is very rare in places with a normal daily sunrise sunset schedule . Basically the only people who suffer from it are scientists stationed in Alaska and Al Pacino ' s character from Insomnia . Just to give you an example , I once thought my partner , Alex Reiser , was a terrible shrieking whale bent on my destroying my family . I know now that he ' s not , but that ' s what the old time slot did to me .
