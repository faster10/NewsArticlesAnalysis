And so in conclusion , we should understand that " the media " has now been erroneously conflated with " the press " of Madison ' s day and the First Amendment right of the freedom of the press . It is with great fervor that I write this open letter to the media , informing them to cease their lies . The media in the US has spread the lie that Congress cannot regulate them , cannot abridge its First Amendment right to be free . The media needs to either go back to printing books , pamphlets , and newspapers , or be shown to be the charlatans that they are . There is no freedom of the media only the press is free !
