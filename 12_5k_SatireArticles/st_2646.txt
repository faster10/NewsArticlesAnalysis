In a massive , highly coordinated raid , 50 armed agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives will reportedly storm the home of a randomly selected law abiding gun owner in the dead of night and seize every weapon on the premises . According to sources , the surprise operation has been several months in the planning stages and is being conducted entirely for the sake of watching the individual gun owner and subsequently , the nation ' s gun rights activists as a whole completely freak out over it .
