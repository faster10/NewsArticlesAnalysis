When asked by reporters about the connection between doormats and " Islamic fascism " , the President abruptly snapped , " Nothing " . Further questioning about the meaning of the term " Islamic fascism " as used by the President , and Mr Bush ' s close personal relationship with the Saudi royal family , whose titles include " Keepers of the Holy Places of Islam " elicited the following answer . " I ' m the decider , see . I make decisions , and I make decisions about things like fascism , and I decide who ' s fascist and who ' s not . Just buy one of these mats , this is all I ' m asking you to do . And if you don ' t buy one of these mats , the choice is clear . Do you want to fight the terrorists here , or do you want America to win the war against the evil doers ? "
