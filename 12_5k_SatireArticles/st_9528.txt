Sitting in a bar one night , he recalled , a man approached him . The man sat next to him , and told him how he may be able to help with the current crisis . Obama was only half listening , as he was drowning in a pool of misery , tears , and whisky . The man then opened his coat , and from within its depths he pulled out a branch . " This , " said the man . " Shall protect this nation from the threat of terrorism . " The man promptly left , and Obama was left sitting there with the branch . He looked at it for some time , scepticism filling him . However , he decided to take the branch , in order to protect himself if gypsies were camping on the lawn of the White House .
