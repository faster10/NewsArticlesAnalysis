" Katrina , Rita , the tsunami , the rains in New England , New York and Pennsylvania look at all these disasters . Water is the common element to all these great disasters , " Mr Chertoff announced . Reuters correspondent Norm Al Guy remarked that these were natural disasters . " We have not yet eliminated Al Qaeda and other Islamic Fascists as the cause of these disasters , " Secretary Chertoff responded . " Think about it , these are religious fanatics perhaps they prayed real hard for all those disasters to happen . It is our position that ultimately , the only way we can win this war on terror is by moving away from water . Why do you think they live in the driest parts of the world ? Americans will only be safe in dry climates . "
