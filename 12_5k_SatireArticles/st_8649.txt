Kev Smart , a Dealer in the London area also condemned the move " This is madness , we buy the drug in 9oz blocks , what is the point in dividing a 9oz block into 255 . 15 Grams , that is far too much work , man . " He went on to provide other reasons why he believed the move would not be popular with his customers . " Most of my customers buy , like , a half ounce , they just come in and say , like , ' Can I have a half O ? ' and that just sounds so much better than ' can I have , like , 14 . 175 grams , dude ? ' "
