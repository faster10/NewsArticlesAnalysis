" What we ' re looking at here is a worst case scenario . The initial chip is so embedded in the dip that it can ' t be extricated by conventional means , " said the 28 year old leader of the emergency operation , Jason Larkin , who reportedly was present when the initial chip fractured in two , leaving its lower half helplessly submerged in a composite of salsa , refried beans , and ground beef . " If everything goes as planned , and it ' s a big if at this point , we ' ll be able to make sure both of these chips get out of there okay . "
