It isn ' t as though he was an aging man for whom glittering fame had long since been revealed to be a false and gaudy trinket , a proud individual for whom his own fast approaching and shameful decline would have been too much to bear , or a tired man who had long since been imprisoned by his own notoriety and would have been willing to do anything , anything to regain the freedom of anonymity , right ? I mean , come on !
