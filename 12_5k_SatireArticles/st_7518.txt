In the past , Hollywood types were content to display the heads of elephants , rhinos , giraffes , and hippos from their walls . This was very lucrative for the Bwanas they hired to guide them in their endeavors as well as their porters . Also popular were fish mounts and butterfly collections . Killing animals has become politically incorrect and the focus of Hollywood stars has turned to collecting small children instead . Movie stars have a short attention span and some fear that as interest in these children inevitably wanes that the children will soon be discarded and sent off to be cared by nannies , boarding schools , reformatories , prison , and the armed forces . Some may even go on to become Republicans .
