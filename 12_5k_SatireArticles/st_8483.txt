The flexibility afforded by a Prison Conference ( already referred to as the " PFC " according to internal documents ) is not lost on the NFL front office . Although when called for a reaction to the story NFL spokesman Greg Aiello predictably had no comment , it ' s easy to see how NFL management could more easily deal with the many transgressions of its players .

It would be a simple process for players to be traded from an AFC or NFC team to a PFC team . Salary caps would be a non issue in the PFC , where players would play for nominal prison wages ( approximately . 30 . 55 per hour ) , and the resulting reduction in overall labor costs would help the league ' s balance sheet across the board .
