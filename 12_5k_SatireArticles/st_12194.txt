" Count me in too , " said former NJ Democratic governor and MF Global CEO Jon Corzine . . I ' ve done all I can do here on earth , and Joe Biden and Newt both told me they need my monetary advice and management skills someplace far away ! And getting there is bound to be safer than driving on the NJ turnpike at 105 MPH without my seatbelt ! " Corzine , Biden ' s and Obama ' s former ' go to guy ' is said to be confidant he will get his pass port back and the ankle bracelet removed as soon as he receives his presidential pardon , or if he can locate the 1 . 2B missing from his fund . Which ever comes first . ( NPI )
