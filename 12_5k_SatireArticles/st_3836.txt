" A lot of parents have no idea the pressure today ' s teens are under , " Genzler said . " Kids today need strong guidance . See , I talk about these matters with my children , but not every parent does . That ' s why I like to discuss Paul ' s virginity in sermons , at youth groups , on retreats , at church dinners . . . whenever possible . He ' s a living example of the power of self respect and self love . "
