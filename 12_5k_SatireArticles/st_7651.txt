A source close to the band said " Noel ' s always been very sensitive about accusations of his work being derivative , and of the band ' s output being tired and formulaic . He feels that by snaring McCartney , Oasis would no longer be seen as a second rate Beatles tribute band , but as part of the evolutionary process of the actual Beatles . It would be a double whammy : Noel would be rid of Liam once and for all , and could stick two fingers up at his detractors .
