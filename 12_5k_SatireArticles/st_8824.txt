Liaison in a row over no hot food , was the last straw that involved a ' bust up ' for the tired old BBC Show called Top Gear . There wasn ' t a hot meal in a " luxury hotel " , a problem which should have been sorted before it became an World Wide issue ! Bearing in mind that the BBC used to make a reported 50 million per year out of the series , hot food was abolished on the new series , to safe the BBC money ! !
