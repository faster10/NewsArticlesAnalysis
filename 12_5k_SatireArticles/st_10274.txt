" Anyway , " Jotnose continued , " maybe some bikers are sissies . It depends on what your definition of " sissies " is . It sure looks to me like they all call each other in the morning to make sure they are all dressing alike . They are very aware of their fashion . Their individuality is shown by wearing identical garb and it ' s a well known fact that perverted sadomasochists get their leather and spikes from the same place as bikers . Look at Rob Halford of Judas Priest or Freddy Mercury of Queen . You can ' t deny that ' s some flaming leather there . Not that there ' s anything wrong with sissies , homosexuals , or rock stars .
