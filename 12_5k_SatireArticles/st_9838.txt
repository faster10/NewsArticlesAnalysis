CrackIt CEO , Premnath Shah said the idea grew out of his constant envy at parties and social gatherhings where the attractive , hip and mainstream would be constantly showcasing and discussing their cracked iPhone screens . He recounts his feeling isolated and left out , left to stare at his clean , fully un cracked iPhone . Shah said , " I knew I could never have a party life style that could legitimately yield a cracked screen , but there had to be a way to have an authentically cracked screen , one that I could share proudly to really fit in .
