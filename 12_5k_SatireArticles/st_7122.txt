( 6 ) . Sir . Richard Branson . . . for Her Majesty the Queen of England . He would rename it " Cooke ' s Other Island " and be able to give controlled media interviews about how clever he was in coming up with the name . He could have his own Masonic Lodge there with Michael Duke of Kent installed to look after it . And give great banquets there too , with invited BBC news readers reciting excerpts from Harry Potter and later , guests would get to stare through high power telescopes at the " Satellite Branson Rothchild No . 1 " . . . once known as " The Moon " .
