Scorsese goes on to describe in meticulous detail individual scenes " that alone should have won the Oscar , " including Travis Bickle posing with his guns in front of a mirror in Taxi Driver , the close up of coffee cups at the Debonair Social Club in Raging Bull , and the pool hall fight scene in Mean Streets . " Remember my scene in the back of the cab in Taxi Driver ? " Scorsese said . " That was me . I was that guy . That was me . Everyone remembers that . "
