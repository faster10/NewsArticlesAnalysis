Now Lord Richard keeps a bevy of economists as his court magicians and jesters . " Make the peasants believe they ' re in a meritocracy , " he ' ll order the court economists . And , as Lord Richard says , " they ' ll reach up their backside where they store their myths and legends , and start spouting the most astonishing foolishness . I ' ll command them to tell the tale of how we ' re all rational optimizers seeking to maximize our utility . And they ' ll do their little dance to distract from the fact that ours is a nation of Suckers with only one god . "
