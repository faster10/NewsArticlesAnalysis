" While those of us gathered in this room may have differences in our politics and our ideologies , there is one thing that unites every one of us : We are each the single most influential , valuable , and powerful person in countries composed of millions of people , and that is amazing , " said U . S . president Barack Obama in the summit ' s opening keynote address . " Every single thing we do simply because of who we are is very , very important . Honest to God , I could stand up here and recite a string of random numbers for two hours if I wanted and it would be front page news . Everything I ' m saying right now is going to be all over magazines and the internet , and here ' s what ' s really insane people will actually read every last word of it and analyze it . And best of all , nobody can tell us what to do nobody . Just think for a second about how goddamn incredible that is . "
