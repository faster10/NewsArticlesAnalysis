Levin was questioned about reports that the UAE had ties to al Qaeda prior to 9 11 and that perhaps al Qaeda terrorists will now find a way to infiltrate Major League Baseball . " I don ' t know about the UAE ' s ties to al Qaeda , " Levin said , " but , I could assure you that any baseball player found to be connected with al Qaeda will be suspended from baseball for at least 2 weeks and will never be inducted into the Hall Of Fame . Athletes should never get mixed up with any kind of political organizations , period ! "
