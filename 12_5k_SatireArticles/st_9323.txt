" The Norris choice is an easy one , " Mitt continued . " On the one hand , do I want the duplicitous and flip flopping Washington wimp Paul ( Ayn Rand fan before nonfan and Obama critic for opposing same Medicare changes as you did ) Ryan ? . . . Or do I choose Chuck Norris who said stuff like : ' If I want your opinion , I ' ll beat it out of you ' ( Code of Silence , 1985 ) and : ' If you come back in here , I ' m going to hit you with so many rights , you ' re going to beg for a left ' ( Invasion USA , 1985 ) and : ' Sleep tight , sucker ' ( The Delta Force , 1986 ) .
