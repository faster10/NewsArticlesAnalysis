Although facially the Grifinik resembles a modern human being and it is bipedal , has rudimentary speech and can learn simple tricks it is unique among primates in having 2 brains . These are , not surprisingly , weak neither has the capacity to form a coherent sentence so although the Grifinik can parrot the sayings of others it cannot , for example , enter into rational conversation or debate . For this reason , it finds it hard to make friends and this , in turn , leads to its low birth rate , one of nature ' s more fortunate quirks .
