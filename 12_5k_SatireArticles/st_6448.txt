" As a parent , I don ' t have a lot of time to dedicate to finding weed , " Minneapolis resident Kyle Berman said . " All my wife and I wanted to be able to do was get Tina and Tyler to bed , put on a movie , and smoke a joint . It wasn ' t until the police busted the guy across the street for growing marijuana that we realized how close we ' d come to actually finding some pot . A whole set up with lamps and everything was less than 50 feet from our living room . It sickens me to think about it . "
