Kell has used this dangerous power supply for over a year , and this vulnerability has been brought up several times on the support boards , but mostly as " what if " kind of posts . With all the desktop computers Kell currently sells , there have only been 3 reported cases of computers emitting smoke , but no full blown fires have occurred so far . These reports were on 3 different models of computers . Since a full backup had been kept of all the computers affected , no attempt was made to recover any data from the hard drives . The only statement Kell had to make : " Our policy is that unless property damage or any injury , however minor , occurs , it takes 2 incident reports on the same model of computer to trigger an investigation , and 5 incidents to trigger an automatic recall . "
