The political cartoonist reputation was destroyed and they were known as the person who created antisemitic cartoons , even being called antisemitic on a live news feed about a riot which was triggered by local racism and social unrest . The saying of when you cannot beat them , join them , was the philosophy this cartoonist stood by as they decided to begin being tolerant of an intolerant community in order to better understand what was causing this community to do such a thing . Upon doing so , the cartoonist has received more sells in paintings , books , and shirts , then ever before .
