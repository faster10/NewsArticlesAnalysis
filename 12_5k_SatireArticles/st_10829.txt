" Hootin ' Hana said , " Good for you . Do you want to pay for your grave on boothill now ? " " Later " I said as I turned on my heel , my spurs jingling as went out the swingin ' doors . The street was now deserted with the exception of a small boy passing by . " Hey son , " I called , " Where is everybody ? " " Are you stupid stranger , Lyin George is coming to town to gun you down . No one in Crawdad wants to be around when that happens . " With that he too disappeared . I felt alone . Ticklish Terry stayed in the bar listening to Hootin ' Hana , tell about her green dream . That is where her enemies turn green from the magic dust scattered by her fairy friends .
