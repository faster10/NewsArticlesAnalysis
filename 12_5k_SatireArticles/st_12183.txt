Besides organizing the ' Barney Frank in a Chumbucket ' chapter in Orlando , conjoined twins Buck ( r ) and Percival Pissgums enjoy being the only two ' real ' ex pirates at the WDW Pirates of the Caribbean show . Says Buck , " we ' d evens throwed up all over that liberal Johnnie Depp douchebag when ' s he visited us last year dressed as Captain Sparrow . What ' s kinda name is dat fer a real Capt ' un ? Percival wanted him to walk the plank before we ' s cornholed him , but security wouldn ' t let us . "
