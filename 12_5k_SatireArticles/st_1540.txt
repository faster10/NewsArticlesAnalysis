" Our lifestyles are expensive to maintain , " Boeing senior vice president of international relations Tom Pickering said . " The costs of even the most basic executive transportation , food , and clothing are staggering . Since 1993 , the average cost of maintaining a household of six , including a butler , a cook , a maid , a driver , and a groundskeeper , has increased by 14 percent . All this , even after we work our fingers to the bone for hundreds of hours a year , painstakingly assembling our benefits packages . It shouldn ' t have to be this hard . "
