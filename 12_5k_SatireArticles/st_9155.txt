" The only way we can hope to compete with the low cost of production in China . . . . is to lower our wages and our overall cost of production . Their workers are paid . . . on the average . . . . . 25 cents per hour . . . . so we must lower our labor costs , accordingly . However . . . . there are alot more Chinese , than there are of us . So . . . we will need to lower our cost of labor to about 6 cents per hour . . . if we wish to compete with everyone else in the world . " Gingrich stated .
