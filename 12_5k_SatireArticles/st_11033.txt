" First of all , the blessed Oversight Committee refused to give this bill their blessing . When you hear it , you will understand why . ( Shouts of " sit down ! " etc ) . . . because both Parties of this House are paid hirelings of a corrupt regime and the purpose of my bill , ( shouts and jeers ) . . . that you will not now be voting on . . . was to do something about that . Mr President and House members I contend that the notion of ' freedom ' promulgated by education , films , the media , our culture in general is a form of diabolical conditioning that threatens to bring havoc not only to us but to the rest of the world . Freedom is not what we are taught it is . Freedom is not doing what you want . . . to whoever you want , whenever you want , however you want , . . . for whatever you want . ( Shouts and jeers . A few skirmishes erupt in the benches and security officers are summoned to quell the riot . Many are led protesting from the chamber . ) How the truth hurts , ladies and gentleman . See for yourself !
