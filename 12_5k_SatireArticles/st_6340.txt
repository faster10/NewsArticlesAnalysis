" These Americans are destroying the moral and social fabric of our state , " said Rep . Chris Turner , who added that he worries when he looks around Texas and sees people from places like Pennsylvania , Iowa , and Vermont . " The man who used to repair my truck was replaced by some mechanic who moved in here from Kansas . Lately I can ' t go to the store or the bank without running into all kinds of these foreigners . This wall is the only hope we have of keeping Texas safe . "
