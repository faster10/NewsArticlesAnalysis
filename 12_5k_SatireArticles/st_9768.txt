Back at Trump ' s HQ in Midtown , we asked Donald about any impending lawsuits from traumatized guests at the club , like Greenshitz and his son . " Hey listen , " demanded a defiant Trump , " this is New York City you don ' t like it , leave ! But fine , if a few people come forward to whine about a few skulls here and there , so be it . I guess it wouldn ' t kill us to give guests that find a body part a free drink or something here and there , after their round . But if I know New Yorkers , and I think I do , they ' ll be digging up their Grandmothers in order to try and squeeze a free drink out of me ! "
