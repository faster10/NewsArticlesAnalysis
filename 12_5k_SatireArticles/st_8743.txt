Some clarity on the roots of this debate has been voiced by Professor Harry Stottle , Senior Fellow in Philosophy and Logic at Oxford University . ' The anti physics activists have not really grasped the fundamental difference between scientific and religious thinking , ' he explained to BBC News . ' Believers base their convictions on an emotionally driven certainty that what feels true , is true . There is generally no necessity for such beliefs to conform to any other framework . Physics , on the other hand , is an attempt to describe what actually underpins reality . Theories about it may change , but that underlying reality cannot be changed . A confusion between these two ways of describing the world , ' he concluded , ' appears to have led some Christians to believe that fervent faith in something is the only necessary criterion for it to be real .
