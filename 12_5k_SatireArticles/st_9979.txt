Translated " The chef would tell us when a shipment was coming in , always after dark . These really scary guys would come by in a pick up truck and the boss would send everybody out so that we could bring all the meat in at once , he said ' don ' t talk to them or look at them , we ' ll all eat steaks tonight ' . . . and he would let all the kitchen staff have steaks or whatever they wanted that night .
