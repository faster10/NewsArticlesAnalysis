According to Carol Paul , Friday ' s ' fling ' was not the first sexual encounter she has had with Gingrich . " We used to bang all the time back when my husband and Newt served in Congress together , " said Carol . " It really turned me on that Newt was Speaker of the House and had so much power , while my pathetic husband was virtually unkown . " This affair had died out for twenty six years after Gingrich resigned as Speaker of the House . " When he won the South Carolina primary , I just had to have him again . I was so turned on , " said Carol Paul .
