" The situation ? " you may ponder . Well , what the school didn ' t seem to grasp , was that the government funding was only for the one selected school with the most impressive plan . This school however , was not the school in question . Therefore , all students attending the school , must now seek education else where , as there is no funding for the new build , and the old has already been demolished . No further questions to be asked . The school has also requested that parents do not attempt to complain , as all of the more important staff as I write this are fleeing to a small town called Ilskov , located on the main island of Denmark .
