Timescale and budget for Cold War II are still unknown . However the plot , recently leaked to the public , is thought to revolve around George W Bush , a hapless US president , who sets off on a soul searching road trip across Europe in order to place a missile defence shield in the Czech Republic . The film is thought to concentrate on the zany Bush , who unwittingly fires a nuclear weapon at Moscow whilst tying his shoe lace . This causes his love interest , Putin , to chase after him with a oil embargo and cache of Polonium 210 .
