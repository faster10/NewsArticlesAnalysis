This has been a trying time for me and my family . The Fieldings have owned horses for generations , and we have never had a horse ' s value evaporate before our eyes as we did today . As soon as Rocky Top fell , I knew it was a race against time to get as much semen as we could out of him before he died of his injury , or exhaustion from being masturbated so vigorously . But just when it looked like there was reason for optimism , all that was taken away from us .
