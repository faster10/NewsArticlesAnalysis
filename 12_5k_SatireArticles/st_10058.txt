When the devil was interviewed in Diablo Monthly about Trumpmania he seemed quite jealous and rather admiring of the extent to which , he had duped America thus far . Certainly when he wins , it will pave the way for my return , finally . When asked if Trump was his trump card in the game of world domination he took up a poker player face and said maybe . The devil would also like to thank all his supporters for sticking by him during these last tough years of rational regression , but assured everyone that thanks to Trumpmania his plans for world domination now looked to be back on track . Diablo stocks were trading higher this morning based on this mid year corporate profit reporting and press releases .
