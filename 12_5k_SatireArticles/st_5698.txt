" Diagnostic testing has confirmed that our robot has developed a high concentration of malignancies throughout its entire structural framework , which , for all we know , could turn out to be incredibly important to science , " said lead researcher Amos Cruise , noting that the degenerative disease is corroding the machine ' s circuitry at a rapid rate , a development that he stated might potentially lead to further advancements in cancer research or robotics or maybe electrical engineering . " Never before has cancer been detected in a non biological entity , which seems like a pretty big achievement to me . I mean , it took three years of experimentation just to get cancer to take hold inside a robot , and anything that requires that much effort probably ends up being pretty useful , I imagine . "
