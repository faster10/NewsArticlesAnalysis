" Whoever said that violence never solved anything obviously never met my wife Edith , " says Nick Petrakis of Chicago . " For months , her constant nagging about my drinking , the bills , the drapes you name it drove me up the freaking wall . I tried marriage counseling , church , even so called ' quality time , ' but nothing worked . Then , one day , I finally hauled off and whaled her right in the solar plexus as hard as I could . "
