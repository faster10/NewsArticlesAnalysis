" It is true I had only been in the store for about 10 minutes . I hadn ' t shopped in a supermarket for over four years . When I lived in Scotland I chose small independent retailers such as Frank H Butlin Electricals and Archie Bruce and Sons in Glasgow . Asda was the only supermarket that would have tempted me back into a large chain store . I honestly believe I am the only customer that truly understands how Asda works . I have an affinity with the people that shop there , everyone knows that . However I was tempted in by some ' 2 for the price of 1 ? deals and they just don ' t exist . Apart from the offer on selected cheeses there was nothing . I feel totally let down . I genuinely hope things improve here . The Asda customers , and as I have said I love every single one of them , deserve so much better than this "
