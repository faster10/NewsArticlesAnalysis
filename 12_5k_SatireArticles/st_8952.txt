' Look , I don ' t accept that at all . In incentivising potential terrorists to be among the early adopters , we feel that it will give the security services a head start in finding who was responsible next time we have a terrorist atrocity . All of these details will be held on the National Identity Database , it ' ll save weeks of work interviewing people and putting bugs in prisons and mosques and generally following people around and then shooting them . Instead , all we will need to do is send them a letter asking them to fill in a questionnaire about their whereabouts . We ' ll piggie back these on the service partner ' s mailings and it will save a hell of a lot of money . '
