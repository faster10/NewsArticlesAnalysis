S . Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Lawrence Harley , adding that the deep divisions affecting Congress may in fact be endemic to the entire Washington region . " We are seeing similar levels of chaos and infighting in the Supreme Court and in many of the smaller cities and towns where extremists loyal to members of Congress have gained significant ground . Are we really prepared to risk American lives for what could be a lost cause ? "
