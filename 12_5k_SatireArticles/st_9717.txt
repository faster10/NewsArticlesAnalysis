Now some readers may be thinking : " Is this any way to talk about a war hero and a man who is part of a family of Navy Admirals ? " Well , hippies , I ' m not talking about John McCain the POW and the Navy brat right now . I ' m talking about the guy who emailed supporters for generous gifts of money . All the time berating President Obama .

And according to reports , the emails he sent maligning Obama and Congress offered no solutions , only complaints and criticism . Even the Foo Fighters were outraged that Mack Daddy the Snake Charmer snatched their song " My Hero " and used it as his campaign theme song in 2008 . You know nothing ' s copasetic with a politician when a rock band abhors such national exposure , which equates to a pounding ocean of free publicity .
