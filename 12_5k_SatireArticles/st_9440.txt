" I ' ve bent over backwards to meet Republicans half way . Even though it ' s true I rammed through Obamacare without a single Republican vote enforced only the parts of immigration law I liked made appointments during Congressional recesses let the IRS rattle the cages of conservative groups still I didn ' t do a public dance in the end zone . I was respectful of Republicans in their abject defeat . They were lying at my feet and I didn ' t trample them . Isn ' t that bipartisan ? And now see what all that restraint and consideration gets me ? Well , I ' ve drawn a new red line . No more Mr Nice Guy . He ' s on the other side watching me and Assad beat up on all these domestic terrorists . Assad has the Free Syrian Army to contend with I ' ve got to stop the whacko , anarchists in the Tea Party .
