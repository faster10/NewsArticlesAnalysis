" We categorically deny that Donald Trump is a Dark Horse candidate . Our records indicate that when Mr Trump was 17 , he attended one of our rallies in Manchuria . However , we have determined that Mr Trump was only visiting for entertainment purposes . He also gave our organization 3 . 2 million in 1987 , 4 . 6 million in 1995 , and 1 . 65 in 2003 . We regret that we took that money , but we were in desperate need of horse stalls for cute , baby dark ponies . Trump has also given us 302 , 500 baby horse blankets with Trump logos on them . And he has sent his son to be sacrificed in Manchuria a few times , but his offers were rejected . We have also received a lot of email correspondence from Mr Trump over the years , but we forwarded it all to the US State Department in 2011 . "
