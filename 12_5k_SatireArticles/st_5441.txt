" The U . S . is characteristic of an abused nation in that , even decades after noisily pushing away from Britain , it still maintained close contact with the motherland , took care of it , even giving it financial aid all the while fearing disapproval even though the parent country is now old , decrepit , and powerless , " said Bauffman , a prominent contributor to the fourth edition of the Democratic Symptoms Of Maltreatment handbook , or DSM IV . " On the other hand , Canada , which was raised in the very same continent by the same mother country , only exercised small scale resistance , remaining loyal well into its maturity . Though some see Canada as cold and remote , it has , unlike the U . S . , managed to lead a peaceful , reasonably healthy existence . "
