" We don ' t know which moon we ' ll use as a home base for the crew , " Kool said . " I guess we ' ll figure it out when we get out there . We ' ll definitely choose the moon that has the most hospitable atmosphere . We ' ve told our guys not to expect any Cancun or Caribbean way out there . It ' s just not going to happen . Life on any of the moons will be pretty damned bleak , but these guys are really tough . They can handle it . "
