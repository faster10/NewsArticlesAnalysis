" There ' s going to be this old tow truck driver who serves as Rob ' s mentor and teaches him everything he knows about tow trucking , " Beresford said . " That ' s based on Red Stampfel , the guy who was boss here when I started in ' 89 , " Beresford said . " He was like the Yoda of Central Montana Service Salvage : Boom tow , high line towing , righting a chassis , Stampfel knew it all . He died of a heart attack in ' 96 . In the movie version , the guy dies , too , but Rob continues to talk to him after he dies . "
