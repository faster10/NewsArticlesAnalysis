Rather than resist an increasingly weak yet ever more assertive Obama , GOP congressional leaders hand him whatever he wants . Thus , House speaker John Boehner and Senate GOP chief Mitch McConnell of Kentucky pushed through a 1 . 012 trillion budget with , at best , minuscule and illusory spending cuts . A 956 billion farm bill includes 3 million to promote Christmas trees ( who on Earth would buy them without federal assistance ? ) , 100 million for maple syrup market research , and 170 million for catfish protectionism . Boehner and McConnell sent Obama this gift wrapped monstrosity , which was 56 billion higher than Obamacare ' s original price tag . And in exchange , Obama gave them . . . zippo !
