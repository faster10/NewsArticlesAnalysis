" When we were developing the Super Snackers , people said to us , ' But you already have Smucker ' s Snackers ' , and people love them . Why mess with success ? ' " said Tolson , speaking from his office at SmuckerLabs . " But that ' s just not the way we do things here at Smucker ' s . Even if we have a popular product , we keep pushing the envelope by adding that extra ' Super ' prefix to it . Its all part of our commitment to providing the American consumer with the most enjoyable snacktime experience science will allow . "
