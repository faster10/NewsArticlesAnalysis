Cudahy ' s epic account is considered the most spectacular bong story in recent memory , eclipsing such legendary stoner anecdotes as the " 10 Gallon Gravity Bong " tale of Miami ' s Juan Hermosa , and the story of the time Austin , TX , stoner Greg Klesko saw this one bamboo 15 footer some dude supposedly brought back from Vietnam like 30 years ago . The tale is even regarded as surpassing Hermosa Beach , CA , stoner Randy Porter ' s celebrated story of the time he was 16 and visited his older brother at USC and saw this one bong made out of this clear globe , an aquarium air pump and , like , 10 yards of PVC pipe or something .
