" The wildman initially started in the northeast portion of Los Padres National Forest at about 10 : 15 a . m . and has since quickly torn across hundreds of acres of land , " said California Department of Forestry spokesman Jacob Richardson , adding that this is by far the biggest wildman the region has seen in years . " Our primary concern right now is keeping the wildman away from houses and heavily populated areas . We ' re doing our best , but he ' s just moving too fast through the brush . "
