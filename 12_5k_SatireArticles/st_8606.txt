" Those French bicyclists never stood a chance against top American athletes like me , " said Armstrong . " The Frenchees were too busy hogging down big lumps of stinky cheese and drinking that swill they call wine . I always stayed in front of them during races just so I wouldn ' t have to breath all the noxious fumes from those guys ! I was able to peddle harder because I gobbled down a few Big Macs and chocolate shakes before every race . I never needed that EPO stuff McDonalds was my secret weapon . "
