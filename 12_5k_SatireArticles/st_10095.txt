" I honk at people all the time , " says Ilene Troy , 32 of Kansas City . " If someone does something I don ' t like , I let them know it ! If you pull out in front of me , I ' ll honk . If you run a red light , I ' ll honk . If you don ' t use a round about properly , I ' ll honk . I have a horn , and I ' m not afraid to use it ! "
