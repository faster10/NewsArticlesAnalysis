In 1994 , the Mexican physicist Miguel Alcubierre proposed in the Journal of Classical and Quantum Gravity a method of stretching space in a wave which would in theory cause the fabric of space ahead of a spacecraft to contract and the space behind it to expand . The ship would ride this wave inside a region known as a warp bubble of flat space . Since the ship is not moving within this bubble , but carried along as the region itself moves , conventional relativistic effects such as time dilation do not apply in the way they would in the case of a ship moving at high velocity through flat spacetime . Also , this method of travel does not actually involve moving faster than light in a local sense , since a light beam within the bubble would still always move faster than the ship it is only " faster than light " in the sense that , thanks to the contraction of the space in front of it , the ship could reach its destination faster than a light beam restricted to travelling outside the warp bubble . Thus , the Alcubierre drive does not contradict the conventional claim that relativity forbids a slower than light object to accelerate to faster than light speeds .
