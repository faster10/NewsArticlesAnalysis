Unlike the previous bill of rights , this one will cost money . As so eloquently stated by committee vice chair Bag O . Gold , " It is time freeloaders stopped enjoying the Bill of Rights without paying a dime . You have to pay for the right to drive a car ( drivers license ) , you have to pay for the right to enjoy national parks ( entrance fee ) , why should you be able to enjoy the bill of rights without paying a penny ?
