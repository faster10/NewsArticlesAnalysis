As The Teletubbies topped the children ' s TV ratings , Rosie and Jim ' s career fell in to a permanent decline . " Our ratings went down but our lavish lifestyle didn ' t . In the summer of 2000 after the last show had been broadcast in the UK we went to LA for a month to hob nob with our fellow A Listers . We had bottles of Jack Daniel ' s down the sunset strip every night , courtside seats for Basketball matches and invites to Tom Cruises parties . My trick was to put mini doughnuts on my member and get Rosie to nibble them off . Lets just say Rosie got a bit too close on a number of occasions and got an extra cream filling ! Ozzy and Sharon loved that one . Unfortunately when we got back home the money had been spent . Top Coke and fifty dollar steaks don ' t pay for themselves . We tried to live a comfortable suburban lifestyle but the booze kept on flowing and the drugs kept on being taken . We went from nice houses to shit houses , good office jobs to working in the f cking scrap yard to make ends meet and here we are . "
