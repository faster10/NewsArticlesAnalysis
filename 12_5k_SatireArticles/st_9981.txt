While it is a well known fact that Texas women like their big hair as much as the men like their cowboy hats and boots , few realize that the state ' s Office of Tourism and Heritage financially supports those big hairdos in the form of hair spray subsidies . That ' s right . Should DAPA and DACA are implemented , it could cost the state a few hundreds of dollars to subsidize female Mexican immigrants ' big hair . Everyone knows these women have long thick hair and would likely take advantage of the subsidy to have big hair . Just look at any picture or portrait of Frieda Kahlo .
