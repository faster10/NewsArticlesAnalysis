On Wednesday , May 1 , the USA Today newspaper took this topic up for debate on their editorial page . Unfortunately , they did not actually follow deate or jounalistic procedures as both of their editiorials approved the change ( and both thought that the scouts were not going far enough ) . Shame on you , USA Today ! Debate is supposed to show both sides of an issue and not the same side stated in two different ways . I just bought my last issue of your paper .
