" I completely understand Kaiwalya ' a pain , " said Tanuj while having walnut muffin with lime pickle . " Studying the entire night before and then failing the exam can really hurt . I have experienced this first hand which is why I gave up studying before exams altogether . All I can advise Kaiwalya is to pick himself up and give his best for the stool and urine tests that shall take place shortly and pass them with flying colours . Those are his only chances at redemption . "
