I want to invite more rich people and business executives into the country and what do the rich have ? Car ' s . Loads of em . We need a space large enough to store up to . . . like . . . . six million cars . The terrible un mown heaths of Scotland will be perfect for this . For entertainment we can take them to the " Northern Powerhouse " in England and laugh at the poor trying to survive on Pay Day loans . What larks !
