What really didn ' t help Hemmera ' s and Ol ' Cowboy Jeff ' s case much ( showing prejudice in the matter ) was the overlooked fact that the principal Ol ' Cowboy Jeff was a member of the local motorcycle club " Satan ' s Silly Barbers " . The club is made up of local professionals , gay and straight , who get together and do good things for the community . According to Ol ' Cowboy Jeff , he is straight as can be but got " made sport of quite a bit in school " because of his taste in clothing , Liza Minnelli 8 Track Tapes , his swishy walk , his lisp , and getting caught dressing like and trying to become a girl cheerleader and member of the pep squad .
