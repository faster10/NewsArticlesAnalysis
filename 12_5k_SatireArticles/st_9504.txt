Logic dictates that we have been and most likely will be subjects of observation without any interaction by extremely high life forms . This behavior can be observed in a human and a lion . A human that walks by a tortoise would observe the tortoise without touching it and after a few seconds the person would walk away . A lion on the other hand would physically play with the tortoise and claw at it before leaving it alone . Two different intelligent life forms with different intelligence levels and with two different behavior patterns directed at the tortoise .
