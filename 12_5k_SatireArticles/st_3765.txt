" Close mentoring relationships are vital if we want more women to succeed in this business , but every now and then it ' s really satisfying to just smack a younger colleague down real quick and watch her go crawling back to her desk , " said Miller , admitting that after all the positive reinforcement and support she administers each day , the experience of brusquely putting a coworker in her place is an enjoyable , refreshing change of pace . " It feels great to know I ' m helping other women . Of course , it also feels great to blow off some steam by telling someone that , given her limited skills , she ' s lucky to have a job here at all . "
