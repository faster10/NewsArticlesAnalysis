According to the US Bureau of Geophysics , which runs the nation ' s network of gravity control stations , the nation ' s gravity reserves are at an all time low . Unless additional sources of supply can be brought on line in the next 2 years , the nation will face its first ever gravity deficit . The report calls for an additional investment of 17 billion over the next 5 years , simply to keep pace with the ever growing demand for gravity . Without it , we will all have to start changing the way we live .
