' There have been some complaints from homeowners , ' admitted UK Housing Minister , Grant Shapps , ' about council tax rate increases that have resulted from the Universe expanding , rather than from traditional property extensions . However , ' he continued , ' in a recent High Court judgement , it was concluded that rateable values could be increased on those grounds . The judges reasoned that , although the extra floor area caused by the expansion of space time was not the fault of the homeowner , that person still benefited from increased room sizes . It must also be remembered , ' he concluded , ' that the self same cosmic phenomenon has given householders additional time to pay their bills . '
