Poking the body with the toe of his boot , Boudreaux asked , " What in IS this thing ? I ' ve stuffed a lot of animals in my day . . . hell , I even preserved a Sasquatch last year . . . but I ain ' t never seen nothing like this ! Damn , it ' s ugly ! " Investigators questioned Mr Phipps a few hours later , but came away with few leads , dismissing him as , " just a hostile old coot who does good taxidermy . "
