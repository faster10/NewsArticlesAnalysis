" We have negotiated what we feel is a fair , and equal divide of our possessions , " Jerry added , " we are splitting everything right down the middle , fifty fifty . What does this mean to the consumer ? They will have to make a choice . For example they will no longer be able to buy ' Ben Jerry ' s Strawberry Cheesecake ' flavour , rather they will have to chose between ' Ben Strawberry ' flavour or ' Jerry ' s Cheesecake ' . "
