Happiness , one of the disaffected emotions said : " Before Joce would laugh out aloud , her eyes would crinkle up in joy , her ruby red lips open up and a smile would spread across her face from ear to ear . There were happy lines everywhere . Now there is nothing . Everything stays the same . No movement . No creasing . No crinkling . Just a muffled guffaw and a slight pursing of the lips . And that ' s when she ' s truly ecstatic ! The happy lines are gone forever . "
