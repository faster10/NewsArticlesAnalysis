Mr Turnbull repeated the statement he made in Parliament yesterday that he will not be influenced by terrorist activities by the extra terrestrials . He said that their cries of " Discrimination ! " were silly and to be ignored . He said " We are not discriminating against them . We just don ' t want them . " He added that Australia has too many of them and they should be sent somewhere else . He suggested Antarctica as a possible settling place for them . He said that since they come from a planet that is closer to their sun than the Earth is to ours and hotter they should settle very well there . " The cold will be very good for them " he said , " and will keep them from outbreeding the human population of Australia and the rest of the world . "
