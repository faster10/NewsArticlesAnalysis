One American voter put his opinion this way : " House and Bones are my favorite Fox shows . When it is American Idol season , both series have many weeks where they are not shown at all or have their times moved around . I ' m voting for the Indian kid just because if someone that bad wins , it may screw up the show so much it won ' t come back . Then I can watch my shows and not have to go eight weeks without an new episode of House . "
