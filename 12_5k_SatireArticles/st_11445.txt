President Bush , a Yank who can ' t even eat a pretzel without making an idiot of himself , also disagreed with the new law , saying , " This law is fundament al al ly wrong . Chirac has been allowed to bully the nation of frogs for too long . And it ' s obvious that this dude has got way too many WMDs hidden in secret caves in his country . I feel it is our moral responsibility to ensure that the French are liberated . Therefore we propose a 24 hour time zone in which Chirac can stand down as President , or else the coalition will invade France , in order to make the world a safer place . "
