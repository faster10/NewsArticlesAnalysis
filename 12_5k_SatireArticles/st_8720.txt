Local food safety official , Ivor Youngbride , was called in to investigate . He told us , " When I arrived at the premises of ' McNab ' s Kebabs ' I was appalled at the lack of basic hygiene . I took swabs of all the surfaces and returned to my lab to examine the results . What I found was shocking . The whole shop was covered in the potentially deadly bacteria known as ' Shitus Alotus . ' I have instructed the owner , Mr Rab McNab , to complete a full cleansing operation which I shall supervise . "
