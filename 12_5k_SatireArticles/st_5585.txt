" I ' m lying a lot more , and my lies are far more egregious than they ' ve ever been , " a smiling Romney told reporters while sitting in the back of his campaign bus , adding that when faced with a choice to either lie or tell the truth , he will more than likely lie . " It ' s a strategy that works because when I lie , I ' m essentially telling people what they want to hear , and people really like hearing things they want to hear . Even if they sort of know that nothing I ' m saying is true . "
