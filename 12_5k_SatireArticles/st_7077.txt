" Recent research , " said May Seesaw , head of advertising at Macy ' s , " has shown that one in five hundred men regularly cross dress . In America , that ' s two and a half million men . As an advertiser , that ' s a demographic bigger than single working aunties no kids yet , or SWANKYs as we call them . We ' ve yet to come up with a snappy name for the demographic yet , but once we do , we ' re sure that they ' ll be more widely accepted . America loves a consumer ! "
