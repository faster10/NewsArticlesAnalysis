" It would have taken us years to see all this stuff if we ' d had to travel all over the country . And I ' ve gotta say , it was pretty cool to walk through the doors of Frank Lloyd Wright ' s Fallingwater and look out on Mount Rushmore in the very spot where the Battle of Bunker Hill took place .
