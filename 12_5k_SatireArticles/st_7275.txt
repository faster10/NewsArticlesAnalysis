" I can ' t believe they picked somebody else , not me , " said Le Bon . " I ' m famous ! We ' ll have to see what happens tomorrow . Just because we ' ve been falling down the charts doesn ' t mean we ' ve gone ! Hopefully , Rio will give us a call for their opening ceremony . We ' ll save a prayer for that to happen . Our manager is dealing with it now . All she wants is for us to be famous again . "
