" I was punching in my door combo when he came up to me and asked me for help with his e mail , " Arnell said . " So I go to his room , and I ' m setting up his UF campus account , and I start to notice all this weird stuff on his walls , like this cross on his bulletin board and this poster that said , ' I am the light and the world ' or something . He even had one of those metal fish symbols like you see on cars . Then , when it came time to choose his password , he types in ' Corinthians , ' and I was like , ' Oh , shit , get me out of here . ' "
