" I don ' t know why I liked The Kidnapping and Rescue of Eddie Guest , " Spielberg is quoted as saying in Hollywood Hell . " It seems there are far too many really terrible scripts emerging from Hollywood these days . It ' s almost as if producers and directors are expected to create really terrible movies . I wanted to find the most atrocious of fiction trainwrecks . After perusing smishsmash for the better part of last winter , I found an electronic version of this horrible mess or alphabet soup . I asked myself , ' Why not make this thing into a movie ? ' So I did . "
