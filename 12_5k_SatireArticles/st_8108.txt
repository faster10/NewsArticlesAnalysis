Clint Eastwood has had to combat the rumours of being a cowardly man ' s son , by becoming harder and harder in every film , until he is now made of steel and shoots fellow actors using real bullets . Eastwood said " If anyone asks me if Stan Laurel is my father again I will be forced to . . . . hide under the bed covers with my bottom in the air , cry and beg my fat friend to help me . So go on make my day " . Mr Eastwood then scratched his head and made his hair comically stick up and his knees knock together in fright .
