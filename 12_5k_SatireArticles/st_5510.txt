" We get a guy interested , see , " Parker said . " We show him pictures and tell him how lovely the place is : the all new moldings , the built in fireplace , the vaulted ceilings . ' They don ' t make ' em like this anymore , ' that whole rap . Then we pick him up wherever he wants , in broad daylight . He doesn ' t suspect a thing . We take him right in through the front door , just like we own the place , hand on his arm . Real friendly . Real friendly . We lead him around , maybe I say something about the screened in porch or flagstone patio or some snow job like that , and I sneak behind him so I can see him but he can ' t see me . Then , when he walks through the French doors into the living room . . . blammo ! "
