Each of the organs in our bodies is the result of millions of years of honing by nature to produce frighteningly efficient specialised machines . It seems therefore wasteful to demand one , or in the case of kidneys , testicles and ovaries , to name but a few , two of these organs per person . Particularly when for much of the time these organs lay dormant , merely consuming valuable oxygen and nourishment . We have become a truly selfish species and now , thanks to the wizardry and insight of scientists , we can at last redress this terrible ethical shortcoming .
