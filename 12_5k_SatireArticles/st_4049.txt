Opened my eyes to the sunrise I can smell oatmeal and toast and juice My favorites ! The sun ' s rays stream through my window Taking away the darkness The branches that scratched against my window all night Are warmed in the sun ' s heat Wasn ' t I silly to ever doubt or fear ? Mom is bringing my breakfast tray up to my room There ' s oatmeal and toast And juice ! Thank you , God , for this brand new day Another day to weave a new tapestry of hope .
