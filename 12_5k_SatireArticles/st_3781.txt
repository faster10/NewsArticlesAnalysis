Phelps , the 6 ' 4 " , 200 pound aquatic mammal , and the first ever SeaWorld swimmer to be raised in captivity by foster swimmers ( Mark Spitz and Dara Torres ) , was recaptured by trainer Bob Bowman in a hoop net baited with an entire Dutch apple pie following Phelps ' final Olympic event last Sunday . Phelps was then tethered to the rudder of a container ship bound for St . Petersburg , guided down local waterways , and introduced back into his home habitat , the tank in SeaWorld ' s 5 , 500 seat stadium , known to park officials and visitors alike as " Phelps ' Happy Harbor .
