In this case , our politicians are addicted to tax revenue . It doesn ' t matter which party ( Republicans or Democrats ) , or how they get the money . It doesn ' t even matter to them if the bill goes to our unborn children . In California , the common pol addiction is to the tax revenue of cars and the gas that drives them through the toll roads to the Dept of Motor Vehicles to pay for registration and license . And with 30 , 000 , 000 cars in California , that is a heavy addiction they are dealing with . Said Dr Drew , " usually an addicted person can go through about 1 , 000 a week . But with these politicians we are talking about an addiction in the billions of dollars a year . " And with 30 , 000 , 000 cars , eventually , you see the problem everywhere you look , on the road , in the parking lots , on the grass , in the front living room . . . cars are everywhere .
