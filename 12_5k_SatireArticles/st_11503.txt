Billions of dollars in Indian money will leave the country and go into the hands of the few Wal Kart investors that own the corporation . The investors will spend the billions of dollars that come from Indian money on luxury goods from Europe and on expensive western real estate . None of that money will return to India to help the Indian economy . For example , Sandy Wallace is the wife of late James B . Wallace , one of Wal Kart ' s investors . After his death in January 2008 , she inherited his fortune of 15 . 7 billion . As of September 2010 , she is the 4th richest person in Canada according to the Norbes 400 list and the 12th richest person in the Norbes World ' s Billionaires . In the future most of her money as well as money from other Wal Kart investors will come from the Indian working class who will not have any opportunities of ever owning their own retail establishment .
