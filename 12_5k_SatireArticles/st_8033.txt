LET ' S TALK MONEY : Never mind these geographical details , I ' ve got money on my mind . I can ' t believe that the half of the 5 bill wasn ' t dug out of that rock of ice . I thought Bostonians were a lot more clever and opportunistic than letting something like this go hey , there ' s got to be the other half of that Abe Lincoln note buried nearby . What gives ? I have half a notion to jump a freight train headed to Massachusetts to dig around that junkpile myself ! There ' s a pack of generic cigarettes entombed there , if I can find that other half and tape them together so a convenience store clerk will accept it as currency .
