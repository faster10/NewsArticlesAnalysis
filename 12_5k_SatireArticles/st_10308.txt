" My point is that if Hillary Clinton should lose , rest assured every woman in America has won , " said Obama , appearing even more visibly shaken as he continued , struggling with his speech . " What I ' m trying to say to you is whomever I choose as my vice president know that it will be the best man for the job . Wait What I mean is all you women folk will no longer be expected to be satisfied with just making snow angels . No , now you can finally stand side by side next to your husbands , brothers , fathers and sons as equals and proudly write your names in the snow right alongside them . Damn it ! That didn ' t come out right either . "
