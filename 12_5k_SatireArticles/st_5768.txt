" A bunch of us from the dorm took a weekend trip to Cordoba , which isn ' t too far away , " Blevins said . " It wound up being pretty similar to Seville , with all these orange trees and churches and stuff , but it was still pretty cool . Me and Pete and Chris , these two Ohio State guys I went with , met up with a bunch of their friends from school who happened to be there on winter break . They ' d just come from Barcelona and told us all about the scene there . Then we all went to Granada and checked out this nightclub opened by this other guy they all knew . It was cool : They had pretty good paella there , but otherwise it was pretty much just like any bar back in Bloomington . "
