When Burlison was asked how the friends got this information , he replied , " They were camping out in the desert when they saw and heard a huge explosion nearby . Thinking it was a plane crash , they ran to the wreckage to help , but were horrified by the scene once they arrived . It wasn ' t a plane . It was some kind of unfamiliar aircraft that contained 16 mangled bodies . The bodies weren ' t humanoid and the sight was so terrifying they ran back to their campsite , packed up and left . "
