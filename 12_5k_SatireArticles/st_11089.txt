And it gets even phonier and more sickening : The whole concept about having this hunt for an endangered species ( like black rhinos ) was for The Safari Club to raise money for the further proliferation of the building up of numbers of this big , brawny , bad tempered beast , the Daily Kos article goes on to explain . Maybe all this dough can be spent for baby formula for infant black rhinos . Black rhinos are loveable darlings when they ' re little tikes , but when they grow up to be dreadful , obscenely horrendous , horned bulls , it ' s best just to leave them alone . If one is chasing you , you might as well have the wrath of hell flying your way . And that ' s what humankind has been mandated to do just leave these animals alone . And for crying out loud , don ' t shoot at them with high powered rifles like this bonehead Corey Knowlton . A canned and controlled wild animal killing even one held to kill something as dangerous and testy as a black rhino is as safe as little kids bobbing for apples at a Halloween party . There ' s very little chance of one of the apples jumping out of a tub and biting Little Suzie or Jumpin ' Johnnie on the chin . As you can see from the photos in the accompanying articles , this entitled monster with the big bad gun had more than enough guides to act as his human shields if the rhino actually charged and had an intent to do some irreparable harm . The guides , all experienced big game hunters , no doubt , and armed to the hilt , look like they ' re part of a local contingency of some paramilitary operative just by perusing the various photos accompanying the media storm that was plastered all over cyberspace Tuesday afternoon and night . Meantime , Mr " Might Is Right My Daddy Has More Money Than God " Knowlton , whose father owns a private energy firm named BASA , is pictured here with a wide , beaming , shit eating grin . Obviously proud , he looks like he just won WW I all by his lonesome lonely self .
