" Christianity was pretty cool before Jesus came back , " remarked Christian unconvert Canaanite Baal , formerly known as Paul Cross . " I mean , it didn ' t take itself so seriously , and it managed to make religion fun and entertaining . But Jesus is just plain out of control . First he got rid of Christmas . Then he changed the lyrics to ' Amazing Grace . ' And now he ' s trying to ban Mixed Martial Arts . The guy pretty much ruined a religion that had a successful 2500 year run without him . "
