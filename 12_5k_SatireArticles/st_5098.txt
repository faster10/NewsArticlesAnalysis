" One cannot overstate the break from tradition this represents , " said lay administrator Bruce McConnachie of the Los Angeles archdiocese . " After all , under church doctrine , the act of seducing a priest is considered a grave sin against the laws of God , punishable by condemnation to Hell for all eternity . But the pope has put all of that aside . He has let bygones be bygones . For this , all of those misbehaving , sexy little guys should feel grateful . By showing such willingness to forgive and forget , the pope has sent a clear message : Even though these boys have done much to undermine and subvert the priestly vows of celibacy , they are still deserving of God ' s love .
