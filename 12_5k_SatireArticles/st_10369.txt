Joe the Plumber told our reporters that he is in complete agreement with Obama . " Sure we ' ll have to pay a little bit more in taxes , but in return we get to control the lives of people who we would otherwise have no chance of controlling ! ! We will be able to dictate the rules to fat cat CEOs , we will take away their corporate jets , their high salaries , their dignity and their pride , we will force them to do things our way ! ! " When we asked President Obama whether he thought this is a sustainable strategy in the long run , he replied " We have to be pragmatic , in the long run we are all dead , this works now , and my successor will figure something else out tomorrow " .
