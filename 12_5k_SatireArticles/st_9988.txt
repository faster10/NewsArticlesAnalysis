Bethany Deutsche , organizer of the event said of it ' s importance , " They don ' t want us using the public facilities by they , I mean not just people at this church and not Lutherans per se but religious nuts . We wanted to go straight to the belly of the beast and target a Baptist church but figured we ' d get shot by the deacons . Then we considered the Catholics but figured they wouldn ' t really care that much , so we settled on the Lutherans . "
