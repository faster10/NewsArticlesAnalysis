Web engineers within the MagicFrame company are attempting to put a stop to the pop ups . Company representative Alvin Munkchip said " Our system currently allows you to send a code to family and friends that allow them to download pictures to your frame from any computer . We may have to change our system to send it to your computer first , and then have you download which pictures you want to the frame . This would take out the uniqueness of our product , but it is the only thing we can come up with to keep people from seeing inappropriate ads . "
