" That ' s crap that is . I HATE Big Brother . I mean , what ' s the point of sitting around in your living room watching other people sit around in a living room . Julie Burchill is a moron . And a hypocrite . She spends her life swanning about down that London talking bollocks and getting paid for it . She says that snobby people pretend to hate Big Brother because it may associate them with Joe Public , who has a proper job and loves Big Brother .
