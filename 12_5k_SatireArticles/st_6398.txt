" All our lives , or at least from the time it was first played in 1967 , we believed the Super Bowl was something to be won , but we never bothered to question , What if that ' s all wrong ? What if that ' s all just hubristic bullshit ? " said Robert Holcomb , owner and head bartender of Rob ' s Sports Dugout in Wantagh , NY . " So yeah , I ' ll open my bar and watch these people cheer for their team , but maybe for the first time , I won ' t know what they ' re really cheering for . In the end , aren ' t we all just a barely self aware collection of atoms ? Couldn ' t we all return to dust at any moment ? "
