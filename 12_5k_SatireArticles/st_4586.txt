According to terms of the deal , the Food Network will schedule broadcasts of over 50 full length hockey games and will carry both the Eastern and Western Conference Semi Finals , as well as Games 4 through 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals . The only exception , Bettman said , would be made for Rachael Ray , who appears on television roughly three times more than the NHL . In the case of Ray experiencing a scheduling conflict , hockey games will be postponed and rescheduled at Ray ' s convenience .
