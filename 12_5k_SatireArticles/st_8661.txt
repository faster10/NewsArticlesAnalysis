The London Olympics will deliver plenty of profits and backhanders for our developers , lots of free tickets to our corporate chums that we ' d previously lied about giving to ordinary Londoners and then there ' s all those wonderful new stadiums that have cost taxpayers an arm and a leg . They ' ll of course be bulldozed to make way for executive housing or sold to already fantastically wealthy football clubs so that they can bulldoze and then rebuild them because they don ' t like running tracks " .
