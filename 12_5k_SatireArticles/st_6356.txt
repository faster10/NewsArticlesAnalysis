I got to Miami in the afternoon and drove a rental car to the arena . I found a parking garage a few blocks away . They tried to charge me eight bucks for a ticket , but I said no way , that is way too much . But the person at the booth said that is the price and I have to pay it . I could have gotten the receipt and had it paid for by the network , but I didn ' t want to pay eight bucks for parking . What is a parking spot ? It is just an empty space . I don ' t think you should pay for an empty space on the ground , especially not eight bucks , which adds up . But anyway I took the ticket and went to park .
