Famous writer of sensual odes , John Bleates , also stayed on the island twice , between 1817 and 1819 . He escaped to the island with his friend , Tom Browne , in an effort to cure himself of the contemporary disease of opium exacerbated narcissistic sensuality . He was able to rid himself of this blight , but , sadly , fell victim to consumption , which eventually killed him . But not before he had produced some of the English language ' s greatest poetry . While staying at Shanklin and later at Mottistone , he worked on his celebrated Ode to a Sea Plover , which explores the parameters of life and death as symbolised by the shifting boundaries of land and sea .
