" Oh , something like , ' Thelma Louise , an edited for television feature starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis , contains adult situations and graphic violence , ' " Thompson said . " Whatever it is , I expect the American public to remain calm during the brief interruption of Kickboxer , as frequent disruptions are a normal part of the basic cable viewing experience . Take Jean Claude Van Damme ' s movies alone : We ' ve seen Bloodsport , Universal Soldier , and even Timecop interrupted . In every case , the network , whether it was AMC , TBS , or Spike , has always made good on its promise . "
