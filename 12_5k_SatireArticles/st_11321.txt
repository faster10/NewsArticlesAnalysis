" Most airlines welcome trees aboard their aircraft and provide they are adequately strapped in , they are perfectly safe . I remember taking my 6 foot Caucasian Fir ( Abies nordmanniana ) to Corfu last year . It was fun all the way ! We watched the in flight T . V . which featured that excellent programme ' The Vicar of Dibley ' and then I treated him to a Baby Bio and Bacardi cocktail . It was sheer joy to watch how his little needles began to bristle and glow ! "
