When KW Pop Up Trendy Store Manager was asked about warranty with purchases he advised the store would be closing in several hours and everyone would have to wait until it ' popped up again ' . When pushed as to when that may be they replied " it is our policy to not discuss policy or the details of any commercial arrangement that may or may not be ongoing at this time , we will not expose any current negotiations as when the public find out , terrorists everywhere win and innocent lives are put at risk , and further we are unable to confirm or deny that boat refugees were throwing their KW Trendy Jeans overboard , but it sure seemed that way " .
