" My friend Kyle was the first person I knew who got IKEA , " said Adam Goldman , a Manhattan web designer who said he now knows " 20 or 30 people " who have the furniture . " I was at his place on a Friday night , and everything was normal . He mentioned that he was going out to shop for a little bookcase the next day . A week later , his whole place was so thick with blond birch veneer and chrome wire shelving that he could barely stand up . "
