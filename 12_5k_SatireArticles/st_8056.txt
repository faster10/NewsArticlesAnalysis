" Yes and no . I ' ve read a lot of Dickens and Shakespeare . And I ' m a big fan of John Keats and I also love William Makepeace Thackeray , even through I can ' t understand a sentence he wrote . But I ' ve never walked across the Cliffs of Dover , or fed those nasty scruffy pigeons wobbling around Trafalgar Square , thrown rocks in the Thames , insulted one of those guys in those tall fuzzy hats involved with ' the change of the guard ' nor have I ever met the Queen . So no , I ' ve never visited there in the physical sense . "
