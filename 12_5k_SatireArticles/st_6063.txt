" I hear my Whig detractors mutter , ' Preposterous ! ' and , ' Who shall build this foul rail road , and where ? ' " Thurmond said . " Well it is no mere Opium dream , and I propose to build it in the great Western Desert , which will be ideal once the Great Canyon is filled in and its hellish mesas and cacti are destroyed by dynamite . The region is home to no one , save the Red Indian , and these heathen savages may be either exterminated or relocated to less valuable land , such as the so called oil fields of Oklahoma , where noisome substances bubble out of the Earth .
