WASHINGTON , DC In an emergency White House address Sunday , President Bush urged all people dying from several days without food and water in New Orleans to " tap into the American entrepreneurial spirit " and gnaw on their own bootstraps for sustenance . " Government handouts are not the answer , " Bush said . " I believe in smaller government , which is why I have drastically cut welfare and levee upkeep . I encourage you poor folks to fill yourself up on your own bootstraps . Buckle down , and tear at them like a starving animal . " Responding to reports that many Katrina survivors have lost everything in the disaster , Bush said , " Only when you work hard and chew desperately on your own footwear can you live the American dream . "
