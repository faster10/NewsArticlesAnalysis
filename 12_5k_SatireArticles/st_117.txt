" The Gazette is pretty much the ears and eyes of Crestline , " Schoepke said . " If something ' s happening in Crestline , you ' ll read about it here . That means I ' m pretty busy most of the time . For example , today I went over to the sporting goods store to do a story on the scuffle over fishing licenses , then I dropped by the new bakery on Spruce Road , and then I headed over to the high school to cover the big wrestling tournament .
