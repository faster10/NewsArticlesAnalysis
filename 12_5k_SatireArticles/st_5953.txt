" That strange looking guy wandered into the office just before lunch , looking more confused than the freshmen do , " principal Courtney Delaterra said . " I asked him if he needed help , and I guess my voice startled the poor guy , because he spun around and dropped several manila folders packed full of papers and news clippings and things . He had more paper than a person generally carries . When I introduced myself as the principal , it actually made him more nervous . I ' ve seen some pretty high strung people in my day , but that guy was a real mess . "
