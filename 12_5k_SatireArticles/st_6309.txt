" If somebody complains about how bad it sucks to work overtime five days straight , I just nod and agree , " said Braxton , who spends his weeknights at parties , at concerts , and playing basketball in the park . " No point in rubbing in the fact that no matter how busy things are , I leave at exactly 5 p . m . every single day . If anyone asks me to stay later , I just say my agency doesn ' t let me do overtime . "
