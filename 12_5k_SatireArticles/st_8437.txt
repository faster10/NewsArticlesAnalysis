" We left our lights on at the end of the season and woahhh you should have seen our electric bill . Huge . We were saddled with a 80million quid bill and EON threatened to take away some of our assets if we didn ' t pay up . We didn ' t want to see Alexis being dragged into the back of a repo wagon so we paid up . Unfortunately it means we have no transfer budget this season . Or next season . Hell let ' s never have one again ! "
