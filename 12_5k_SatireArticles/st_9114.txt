" We did consider running a headline about the Eurozone crisis , " one editor remarked . " We thought about tying it in with the protests in Greece over the austerity measures , but let ' s face it nobody in the UK gives a toss about the Euro zone , unless they ' re there on holiday and it ' s pissing down , or their tour operator has gone bust , so we binned that idea . We opted instead for a completely fabricated story about Emma Watson out of the Harry Potter films having her nipples pierced and snogging Pippa Middleton in a decadent Ayia Napa nightclub . You can criticise us if you like , but we ' re giving the public what they want . "
