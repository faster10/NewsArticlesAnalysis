" When I first met Brendan , he was a guitarist for local rock band The Heavy Petters , and I couldn ' t take my eyes off him , " said Nickles , 28 . " I used to go to Tramp ' s every Thursday night just to watch him play . He wasn ' t even the most handsome guy in the world , but he just had this mystique , this air of danger about him . He was really exciting . It ' s too bad he ' s not like that anymore . "
