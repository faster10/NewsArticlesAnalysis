Right now some Moline residents are living in fear of attack . " They ' re more concerned about the town ' s economy than public safety , and it ' s obvious Mayor Vaughn is trying to pass the deer carcass off as the result of a ' car accident ' to avoid taking action " , says neighborhood resident Wallace Kanchis . At an open city council meeting Kanchis demanded action . Said Kanchis , " We need protection and we want it now " . According to another resident , Gina Kintner , wolves jumped a 9 foot fence surrounding her yard and carried off her two toy Doberman Pinschers . " They pushed that rear gate open to get out " , said Kintner . Kintner says she is offering a 500 reward to anyone who can kill a wolf .
