" How ' m I supposed to better myself when all these forces are keeping me down ? " Doogan said . " If I don ' t get out from under this debt , I can ' t pay tuition next semester and provide myself with an education . I ' m under serious risk of reverting to living in my parents ' basement , under their totalitarian regime . These dudes are my buddies can ' t they see I ' m the victim of macroeconomic forces I ' m powerless to overcome ? Jeez . "
