" Last Saturday night , a bunch of us were driving around cranking the new Slipknot when Mark popped the tape out and started messing with the radio , " said Rick Eglund , 17 . " I was like , ' Dude , what ' s your problem ? ' He said it was time for WLUP ' s ' Get The Led Out ' and that he never missed it . I told him he was gonna miss it that night . Then , he tried to stop me from putting the tape back into my own stereo . I had to pull over and force him to switch seats with Dan Alberman . "
