Clarence Whitebread , one of the co founders and backers of White Entertainment Television , had this to say when told about the protest : " At WET , we want to show the importance of our heritage . We want our children to know where they came from and why they are important . We want them to respect and honor their culture and to embrace it into their daily lives . Our young , and all viewers , must come to understand why they will be the leaders of tomorrow . It is their destiny to run this country in the future and they must embrace that . "
