Imagine having millions of adoring fans who eagerly rush out and and buy your albums and then pay exorbitant prices for concert tickets to your sold out concerts . Of course , they ' re doing this ' fan thing ' in an effort to enrich your bank account to unimaginable balances . Nice huh ? Well , if you ' re living in New Jersey , the cost of star worship comes high for those that support their musical heroes . The cost is even higher for non fans of rock stars who just might be simple , hard working citizens who don ' t know a guitar from a banjo .
