I was a cub scout and then a boy scout , from the age of eight until my eighteenth birthday . Let me say that I HATED the program . I could not stand how my activities were all monitored and supervised . I thought that I should be able to have fun on campouts , and not study such things as soil erosion and tree grafting . I hated the emphasis and pressure on achieving merit badges and rank . I thought that the importance paid to uniforms and memorizing laws and oaths was a little militaristic and over the top ( and had no redeeming values ) . The worst part about it was the importance that my parents placed upon my rank and position I didn ' t get to go to Six Flags one year with the rest of the family because I hadn ' t earned my Eagle .
