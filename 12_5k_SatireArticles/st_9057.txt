" I have no beef about sausages per se . It ' s just that when Chippolata showed up with his long haired friends wearing frilly shirts , skin tight trousers and way too much bling , I had to ask myself if this proposal related to employment and sausage manufacture , or just some kind of outlandish gay statement of intent for the island . All I ' m saying is that we don ' t want to end up like Brighton that would create havoc in the caravan and camping holiday market , and we really can ' t afford for that to happen because of some publicity seeking sausagist .
