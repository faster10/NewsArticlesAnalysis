" Body fat absorbs toxins , so fat people simply cannot ingest enough bottles of sleeping pills to have any effect , much less stop their hearts , " Reese said . " And slitting one ' s wrists in the bathtub is not an option if you can ' t find a butcher knife thick enough to reach the arteries under your rolls of wrist flab , or can ' t fit into the bathtub in the first place . All the self loathing in the world is not going to help the obese get their meaty index fingers through the trigger guard , nor give them the flexibility to raise the pistol to their head . It ' s heartbreaking . "
