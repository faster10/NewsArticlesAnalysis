" I have no problem listening to ' The Bachelor , ' " said Eagles fan Frank Zanetti , who watched the game from McFadden ' s restaurant near Lincoln Financial Field . " My wife and I watch the show together every week , but it didn ' t really have anything to do with the game and Tony ( Kornheiser ) wouldn ' t stop making jokes about how much better looking he is than ' The Bachelor . ' It really got annoying when ( Brian ) Westbrook was down on the field for a few minutes and we had no idea how badly he was hurt . "
