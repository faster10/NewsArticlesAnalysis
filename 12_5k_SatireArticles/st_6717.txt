" Buttons is so sensitive , I just know she ' s scared and frightened without her Mommy by her side , " Davrian told uninterested relatives Monday , just hours after arriving in Florida . " And Bonkers gets so cranky when he doesn ' t get his morning treats . I hope they ' ll be able to handle this emotionally . I ' ve always gone to great lengths to assure them that they ' re loved , but they ' ve never been left alone this long before . If they think I ' ve abandoned them , I ' d never be able to forgive myself . "
