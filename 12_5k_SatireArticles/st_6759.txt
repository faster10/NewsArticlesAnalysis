" Mr Clinton is a very nice man for saying these things . A very nice man , " Vito Vincenzo said . " Were it up to me , I would just forget the whole thing . But unfortunately it just isn ' t like that . We love Mr Clinton and his beautiful wife Hillary . And that precious little Chelsea is just a doll . It would be tragic if she were to disappear on the way home from school only to turn up several months later in a dumpster in Passaic , New Jersey . That would be a real shame . "
