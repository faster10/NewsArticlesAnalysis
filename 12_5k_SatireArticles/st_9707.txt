Valence had its first big success in 2003 with Methanizer , an air freshener derived from captured landfill gas . It originally had a military application in Afghanistan . The CIA sprayed the aerosolized methane into caves used by the Taliban and al Qaeda . The intent was to either drive them out into the open with the odor or accumulate enough gas in the enclosed space to make it explode with minimal ignition . When the tactic proved ineffective , Valence had to find success in the civilian market place .
