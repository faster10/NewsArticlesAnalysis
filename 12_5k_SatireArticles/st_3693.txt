The film , produced , directed , and independently released by the five time Academy Award nominee , is a bold departure from his signature style of rapid editing , kinetic camera movement , and intricately choreographed tracking shots , instead employing only a single camera on a stationary tripod , with virtually no editing besides brief opening and closing credits . Captivating narratives of moral decay and violent machismo were notably absent , as Scorsese focused on a a simple message of redemption and gratification he hoped would be " real easy for everyone to understand . "
