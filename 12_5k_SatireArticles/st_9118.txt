" It ' s hard working out which one is which . And the ginger bitches play games with the staff . One starts sobbing for her baby , the other starts sobbing for her newspaper and her Uncle Rupert , and when we go to check on them , they clam up . They ' re taking the piss . They ' d be like Siamese twins if they were joined together . It ' s a nightmare dealing with them . With all that reflective ginger hair , staff have to wear welders ' masks before they dare even peek through the spy hole in the cell door . I ' ll be glad to see the back of them . "
