" Characters in the great books may be more allegory than human , but there ' s a lot you can take away from them anyway , " Seward said . " You have to admire the leadership of Captain Ahab as he sets out in search of Moby Dick , or the sense of personal duty and faith in social order that drive Marlow up the Congo to meet Kurtz . Or , in a different vein altogether , you must pity the tragic ugly duckling that is Jane Austen ' s Emma . I know it may be old fashioned to say this , but I think what you read , and how you read it , can say a lot about you . "
