In an attempt to placate PETA advocates , Nabisco , Keebler , Stauffer ' s , and Sunshine proposed replacing the standard zoo animals with imaginary and extinct ones , suggesting that such creatures as the fabled phoenix , the mythical roc , the extinct tyrannosaurus rex and the vanished dodo bird , and the mythological griffin , the hippogriff , the centaur , the lamia , the mermaid , and the satyr take the place of lions , tigers , bears , and other actual animals . PETA called the proposal " asinine , " contending that , " real or imaginary , animals are animals , " and said that it is wrong to promote them as appropriate food or clothing sources . " I wouldn ' t even have a hippogriff as a pet , " a PETA spokesperson said , " whatever a hippogriff is . "
