A large group of nerds and other computer geeks in Lancaster , England have planned a sit in to force their government to also recognize the day . One , named Mark , said that " we are going to attempt to use our Jedi mind tricks and the Force to make Parlaiment give us the holiday . We ' ll also use it ( the Force ) to make people on the street take off their clothes and give us sexual favors , but that isn ' t the important thing here well , maybe it is , since we ' re all virgins ! "
