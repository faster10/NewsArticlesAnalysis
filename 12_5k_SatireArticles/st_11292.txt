" I came up with this idea , because I was thinking about it , and I ' ve got it all figured out , dude if it doesn ' t involve money for Bush or his rich buddies , then Bush ain ' t gonna do Jack about it . But if Satan himself gave Bush money , I ' m sure good old Beelzebub would suddenly become a great friend , and Bush would portray him as a victim of liberal lies about the good ol ' Devil . I mean , this guy has drained money out of the public schools he ' d never dream of sending any of the kids in his family to , he ' s drained money from the seniors who aren ' t wealthy enough to contribute to his campaign , he ' s cut money from pretty much every social program from the people who would just go out and spend it to survive , he completely eliminated any sort of liability for safety violations , after all what good is a corporation to him if they are broke because of a multi million dollar liability settlement against them . Basically if you have just a little bit of money , doesn ' t even have to be enough to survive on , he ' s the kind of guy who will take as much of it as he can from you and the 10s of millions like you , and give it all to his handful of rich buddies , because he knows that his rich buddies will give him money to return the favor .
