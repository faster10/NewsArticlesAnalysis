" I always have to keep telling myself that Justin isn ' t a bad lifter or bro , he ' s just a misinformed one , " said Steve Cook , Fox ' s gym owner . Cook admitted that he guilty of turning up the music in his gym just to drown out the repetitive " scientific " research that Fox would echo to others . " If I had to do all my own research on lifting , and wasn ' t exposed to the knowledge of many gym bros more experienced than myself , I might even share his narrow views . "
