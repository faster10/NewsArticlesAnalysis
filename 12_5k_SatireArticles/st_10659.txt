Mr Baggett , 32 , in a statement filed by his attorney alleges that on Wednesday afternoon he bit down on one of his 12 piece McNugget morsels and instead of McChicken , found a severed big toe . Mr Baggett " thought it was just overcooked , " before spitting out the batter covered toe , at which point he became nauseous . The toe , which was saved and is now part of his evidence against McDonalds , is described in the statement as being large , with a partially painted nail . " I ' m glad I didn ' t order the Chicken Selects , " says Baggett .
