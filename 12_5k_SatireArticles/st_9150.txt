" I ' ve bought some really useless things but nothing like this painting . I collect anything worthless like old calendars , single used skis , stained clothing , movies on Beta tapes , empty perfume bottles and such , " said the full time hoarder . " Although I do a lot of research on antiques I occasionally make a mistake and pay too little for something . Last month we picked up a beautiful Tiffany chandelier for 10 dollars and when I got it home I said " What am I going to do with this thing ? " . I put it out in the garage but I never got to sell it cuz my husband backed the car too far inta the garage and he done smashed it . Other wise I guess I been lucky . I ' m mostly a teapot collector . got me nearly thirty of em . "
