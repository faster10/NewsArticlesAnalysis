" Next week ' s tragedy will no doubt remind me why I took this job , " said Memorial Hospital EMT Kim Paulkins . " There will be no way we could have been prepared for it , but the important thing is that we all act professionally and do our jobs when the unthinkable happens . I ' ll just wish that , if someone has to die , I could have done something to have saved him or her . I ' ll just have to tell myself next week that I did everything I could . "
