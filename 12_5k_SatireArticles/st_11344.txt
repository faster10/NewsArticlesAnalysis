A minor security scare was caused when President Abdul Latif accidentally discharged his hunting rifle in the direction of the dignatories sitting behind him . Fortunately the shot did nothing worse than blow off the toupee of former Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz . Since 2005 Mr Wolfowitz has been CEO of The Iraq Oil Water Gas Electricity Telephone Internet and Air Utility Corp ( IOWGETIA ) , a wholly owned subsidiary of the Carlyle Group . Speaking afterwards , Wolfowitz played the scare down . " Oh that wasn ' t a toupee . My hair is real " .
