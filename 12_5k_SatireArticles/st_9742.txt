To solve the Anti vaxxer problem , Burwell stated that the Obama Administration would put forth a plan to establish a new country to be formed out of the states of Montana , North Dakota , and South Dakota . The country will be named " Memuruland , " which is short for " measles , mumps , and rubella land . " Initially , the plan calls for all children with religious and philosophical objections to vaccinations and their guardians to be relocated to the newly formed country . Naturally , the current citizens of those states will have the opportunity to relocate to other states . Senator Barbara Boxer of California , Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts , Rep . Adam Schiff of California , and Rep . Peter Welch of Vermont have already agreed to co sponsor the required Constitutional amendment in Congress .
