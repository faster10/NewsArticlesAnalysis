" I ' ll try to get Nate to do a bunch of cleaning and stocking before he goes , " Prusher said . " If there ' s no rush in the last hour , I ' m pretty sure I ' ll be fine . There ' ll still be a lot of sweeping and mopping to do , but I ' m gonna get the bucket all set up so all I have to do is add water . If there ' s a rush , I ' ll have to restock the cooler , which sucks . I want to do a good job and all , but I don ' t want to be here all night . It ' ll take 20 minutes just to flip and sanitize the sandwich counter . "
