After the Arizona game in which San Francisco lost when they were stopped on a last second running play to Michael Robinson at the Cardinal 2 yard line , Singletary was asked why the 49 ' ers called that play instead of calling a pass or a run that utilized Frank Gore : " I think Coach Martz thought there would be a cavity inside " , Singletary said . In other words it was Martz ' s call . Martz asked if he felt thrown under the bus by Singletary , surprisingly answered " yes . " But it wasn ' t all bad . " I also feel I needed a little scare in me as well . But mainly I ' m just glad he didn ' t do anything to my car . "
