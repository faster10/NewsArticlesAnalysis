" With so many people dying at once , the funeral industry is poised to surpass the technology and biomedical sectors and become the engine that propels our economy forward , " said economist Gerald Lang , explaining that as more and more boomers die , casket and urn manufacturers will rapidly scale up production and open scores of vast new facilities to meet the surge in demand for their goods . " We can expect job creation to skyrocket as millions are put to work building the mortuaries , mausoleums , and high powered furnaces we ' ll so desperately need . And with every single baby boomer eventually needing to be transported to a morgue , autopsied , and properly discarded , we ' ll see unemployment drop to near record lows . "
