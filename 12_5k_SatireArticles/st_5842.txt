I say this in the piece , but let me say right here : I am more than just a sports guy . If you ' re going to ask me to dress in some bizarre hybrid baseball football basketball hockey horse jockey boxing shorts uniform , you need to cite a really good artistic reason for me doing so . In addition , you really have to give me some sort of dressing room and not ask me to , in essence , strip naked right there in the photo studio ( I was not wearing underwear that day , to get in the true Maxim spirit ) .
