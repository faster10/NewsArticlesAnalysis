Mayor Bloomberg stepped in to further explain , while his chief council calmed himself . " We have looked back through every record of that fated transaction in 1626 , when we gave the Lenape ' s our hard earned twenty four dollars and there is not one piece of evidence that would suggest that the Lenape tribe disclosed this valuable piece of information . We have very strict laws here in the state of New York , which govern real estate transactions like this one . I ' m sure that many of you have bought and sold homes in New York and are quite familiar with these stringent guidelines . These rules were put into place to protect the buyers of property , by knowing exactly what they are getting for their money . "
