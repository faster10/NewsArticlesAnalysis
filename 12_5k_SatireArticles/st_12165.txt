' Well , eh , it wasn ' t a bad thing actually , " said Doc when we caught up with him , " I had just about had it up to here ( points to his elbow ) with the medical profession . Nothing but a bunch of arse holes if you ask me , with all the health and safety issues , human rights , and the ungodly cost of malpractice insurance . . not to mention the long wait with Canadian Health Care , sometimes I had to wait 8 months before a patient would come to see me no future in it , innit , Eh ?
