Mapping the universe , as you may well imagine , is a rigorous task requiring the utmost precision of measurements and calculation . Our adversaries ingeniously place quasars behind large stellar bodies . As the light emitted from the quasars reaches the outer edges of these bodies , it is bent by the gravitational forces produced by the rotation of the aforementioned masses . This produces one , or two , or three , or four , or even more images of the SAME quasar in different locations throughout the galaxy . Obviously , mapping objects that are not actually occupying the space that they appear to be occupying creates serious flaws in the navigation of the universe .
