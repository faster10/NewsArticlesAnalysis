" The George Michael ' s collection is fantastic , " said Stewart . " It captures the essence of disgustingly filthy conditions of the public restrooms that you forget you ' re having sex in the safety of your own home . Michael has an eye for detail right down to the tissue paper plugging the mysterious hole in the stall ' s wall , homosexual graffiti in eclectic urban graphic novel form , depicting various penises of exaggerated sizes in permanent states of arousal , all individually hand drawn by local artisans . And complete with a non function toilet that you cannot help but feel a cop is about to walk in on you at any minute . "
