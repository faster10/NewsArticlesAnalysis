A turducken might be a showy treat , but why put so much work into something no one will really appreciate you for making ? We recommend a simpler variation made from turkey , chicken , and a store bought pie of your choosing . Don ' t worry about neatly fitting the components together , just stick the chicken on the pie , fold the pie in half , and shove it as far as you can into the turkey . Nothing shows your family how much you care like a turkey bleeding blueberry chicken juice .
