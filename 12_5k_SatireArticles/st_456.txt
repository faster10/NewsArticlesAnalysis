" It ' s really sad how little people know about the world around them , " Schloegel said . " Take the recent anthrax attacks , which I saw coming from a mile away . It ' s all laid out in Miller , Engelberg , and Broad ' s Germs : Biological Weapons And America ' s Secret War . In it , the authors make it plain that our government knew about the threat of just such an attack as early as 1991 . But did anybody listen , much less do anything ? Sadly , no . "
