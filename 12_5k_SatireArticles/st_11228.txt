When asked about X Files launching an alien investigation he said he " I am not the least worried as we had already identified all aliens last year and shipped them out to Foreign Affairs , Defence and Pri Minister and Cabinet where they could do no harm " . When queried why the suspected aliens were not reported to Fox Mulder and Scully he replied " because that would have been discrimination " . He then wrapped up the press gallery with " Move along now there is nothing to see here " .
