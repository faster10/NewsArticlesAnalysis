" You see I was just trying to do my civic clubbing responsibility my job . I love going to PURE nightclub in Las Vegas and the thought of it being potentially shut down for money laundering was repulsive . I mean . . . uh , what would I do with myself every evening ? And without my buds Lindsay Lohan and Brittany Spears not being around , I thought the least I could do is occupy my time by servicing a handful of IRS agents last evening . You know : I drop ' theirs ' and they drop their PURE investigation . Besides , everybody has been in my thingy and done the nasty anyway . "
