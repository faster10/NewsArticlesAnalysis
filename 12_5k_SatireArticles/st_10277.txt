The issue was brought to light by a Colorado woman that had contracted a communicable disease from an adult sexual apparatus that had been shipped to her home from an adult Internet store . The woman called the CDC ( Center for Disease Control ) to complain of her illness as there seemed to be no other organization to report the problem to . After looking into the issue , the CDC confirmed the apparatus commonly referred to as a " dildo " had previously been used by that least one other customer and returned to the internet store where it was resold to the unsuspecting woman in Colorado .
