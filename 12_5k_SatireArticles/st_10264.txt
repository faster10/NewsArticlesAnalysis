My detractors ask me about the audacity of my new hope . They say my bold hope is not especially real because it uses only words without cemented meanings . But they would steal nourishing hope from the minds and mouths of our children . My detractors are the thieves of my universally inclusive hope . To keep the hope thieves at bay , it needs a home and where does hope find a home ? I can tell you where hope resides it resides here next to my change garden . I am the exclusive agent of hope and change . I am the farmer of goodness . Everything speaks through me . Any supporter of me is a supporter of goodness , hope , fairness , change , abundance , happiness , virtue , progress and the condition of being glad . Are you ready ? If not , you are divisive and absurd . "
