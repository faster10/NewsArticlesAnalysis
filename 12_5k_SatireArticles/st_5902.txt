" Naturally I am quite pleased to attend my very first Yankees game , a spectacle that my merely adequate standing had until now denied me , " said His Lordship the Duke Chancellor of Arkengarth upon Settle , who often listens to Yankees games on satellite radio while tending to his 683 square mile estate in Wales . " Until now , I have had to satisfy my sporting curiosity in less costly arenas , often hosting three day fox hunts or airplane races upon the grounds of our family estate . But by mortgaging only half my landholdings , I am finally able to see the Yankees play the Red Sox . "
