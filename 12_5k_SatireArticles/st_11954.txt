That may look like a typo to most , but all my friends and family know that I ' m addicted to the spirit of frosh week . Just a few days ago , when I called my good friend Tommy Sheppard to tell him all the cool stuff we did at this years events , he came right out and called me a " Frosh Party Animal . " Tommy ' s the coolest . I met him when I was a frosh in ' 99 . He ' s just one of the many cool friends I have made over the years .
