When asked about Braun ' s impact on the team , Mike Babbitt , a local Brewers fans , said , " I can ' t really speak to the impact he has on the team , I ' m just grateful I get to see him play this year . It would be a shame if we had to watch 50 Brewers games without him . He is just so incredibly manly and athletic . Although , to be fair , my only frame of reference is Prince Fielder . "
