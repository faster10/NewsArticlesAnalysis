As Back and to the Left news always suspected , it was a war based on fear rather than fact . Which sounds a lot like " The War On Terror " really . You can ' t beat terrorism by invading a country where a dude who built a bomb may or may not be living , just like you cant win the " War On Drugs " by locking up addicts . It ' s like using napalm to clean your bathroom . The moulds gone but you haven ' t got a toilet anymore .
