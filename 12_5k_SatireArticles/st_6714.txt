" It is simply unacceptable that many of our brave men and women in uniform have been forced to sit in overcrowded , run down waiting rooms at VA medical facilities throughout the country , and today I ' m here to announce a long overdue addition to the VA system that will make those problems a thing of the past , " said Shinseki , who firmly declared that the VA would spare no expense to provide armed service members with an unparalleled experience while indefinitely awaiting vital medical care . " Our new flagship facility will address the VA system ' s problems head on by ensuring the nation ' s 21 million veterans have access to the best waiting area in the world , where they can repeatedly check their phones or idly watch the clock in pleasant and spacious surroundings .
