Yes , many including , but not limited to , expandable panels e . g . , using concertinaed panels that can expand or retract allowing different amounts of water to be added , this will help put extra thickness around more vulnerable parts of the vehicle , and thinner armor where it can be thinner . Moisture capture is another feature we want to develop the ability to capture moisture ( using off the shelf dehumidifier technology ) out of the ambient air thus allowing the vehicle to make armor ' on the go ' this will mean vehicles can gain armor while approaching a battle scene and loose it during quick dashes to make up ground to avoid situations that happened in Iraq where large battle tanks got left behind we want our battle tanks of the future to keep up this new armor will give them that capability .
