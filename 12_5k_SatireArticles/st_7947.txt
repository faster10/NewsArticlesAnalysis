Programming the power supply can be accomplished by a USB port located within the power supply ' s case , requiring opening the supply , or by the " data " cable from the power supply to the motherboard . This data cable allows , among other things , an " early warning " of an overload or overheat condition before the power supply shuts down altogether . This may sound great , but the data cable also allows changes to the power supply ' s configuration , which could be a dangerous tool for hackers .
