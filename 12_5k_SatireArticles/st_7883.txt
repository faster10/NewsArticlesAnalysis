" Most of the forces in the universe , " said Professor and D Ream lead singer , Brian Cox , " are essentially electromagnetism . Light , heat , microwaves , and so on . You can even show how the forces that bind atoms , the strong and weak nuclear forces , are related to electromagnetism . This is what Einstein was trying to do with gravity . Show it was another face of electromagnetism . What if he was right ? We know now that a strong electromagnetic force can warp space in the same way as gravity . What if the entire universe is nothing more than light ? That would be amazing . "
