As the meeting came to a close , I asked the representative if the intern would be transitioned into a full time position . " No , we practically stole from him . Now , everyone is uncomfortable with him being around the office . I heard he emailed our HR Department to negotiate employment or an ownership in the software . That led to our team researching the possibility of adapting his software for email usage as well as texting . He ' s the best kinda employee , kinda not employee we have ever not hired but definitely fired . "
