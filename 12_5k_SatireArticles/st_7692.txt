" I could be an aid worker for the United Nations , " he mused . " I ' m no Jimmy Carter , but deep down , I ' m a loving person I think could learn to become one , at any rate , if people give me the chance . I could also do volunteer work in the inner cities : manage a soup kitchen , volunteer for Habitat for Humanity , steer people away from drugs and gangs , help them build self esteem , . "
