" We shall begin by making people feel as fearful and as guilty as possible , about enjoying a night out . We have various innovative ideas to make this happen . For example , we shall ask Parliament to pass a law making it mandatory that all pubs , clubs , restaurants and other places frequented by reckless going outers , must have a gruesome and large picture of the damaged internal organs , or dead bodies , of people who have been adversely and tragically affected by going out in the evening in the past , stuck to the front doors of their establishments .
