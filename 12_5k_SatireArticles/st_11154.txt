Roosters have a lot to say , particularly in the presence of other roosters . They use a great deal of conversation when facing the threat of an adversary . It is conjectured that this is an essential part of their conflict behaviour when confronted with a rival . It appears that their conversation often defuses the situation and avoids a fight which might cause serious injury . One of them usually gives up in face of the other ' s rhetoric and leaves the scene . It may be that the quality and strength of a rooster ' s conversation is basic to his status and dominance .
