Fred Nut , wholesaler of oranges and lemons in Folkestone , England , commented , " Fair do . I mean if it ' s like that , well , you ' ve got to do something . It ' s criminal . They ' ve tried it on other stuff , but it didn ' t work . My carrots are still too long and my bananas droop west . Scandal , really . 36 pips is average , they say , but what if the lemon ' s a bit bigger , that ' s what I say . I dunno . "
