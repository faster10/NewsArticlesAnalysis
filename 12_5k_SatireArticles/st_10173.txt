Surprisingly , the initial wave of approximately 6 , 000 Freedom Fighters from the Washington DC area did not have to draw their firearms to overcome the White House security guards . The second wave of over 20 , 000 Freedom Fighters poured into Washington DC from surrounding cities , and also never drew their firearms . The only injury that occurred during the entire operation was when one of the security guards in the White House attempted to fire on the Freedom Fighters . His M 16 rifle malfunctioned , causing him to shoot a fellow security guard in the leg . The M 16 rifle was later determined to be a Chinese made fake .
