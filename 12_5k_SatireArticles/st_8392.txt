The caveat of saying , " All ' s A Okay now , he ' s not a criminal culprit anymore but is now a new man because of A D treatment " is a threadbare loophole these days . Even alcohol and drug treatment counselors concede that less than 5 percent of all people who enter A D treatment ( alcohol and drug treatment ) get any amount of sober and clean time anything over a year , anyhow . Just think of all the celebs , even non celebs , for that matter , who entered A D treatment and a month after leaving the doors of those institutions , were veritable trainwrecks , worse than ever and riding a Ferris wheel around in la la land ?
