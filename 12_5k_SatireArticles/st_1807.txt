" Our prayers go out to the friends and family of Mr Mahaffey , and to Mr Mahaffey himself , " Dean said . " When used responsibly , the Nintendo GameCube is a refreshing and enjoyable way to unwind from the pressures of the day . It is not intended for abuse , as has been reported among a small percentage of our happy GameCube family . We hope Mr Mahaffey can get the help he needs so he can once again lead a productive life that includes responsible playing of such forthcoming games as Dungeons Dragons Heroes , Legend Of Zelda : The Wind Waker , and Evolution Snowboarding .
