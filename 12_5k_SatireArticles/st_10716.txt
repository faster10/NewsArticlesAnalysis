" This is the stuff that gives me headaches and keeps my mail box at ICAQSADCP full everyday " remarked LaMotta . " Why is it no one stops to think about the history of the world and realize human nature is so complex that there are no simple conclusions to draw when senseless violence results in the death of a young person ? I was taught in my Philosophy of Logic class in college that , if something is true , it must be universally true under any and all circumstances . Because of this I ask myself why there are horrible wars with children as young as 3 years old slaughtered daily in central African countries which don ' t have television or video games , for example ? I was also taught in kindergarten not to look for people or situations upon which to blame my problems . If I spilled a glass of juice , I went to get paper towels and the teacher ' s assistance to clean up the mess . I knew at 5 years old my spilling the glass by accident was not a representation of violence against the system instilled in me by playing Space Invaders . "
