As you listen to the full message unfold , it directs you to " press 9 to be placed on our do not call list " or " press 1 " to speak with a customer representative . To be sure , pressing 9 until the cows come home doesn ' t give you a pass from this pack of diligent buzzards because they ' ll call again and again . Complain to the National Do Not Call registry run by our government which states it ' s there to stop this improper behavior ? Good luck with that ! The man made 7 complaints using the FTC ' s own action website and not one was answered !
