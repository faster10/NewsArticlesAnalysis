" He doesn ' t have any other pitches except for the fastball , but we had the guys all take a crack at him and no one could come close to hitting him , so for now he could probably get by with just the one pitch . Although he does have some control problems . He knocked out 6 guys who were sent to the hospital with pretty serious life threatening injuries . On the bright side all of those hit were not going to make the team anyway and were being sent down to the minors , so I guess their tenure here just ended a little early " .
