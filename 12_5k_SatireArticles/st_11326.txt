One charter member of " Klit and Lose It , " a unique weight loss program , isn ' t overly concerned with the science behind klitting . She admits to weighing 400 pounds five years ago . Now she is a self proclaimed success story at just over a quarter of her former bulk . " Please don ' t print my name , but all the fat people of the world deserve to know my secret . When I ' m klitting I forget all about ice cream . In fact I often skip meals completely . It feels like . . . like I ' ve died and gone to heaven , " she gushes .
