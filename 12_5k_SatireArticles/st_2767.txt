Many Mexico fans are protesting Hawaii ' s win , claiming that the U . S . team used controversial and some say illegal tactics to win the game , including removing their best hitter Aaron for a pinch runner after he got on base and then reinserting him into the lineup as a pinch hitter two outs later , and having what appeared to be six outfielders , all of whom moved simultaneously at identical angles and speeds . In addition , during a key play in the second inning , a Hawaii outfielder tricked Mexico baserunner Pancho into trying to stretch a single into a double by simply not picking up the ball .
