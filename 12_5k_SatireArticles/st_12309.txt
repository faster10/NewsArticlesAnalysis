Thanks to the corrupt , agenda driven Department of Justice , led by another radical Harvard buddy of Obama , the New Black Panthers , the NAACP , and other racist groups had the run of many polling places in cities corrupted and ruined by their democratic leaders , who promised much but delivered little , except to their own pockets . And the Dems worried about the GOP suppressing votes ? How bout being threatened with a gun in Detroit , or faced with the Brothers holding billy clubs in Philadelphia refusing entrance to vote to any Republican ?
