" Cockroaches have come a long way since I first created them they ' ve really flourished over the eons and have clearly established themselves as one of earth ' s great creatures , " the Eternal One proclaimed . " I admit , I didn ' t give them much to work with , but look at what they ' ve done with it . There are cockroaches on every continent on the planet in houses , apartments , landfills , forests , deserts everywhere . They are truly remarkable beings . "
