" There is a certain type of torture , which is called al Khaygania so named in honor of its creator , former security director al Khaygani in which the victim is handcuffed and suspended on a piece of wood between two chairs like a chicken , " Saddam said . " Then , we attach an electric wire to the man ' s penis and toes . Can you see Bush doing this ? Can you see Bush smashing a man ' s skull with a brick ? Can you see him calling for the deaths of his own family members ? Pah , he is too weak . "
