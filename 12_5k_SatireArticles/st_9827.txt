" Here is the slant I ' d like to take with the campaign : ' Psycho ' s need guns too to protect themselves . ' Play up the idea that no one has any respect for nutcases but they are human too . They too have feelings . They too are covered by the Second Amendment . Show the human side of themselves . Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris at Columbine were picked on by the jocks . John Holmes at the Batman shootings was rejected from the University and got jilted by his girlfriend . The Sandy Hook kid grew up without a father . The guy who shot Gabriele Gifford lost his job and was considered nuts by everyone because , . well . . . because he really was nuts . We ' ll play up the sympathy angle you can even find something humane about Satan if you try hard enough . "
