Mr Denktash the self proclaimed President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus said : " But it isn ' t even April 1 so this can ' t be a joke . And it ' s really in bad taste . We will need to have a referendum . I may or may not resign depending on the results from a referendum . " His counterpart Mr Papadopoulos said they welcomed the North and connected land mass , however all trade to and from former Turkey would now have to pass through the green line as otherwise it would constitute recognition . He added , " We are always open to reunification . On our terms that is . " UN Secretary General Kofi Annan declined to comment as he was found in a corner of the UN ' s basement in New York sobbing and chewing on pieces of his 9000 pages long Cyprus peace plan .
