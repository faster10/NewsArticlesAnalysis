" 1740 was for the limited edition life size Scooby plush toy with Working Wanker , " wailed Mason . " We waited in line for 2 days ! She insisted that it sleep between us at night . , and I don ' t need to tell you which way his wanker was facing . The 98 was for the Complete Scooby Doo action figure set at FAO Schwartz . She made me wear my baggy pants that day to conceal the goods . Damn that was embarrasing when we got caught . And the 37 ? That patent leather Scooby Doo signed dog collar ! Waaah ! Now I know why she made me wear the collar to bed and say " Scooby Rooby Doo " every time she asked me if I loved her . She never let me shave the hair on my back either . All the clues were there it was sooooo obvious and I am sooooo stupid . And all those damn Scooby Doo marathons we watched on TV . "
