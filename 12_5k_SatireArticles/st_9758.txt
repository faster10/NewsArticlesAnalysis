When pressured to explain if he felt that declaring himself not a scientist could be seen as an attempt to excuse ignoring scientific fact in the name of satisfying the agenda of special interests that have financially supported him , Rubio angrily replied , " When I say I ' m not a scientist it is because I am not a scientist . If you want someone who bases their understanding and decision making on fact then elect that guy , because I ' m not him . Clearly , enough of my constituents believe the way I do things is the right way to do them or I wouldn ' t have gotten elected . If you don ' t like it you can move to a country where their representatives take into account nebulous concepts like scientific method and observation . Me and plenty of other Americans know that this is a special country , and with God on our side everything will always fall in our favor in the end . "
