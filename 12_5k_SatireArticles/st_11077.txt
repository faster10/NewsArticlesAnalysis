" And behold I saw a Lady covered in scarlet seated upon a throne of gold . She came to the hill from which she tooketh her name . Her eyes were like sparrows ' eggs flecked with azure and her laughter maketh the wild jackals run from their lairs into thorny ravines . Behold , I didst see her coming from a distant land in a bird made of metal that gleamed in the sun , and that didst roar like a hundred lions as it flew through the air . And I heard it speak in its own voice of death by drowning , of ropes for chairs and holy gates and how to get to them . It didst roar again as it landed on many wheels that breathed smoke while the obedient it carried in its stomach sang praises of thanks to the Blessed Virgin , her husband and her beloved Son , calling all three by name . Many camels then came to take away the innards of the bird that belonged to the Scarlet Lady . "
