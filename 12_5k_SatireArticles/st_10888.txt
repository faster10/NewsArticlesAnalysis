" I did not received one email back , " said Nwadala Al Homonym . " The British people are so ignorant and rude . I even tried contacting ordinary people , telling them of my woes , and asking if they would invest the money on my behalf . I even offered to let them keep the interest that they would earn on thirty million dollars . I considered this amazingly generous . Not one reply , not even to say no . I am not surprised that there is a recession in the UK . "
