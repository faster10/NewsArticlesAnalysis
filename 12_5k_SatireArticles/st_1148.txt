Despite his harsh words for Mr Paws , Kilmer admitted the kitten ' s lack of cuddliness may have been in part circumstantial . " A kitten benefits from the presence of deep shag rugs that offset its fur color and fish bowls to peer into bewilderedly or bat excitedly , things Mr Paws lacks , " he said . " In addition , there are no beagles on site next to whom Mr Paws can curl up and fall asleep . Now , wouldn ' t that be cute ? "
