The Jets are pretending they don ' t like the Patriots , but really I think they are just pretending . It ' s like when I had a skunk under my deck and every day I ' d spray the hose at it and it would spray its scent at me before I went to work . I ' d always shout at it but really I just wanted it to go away and spray other things or get run over by a car . I didn ' t like being sprayed by a skunk every day when I went into work because you are treated like an animal by your friends and co workers . Marky wore a surgical mask near me except on the air because then they wouldn ' t let him . I think the Patriots will win .
