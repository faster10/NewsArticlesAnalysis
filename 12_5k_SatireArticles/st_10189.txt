While James seems to think playing the music extremely loud and dancing to it on the front porch of his Miami Beach home is perfectly acceptable , such is not the case with his neighbor Annette Garrison . Ms . Garrison ( 56 ) says after hearing the loud music one afternoon as she was tending her garden , she was outraged at the level of noise coming from Mr Duncans house : " The noise was almost unbearable , so much so that I couldn ' t even stay outside . When I asked him Mr Duncan to turn it down he refused saying he was practicing his ' EllieDancing ' and that the music had to be as loud as that to dance to it . "
