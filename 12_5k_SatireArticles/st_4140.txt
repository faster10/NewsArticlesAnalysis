Though most fans agree Yao ' s 22 point , 8 rebound effort against the Bucks was his greatest game , some argue the best was his 21 point , 6 rebound game against Charlotte in 2006 his 22 point , 6 rebound game against the Bulls in 2004 or his 22 point , 7 rebound game against Memphis in 2007 . However , many contend that considering Yao was only two rebounds shy of a double double and had only one blocked shot despite being a foot taller than nearly every player on the court , the Milwaukee game is the performance in which Yao the mere player became Yao the legend .
