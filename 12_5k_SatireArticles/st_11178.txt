On the Home Front , our friends in Westminster London are getting ready to rearrange power sharing in Northern Ireland . Nice try Sinn Fein . . . but , come on ! We did feather your nest for many years , let ' s be fair . And we did tell you that you had free rein . Your city councils are practically nothing now but your reception desks . How many houses , tourist hotels , pubs and rackets do your gallant ' warriors for the people ' own . . . on an " industrial wage " ? ( More laughter ) . How many would you own without ME ?
