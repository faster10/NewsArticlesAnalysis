" In order to reduce the chances of our officers hitting the wrong gunman , we ask that the white hat be securely in place before you leave the house . This rule not intended for " guys " only . We are fully aware that many of our females are gun owners as well . That is why we have purchased an ample supply of white baseball caps for the ladies . They can be picked up , at no charge , from any local police or fire station . "
