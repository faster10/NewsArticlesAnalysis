According to the blog , it states that the woman ' s name is " Li Ling Ling " and that she uses the alias " Bustysingaporean " when modelling . Her photos were supposedly leaked out when her laptop was sent to a computer repair shop in the US . The computer repair technician managed to recover the deleted files and folders and sent them to the blog . Currently , the topless photos are now being circulated like wild fires on pornography websites . Believed these photos were taken by her boyfriend or lover in a hotel . These leaked topless photos are more intimate than the lingerie or bikini photos on the internet . Furthermore , she seem to be very proud with her figure and willing posed nude in my positions for the camera .
