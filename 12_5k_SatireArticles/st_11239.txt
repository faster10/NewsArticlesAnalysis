Animal activists are outraged ( they always are ) about cats being slandered purely because they have muslim owners that don ' t pay parking fines . " There are lots of wonderful cats that don ' t pay their parking fines " , they claimed . However Police were quick to note that Trump had ' declared cats are bad ' and this gave them all due authority to use whatever force necessary to protect society from this malevolent terrorist threat . Further they cited that Census raid where 350 operatives with only a truck load of military weapons had to fend off several hissing cats and that Police often put their lives on the line in the interests of public safety with very little thanks from the public .
