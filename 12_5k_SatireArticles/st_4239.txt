" We must work together to keep scramp out of our schools before our children become just another statistic , " said MASA founder Helen Perry , whose 14 year old son died of scramp related causes in her imagination three months ago and again last week . " Just look at what happened to Tim Kepler , a 17 year old Boise boy who I heard jumped from a radio tower after trying scramp just once . These scramp pushers will stop at nothing to get your child to take their poison , and once they do , your kids are hooked for life . "
