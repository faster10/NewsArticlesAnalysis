" Gross fossil misuse and mismanagement , such as the reckless , irresponsible practice of digging up dinosaur bones and other remains of prehistoric lifeforms for useless , trivial and unproductive display in museums , must not be tolerated , " Oliva said . " Left undisturbed , as intended by nature , such residue of long extinct lifeforms may have eventually matured into valuable deposits of coal and oil . Sadly , though , for the many fossils currently on display in museums or in use in scientific studies , this will never happen . "
