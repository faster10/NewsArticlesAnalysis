" It was when United played Chelsea at Stamford Bridge , " said Scholes . " It ' s an odd name that , isn ' t it , Stamford Bridge . You ' d think they ' d either have a ford , or a bridge , why both ? Surely the bridge replaced the ford . I mean why continue to use a ford if there ' s a bridge there . I never understood that one . And what is a stam , and why would it want to cross a river ? I worked with a Japp Stam , I wonder if it was him . "
