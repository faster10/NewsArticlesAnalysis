" We ' ve been known as a " poison ivy league , " university forever said Dean Bowman . Millionaire ' s , and even billionaire ' s kids who couldn ' t get into Harvard or Princeton traditionally came here , or went to Duke . But they seldom gave us the kind of endowments those schools got . With this new light bulb , we ' re gonna be rich ! You can re name West End " Vanderbilt West " right now ! The Parthenon ? That ' s going to be the new Bower Student Union Building !
