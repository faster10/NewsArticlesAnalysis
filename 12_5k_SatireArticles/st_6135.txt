" We ' re kidding ourselves if we don ' t believe heavy book use is a major problem , " Walters said . " We ' ve all heard horror stories of young people not being able to put down Gravity ' s Rainbow .

And once they ' ve read a gateway publication like High Times , they ' re going to read whatever they want . "
