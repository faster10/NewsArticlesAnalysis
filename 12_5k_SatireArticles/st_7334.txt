" Honestly , I don ' t think being gay is evil , but hey , neither is being a practicing and prolific heterosexual , as Mick and I have been since we ' ve recorded our first hit records . You are what you are . I ' m just an old bass player with an extremely long tongue but I want all my young fans to know that there ' s nothing wrong with being straight . Be strong , be proud , be a bastion for your own heterosexuality . Don ' t hide in some dark closet because you ' re 100 percent straight . "
