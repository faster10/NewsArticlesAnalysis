The proposed promotion would extend to other Hallmark projects , Blank said . " For the Hallmark Channel we plan to show test patterns instead of syrupy , gooey , wholesome movies on a couple of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas we ' re not sure which ones yet . I should say we haven ' t selected the days or the test patterns . But I think the hum accompanying the test patterns will be as popular as such Christmas carols as Granny Got Run Over By A Reindeer , Chestnuts Roasting Over An Open Fire or Silent Night . I also think that our test patterns will be more popular than such specials and movies as Miracle on 34th Street , A Charlie Brown Christmas or It ' s a Wonderful Life . "
