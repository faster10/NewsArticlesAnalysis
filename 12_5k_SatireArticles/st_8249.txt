" I heard this squeaking noise at about quarter to four , " one of the group told Skoob Sports News . " I couldn ' t for the life of me figure out what it was , and one of the lads joked that it was probably Mancini ' s bum . Then we turned the telly on and found out that City were 3 1 down . How we laughed ! It must have been deafening in the stadium . Me and the lads aren ' t all that bothered that they scraped a draw in the end United are still two points clear with a game in hand , and the lads have been there and bought the tee shirt . I just hope Mancini invests in a jar of vaseline , because after a while that squeaking drives you mad . Oh , and don ' t tell anybody you bumped into us , because all proper Mancunians support City , and we ' d hate to bust the myth . "
