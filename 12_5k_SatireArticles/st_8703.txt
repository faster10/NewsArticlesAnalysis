" Ulterior motive ? " Shuttlecock responded when challenged with the new information . " Of course I ' ve got an ulterior motive ! I ' m hoping to go to Barcelona in under two weeks and those lazy bastards at the passport office haven ' t sent the wife her new passport yet . . . and time is running out ! We need to book flights and an apartment ! It ' s about time that useless bint pulled her finger out of Boris Johnson ' s arse and got Anne ' s passport sorted ! I don ' t know about anybody else , but I ' d much rather be sitting outside a cafe on Las Ramblas stuffing me face with Estrella Damm in the sunshine than watching some bunch of silly bastards running about and throwing things in a monsoon . No matter how much they big it up . "
