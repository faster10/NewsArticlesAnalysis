Donald Trump agreed . " Lying is at the heart of every deal ever made . You can ' t have a deal , if you eliminate lying . The truth is boring . The truth is annoying . The truth is for losers . That ' s why I took up professional lying at an early age . I have huge potential when it comes to making up things out of thin air . I am a world class liar and this competition will prove it for the whole world to see . "
