" I have my own little notation system to help me make sense of everything , " Smalley continued . " I add an exclamation point next to especially important items , a question mark next to things I ' m only considering doing , and a star next to things I should do as soon as possible . Next to some of the starred items , I also write ASAP . Or , if it ' s a phone call I need to make , I sometimes draw a little phone . But , if there are too many phone calls , I make a separate ' Phone calls to make ' list . "
