Not every public person is a raving ego maniac . OJ , during his crisis , resisted the temptation to do something . Instead he remained calm , kept quiet , and hit the links . He left his defense in the hands of the professionals . After his acquittal , he kept a low profile . Bill Clinton , during the Monica Lewinsky scandal , employed a similar policy . After his unfortunate attempts at self defense ( He still has to live down his " meaning of the word is ' is ' " statement ) , he quickly regained his senses , and refrained from making an already bad situation any worse . Eventually arch conservative Newt Gingrich was caught with his own secretary , and the conservatives had to shut up about it . So a major crisis was averted .
