" We heard that this may roll on over to Sears , and they may move stuff around their stores to make it even . It offends people when men are caught staring motionless at a Craftsman 230 Piece Silver Metric Mechanic ' s Tool Set but not spending equal time staring at a Singer 100 Stitch Stylist Sewing Machine . It ' s just not FAIR ! Men should know they can sew as well as take motors apart ! If we don ' t tell them this , who will ? "
