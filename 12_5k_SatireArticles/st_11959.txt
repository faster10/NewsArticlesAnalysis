My boss at work , Mr Mervin , tells me that I ' m wasting my vacation time when I sign up for the week of fun at the University , and that I should use my week off to go someplace exotic like Mexico . But he doesn ' t know what it is to be a frosh . He ' s just bitter that he was never college material like me . And why would I spend all that money on airplane tickets , hotel rooms , and travel toiletries , when I can buy a frosh kit for 80 and have the time of my life right here in good old Toronto , Ontario , voted one of the best cities in the world !
