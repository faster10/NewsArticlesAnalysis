However , one politician is vehemently opposed to foreign countries intruding into his country . Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond is disgusted by the outcome of the French election and reckons that the English shouldn ' t get any similar ideas . He said , " I ' ve spent my entire life trying to get independence for Scotland and there is no chance we will surrender our powers back to the English . Trust the French to cave in when another country comes knocking . Italy will probably be next . Europe is risking becoming a laughing stock . Well trust me , Scotland will not be following suit . "
