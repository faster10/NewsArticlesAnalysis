Ronnie Wood claims that they have had difficulties finding a support act for the tour . He said , " We had the idea to tour the Moon a few years ago and we asked Michael Jackson if he fancied it . He was up for it but then he went and snuffed it . It ' s a shame because he always wanted to walk on the Moon . Then we thought about asking Whitney Houston just so we could make loads of ' Houston we have a problem ' jokes . Well thats not going to happen either , for obvious reasons . Recently we asked Bruno Mars , but he doesn ' t seem too keen for some reason . "
