His statements Thursday about an armed Christ , along with many others he ' s made on guns , were swiftly attacked by the Anti Defamation League ( ADL ) , and religious leaders , including Pope Francis who issued a rebuttal from the Vatican . The Pope said Carson ' s statements were " historically inaccurate and specifically that the Jews in biblical times did not have access to firearms . " ADL national director Herbert Leslie said , " Even if Jesus had a sidearm , such as a semiautomatic pistol , he would have run out of bullets quickly . The immense amount of javelins , arrows , rocks , or swords available to the Romans in this era would certainly enforce the totalitarian power of the Roman state . "
