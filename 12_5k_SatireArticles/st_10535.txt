Ron wonders why what used to be worried and wrote about , now seems to be accepted as needful and good . " We live in a culture in which the masses are allowed all manner of hedonistic pleasures , a ' la ' ' Brave New World ' and ' Fahrenheit 451 ' , but have no more freedom of thought and action then those drones did . Homosexuality , casual sex , perversity and drug use of all kinds is winked at , but let any speak a line outside of the conservative liberal mainstream , and wham , they ' re branded as kooks , and quickly ostracized and isolated . " , said Ron . " How ' d that come about without us noticing ? "
