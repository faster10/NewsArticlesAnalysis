We might be on the top of the food chain , but it ' s going to be very lonely not to mention downright scary for all of us homo sapient apes when we ' re the only species on the food chain . And if you ' re the type that considers Bush ' an entrepreneur ' who is just taking part in the benefits of an ' Internet driven , free market economy ' , just ask yourself , " How would you like to have George Bush as a neighbor ? " I mean , did you take a good look at the horrible expressions on those monkey heads ? Did you see that hideous collection of monkey hands ? And if your answer is ' Yes , I wouldn ' t mind this George Bush from London moving into the apartment across the hall ' , well , our answer to you is : " Why don ' t you move to the nearest jungle and live there ? Make sure you take plenty of snacks along , because high up in those trees , you ' ll have to forage for your own food . And while you take up residency in your bamboo hut on top of a palm tree , leave the little monkeys alone . "
