Protests by most of the nations involved have done no good whatsoever , so Olympic teams everywhere must now " crash " train over a 3 4 month period in sports thoroughly obscure to them . Every so often , a new sport is added to the Olympic Games , but this time , standard events have been augmented and diluted in stature by the host country ' s Olympic Committee , which has chosen native Chinese events , mostly for their own amusement and propaganda ! The International Olympic Committee had no choice , but to go along , as the Mao boys were threatening to shut it all down if they didn ' t get their way . Holy Confucius !
