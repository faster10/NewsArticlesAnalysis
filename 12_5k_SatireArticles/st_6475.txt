" It is truly sad to see what could have been an upstanding Christian creature cross over to a life of depravity and abasement , " Pastor Kenneth Boyle , director of the Loaves And Fishes Academy Of Christian Marine Biology , said of the Telia felina . " Just look at its flamboyant bright green and gold coloration . And its hundreds of effeminate tentacles , which sway back and forth temptingly in an effort to lure the spiritually weak . The Bible says that on the fifth day , God filled the oceans with living creatures , but surely this is not what He intended . "
