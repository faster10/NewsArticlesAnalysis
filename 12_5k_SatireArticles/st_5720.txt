" It ' s impossible to say who the original screenwriter was , because the original director , along with most of the people who worked at the studio at that time , has been dead for well over 30 years , " film historian Richard Schickel said of the movie , which has been known variously over the years as The Vengeance , Hearts On Fire , Final Symphony 3D , Arriba , Arriba ! , Finding Billy Harper , Boogly , and Untitled Eric Roberts Project . " Besides , so much has changed since then that the original script would probably be pretty hard to recognize . "
