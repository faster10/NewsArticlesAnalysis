" Isn ' t it interesting that the original KKK was organized in Pulaski , TN , during the winter of 1865 by six former Confederate army officers ? " Carleton , clad in a white robe , remarked to the man . " We gave our society a name adapted from the Greek word kuklos , or ' circle , ' and our activities were directed against the Reconstruction governments and their leaders , both black and white . As a member of such a tradition based organization , how does that make you feel ? Do you think this fact subverts our modern agenda ? "
