By late Tuesday afternoon , Los Angeles had been transformed into an Soviet style Papparazzi state . Armed militia men and women could be seen running down West Beverly Boulevard searching for any evidence of Pitt or Jolie . Several teams scoured LA landfills for joints or liquor bottles that contained DNA evidence of Pitt ' s alleged substance abuse . A flare was sent up outside of an abandoned Blockbusters at approximately 1 PM , signifying a Brangelina sighting , which was later determined to have been a poster for Mr and Mrs Smith .
