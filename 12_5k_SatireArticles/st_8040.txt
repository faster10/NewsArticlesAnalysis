Once infected , and in order to begin its reconstruction of the brain cells , Toxoplasma gondii must first find its way to the host ' s brain . To accomplish this task , T . gondii employs white blood cells to serve as transportation . This is a bold move as white blood cells are normally the primary defence against foreign pathogens . While on route to the brain , the parasite begins to divide asexually in order to advance its spread throughout the host body . Although not yet completely understood , it is presumed that T . gondii is aware that it has infected a " dead end " host as the parasite can only sexually reproduce in the stomach of a cat and performs this act of asexual reproduction to be capable of being shed from its human host in a strategic move to find its way back into a cat ' s digestive system .
