Candy Graham , head cheerleader at Walter Cronkite High School in Independence , Missouri was upset by the lawsuit . " Ewwww ! I mean really ewwwww ! That is sooooo disgusting ! It ' s nasty that some gross old pervert would look at us that way and get sexual ideas . We are dressing up that way to stay cool and so we don ' t get any of our good clothes wet and ruined . We also want the college guys with the nice cars to check us out , but not the weirdos ! "
