The Great Boomer Die Off will have its greatest impact , experts say , in the economic sector . The funeral industry is expected to enjoy a 700 million surge in profits , a result of the inevitable onslaught of lavish , Big Chill themed memorial services . Many industries , however , will likely suffer from the die off , including the manufacturers of sport utility vehicles , home jacuzzis and hair replacement systems . The financial sector will also feel the hit , as it is forced to fill some 400 , 000 high paying stockbroker and corporate banking jobs , held for decades by ex hippies .
