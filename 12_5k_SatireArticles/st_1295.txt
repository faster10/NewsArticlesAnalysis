" I enjoyed the lovely singing during church service , and was very sad to see it go , particularly because I am a lonely septuagenarian waiting to die , " Mabel Graskowsky , 78 , said . " But then Pastor explained to me that there are groups who get together just for singing only , and I could go to any one I wanted whenever I wished . Just singing ! None of that boring inbetween stuff I always slept through . I ' m much happier now . "
