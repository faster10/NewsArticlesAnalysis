Cascadia is nestled in the Pacific Northwest from the redwoods of California and northward to Oregon and Washington , crossing the U . S . border into British Columbia in Canada . The region is a hot bed of independent thought , resistance to the oil and coal industries as well engaging avidly in the un american sport of Soccer . They even have the gall to call their teams FC ' s or Football Clubs . Cascadians also display and wave their blue , white and green Douglas Fir emblazoned flag instead of the U . S . flag . Anne Coulter would be rolling in her grave if she was actually dead .
