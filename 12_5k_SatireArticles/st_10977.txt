" How does the world and the media portray the duck ? A popular liquor is named Cold Duck . Oriental restaurants serve Peking Duck . The guy that does the voice of the AFLAC duck is that annoying Gilbert Gottfried , whose voice you can ' t stand to listen to when he does his stand up comedy . Howard the Duck was one of the biggest box office bombs to come out of Hollywood . While the Marx Brothers ' Duck Soup was a funny movie , the title is derogatory . If we talked about Cold Jew , Peking Negro , Howard the Raghead , or Spic Soup , this problem would have been taken care of a long , long , time ago . "
