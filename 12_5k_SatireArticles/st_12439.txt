" I can just see the proliferation of date nut bread and date bars appearing all over the place . We would , of course , ban these from church pot luck dinners , especially if they were for our youth group or for single adults . It would be even worse if they were brought to a funeral ! I ' d imagine , of course , that people with a sense of humor would bring them instead of the traditional funeral potatoes just to see if they could get the widow to try to make it with the Priest . I also can ' t imagine what would happen if someone brought them to a family reunion ! It would be Arkansas everywhere ! "
