" 2055 is certainly an ambitious target date , but we believe that with dedication and hard work , we can ensure that a deeply troubled young man bursts through a lunar airlock and begins firing indiscriminately at men , women , and children before placing the gun to his own space helmet and taking his own life , " said Project Manager Scott Robles before cautioning that it will take decades to create a lunar society with the proper substandard mental health system to overlook the clear red flags coming from the future mass murderer . " Moving from our current situation , in which we have no permanent presence on the moon , to one in which panicked moon residents gather outside the grisly scene and make frantic , teary eyed phone calls to determine if their loved ones are among the dead simply won ' t happen overnight . But I know this country has what it takes to make this bold vision a reality . "
