He told his campaign advisors that it wouldn ' t be long before everyone saw through his smoke and mirrors tactics and it was vital that they use the WMH during this stage of the campaign . If that didn ' t work he would have to call in the russians as they are the only ones patriotic enough to help out . As for Hillary he had a special role for her once she lost for saying all those nasty things about him . He also said it would be better for America if Obamas name was taken out of the white history books and he would start a doublespeak agency to rewrite history and finance it from disbanding welfare . When asked why welfare he replied " because they smelt funny and didn ' t look right to him and a lot of them are muslims and everyone knows all muslims are terrorists " . When asked about the other minority groups receiving welfare he answered " that he didn ' t ask them to come here and they can go home if they don ' t like his policies " .
