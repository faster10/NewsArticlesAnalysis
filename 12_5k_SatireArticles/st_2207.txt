" See these records ? " said Panziel , pointing to a pile of Herb Alpert LPs . " I don ' t think Grandma even listens to this stuff anymore , but I know that old vinyl can be valuable . If some of these records are worth something , I ' m sure Kent would want us to think carefully about where they end up . But is this copy of ' The Super Bowl Shuffle ' worth keeping ? How about this Amazing Kreskin record ? I don ' t know how to tell . "
