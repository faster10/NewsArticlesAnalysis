Fifth : Use all our old military bases to build nuclear power plants . You can ' t depend on wind or solar power . Sometimes the wind doesn ' t blow and it always gets dark at night , but nuclear fuel just goes on and on . Nevada ' s a big state so storage of spent fuel rods isn ' t a problem and just think about the economic benefits of having a nuclear power plant in your backyard . Not to mention , the closer you are to the reactor the quicker you ' ll get your electricity , not like those poor schmucks outside the danger zone . Some people worry about the effects of a melt down and fallout , but sometimes it can take years for radiation poisoning to kill you . Anyway , Americans should be willing to give theirs and their families lives for freedom from foreign oil . So , in closing , please remember , ask not what your country can do for you because we ' re not planning on doing anything for anyone but ourselves . Thank you and goodnight . "
