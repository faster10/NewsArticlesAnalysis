President William Jefferson Clinton got a " Lewinsky " . Oh , my . I ' m not condoning the President ' s actions or morals when it comes to his marriage , but apparently he was pretty happy and the effect on America was very positive while he was getting some . This , in my mind , and in the mind of many others was not the worse thing that he did , however . He lied about it . He looked right into the American people ' s living rooms and lied about it . This unfortunately turned a lot of Americans against President Clinton , and as a result , the Democratic Party . The Republicans took full advantage of this fiasco and beat it like a dead horse all the way to the 2000 election .
