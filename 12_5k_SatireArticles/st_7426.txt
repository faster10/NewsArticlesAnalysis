Marie recalls when this man came to see her fondly . " He showed up at my home and looked so lost . I don ' t really know if he knew what it was he was doing or what he expected to see or find . Probably some crazy old hag with eyeballs in jars I suspect . laughs I invited him in for some sweet tea and we had a very nice talk . I was so happy when he let me help him with his troubles . "
