The organization W . A . S . P . ( Winos Against Sober People ) wrote a letter expressing " outrage and deep concern " about the recent ill informed remarks made by Phil Robertson . The letter went on to state that " Alcoholism is a disease , it ' s not a choice , and to suggest otherwise is dangerous . " we cannot comment further on this letter since the W . A . S . P . member in charge of mailing it went on a ' bender ' and has not been seen since .
