" Anyone could see when he walked in he was pissed or high on something , and he was in distress too , he said he was wiped out financially after putting all of his money in something called TrumpMarks . I told him I wouldn ' t serve him any alcohol but he could have coffee or anything else on the menu . He started demanding a chocolate milk like it was going to cause a stir , so I told him I would be happy to make him a hot chocolate and meanwhile I signaled Mr J to call the police . "
