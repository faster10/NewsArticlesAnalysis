" Back before Carol became a lawyer and I graduated from business school , Dylan ' s words were our religion , " Washburn explained as he clutched a CD that he just purchased along with his tall no whip half caf vanilla latte . " It ' s just so cool to be able to relive that again . The Starbucks people really understand our generation . "
