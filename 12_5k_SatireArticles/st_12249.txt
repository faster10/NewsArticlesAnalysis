Elizabeth ' Pocohantos ' Warren has been in the news recently after a discovery was made that she claimed ' Indian heritage ' on job submission forms to a school in Pennsylvania , and later on at Harvard . In both cases her ' minority status ' precluded other candidates from receiving a job offer . Warren says she is 1 132th American Indian , but cannot furnish proof other than saying , " My mother told me and I always played an Indian girl with my brother when we played cowboys and indians as children . " Other recent revelations that she suppported the Cleveland Indians has soured election chances in a predominatly Boston Red Sox team base like Boston .
