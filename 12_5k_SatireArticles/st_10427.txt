Satan has been mired in scandal throughout His career as a trial lawyer and later , CEO and President of a large but questionable organization , in which he oversaw temptations and major contract deals . In , Eve v . The Management of The Garden of Eden , Satan was credited with Adam and Eve ' s being cast out into the world , penniless and humiliated by their previous landlord , while Satan received a king ' s ransom in earthly goods as payment for services . Later in Jesus Christ v . Satan , there was wide spread speculation that Satan tried to bribe the Son of God with his ill gotten booty . Satan was cleared of the charges , claiming in court documents that it was not a bribe , but a perfectly legal temptation , that Jesus immediately refused . But his career never recovered the scandal , and He went into the private sector to work for ENRON as Chief Council to Kenneth Lay , the now defunct former CEO of ENRON .
