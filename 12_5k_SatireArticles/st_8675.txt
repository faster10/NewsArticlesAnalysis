" Take my bus , " said Cynthia , " if it ever arrives . It used to be every twenty minutes , now it ' s once an hour . There ' s more people who need to use the bus , as they can ' t afford to run a car any more , but there ' s less buses . How does that work ? I ' ll tell you how that works . Those people who can ' t get on a bus sit on the comfy seat and surf the free WiFi and wait an hour for the next bus . "
