" About twenty minutes after the Trump caravan refueled at my convenience store this lowrider limo came up and I thought they needed some help , directions or something you know , no one was coming out . When I stepped out to the Limo two guys jumped out and grabbed me and said they were sending me home , but I told them I live here now with my wife and children . They kept yelling " anchor babies " at me , I never heard this expression before , you know , I thought they were threatening to drown my children so I did what they told me and I hid under the bar when they drove into Mexico .
