During one sitting at a New York restaurant , the governor ate : two plates of spaghetti Bolognese a sandwich made with salami , provolone , mozzarella , pickles and hot peppers followed by a bowl of pasta fagioli with cheese , and a bit of antipasto from someone else ' s plate . He looked wilted and somewhat dizzy when he stood , but was not taken away in an ambulance . He had ordered cannoli to go for dessert , presumably to eat later , or maybe away from the cameras .
