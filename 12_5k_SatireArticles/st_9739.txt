Roger Aisles was asked if he shared Mr Murdoch ' s opinion , " We refer to politicians as our unpaid extras . It ' s not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing with them , it ' s a matter of finding the best way to generate interest and profit from them . " Mr Aisles continued , " In a lot of ways democrats are our greatest contributors , because it is easy to take something they say and get our customers riled up about it . Controversy sells , especially in the short term . "
