When asked if there weren ' t other options that would make less hardship for the people of the country , Finance Minister Ab Solut Ripoff stated . " We considered many other possibilities , but they all involved us , the financial wizards , having to go out and get real jobs work where we might actually have to really do something , jobs where we would possibly get our hands dirty . Of course we can ' t let that happen . It ' s much easier to let the little people who already have their hands dirty get them just a little dirtier and to be a little poorer . "
