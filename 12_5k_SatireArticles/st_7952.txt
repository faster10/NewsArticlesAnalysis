Kell may indeed see hundreds of incidents at once should someone become irate after losing their job or failing a test , for example . In our opinion , just one incident of smoke or fire should trigger an investigation . We find it unbelievable that Kell doesn ' t see the potential for a lawsuit if one of their computers causes a fire . It would be very difficult to prove that a virus caused the fire after the fact , since the hard drive would be damaged beyond reading by normal means . An electronics engineer comments " They should have had a switch inside the power supply that locks the voltage and the current limit . Although I ' m no programmer , I think it should have been trivial to only allow the internal USB port to change the voltages . There ' s no reason to be able to change those on the fly , other than to overclock the processor . I feel that a person who ' s overclocking is already tampering , so I don ' t think they ' d mind flipping a switch inside the computer in order to do it . For the current products , I think a software update , however complicated , is in order , if not a full blown recall of the computers using this power supply . "
