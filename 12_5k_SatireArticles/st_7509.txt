" My thought process was that this design needed to be completely self contained and biodegradable . To that end , the Crowostomy Bag never needs cleaning or emptying . Rather , once the leaf based pouch has received enough waste , it sends a text message to your cell phone letting you know it ' s ready to be detached from the hemp tubing and added to your backyard compost heap . Benefit ? Well , get back to me after you harvest next year ' s vegetable garden ! "
