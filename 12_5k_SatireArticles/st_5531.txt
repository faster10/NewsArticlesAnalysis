" You have sex , you wear a condom , " said Ellis , who has practiced proper condom use alone in his bedroom . " At least that ' s what everybody says . I certainly wouldn ' t know from experience because , clearly , I ' m a freak . I ' m one of the pathetic 18 percent who still haven ' t even seen , much less touched , a naked breast . Well , rest assured : When and if I ever get the chance to have sex , I will definitely know how to put on a condom . "
