SPEARS : Hell , y ' all got it wrong again ! It was Paris who came beggin ' at my door like the mangy whippet dog she is . She ' s payin ' ME for the photo ops ! Just to let you in on a li ' l secret , that family ain ' t got no money to speak of . Those hotels have been losin ' dough quicker ' n Oprah Winfrey if she was forced to run , non stop , in a humongous hamster wheel for a week without food ! Real estate ' s down the toilet , so the Hiltons ain ' t makin ' any headlines there , either . Practically broke , Paris tells me . That ' s why they been pimpin ' her out the last few years .
