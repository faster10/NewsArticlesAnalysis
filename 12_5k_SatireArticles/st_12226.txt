Elaine McClain told friends and TV interviewers that she and her husband were " afraid due to the online linking of her address to Zimmerman . " We ' re keeping everything locked , " she said . McClain added that the couple was particularly unnerved by a letter mailed to them at their home . On the envelope , she said , were printed the words " Taste The Rainbow , " the slogan for Skittles .
