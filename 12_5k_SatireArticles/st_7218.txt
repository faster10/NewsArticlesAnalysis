" While we believe that no employee deserves ' reasonable accommodation ' , we will follow the order of the court , " someone wrote for the company ' s CEO to read aloud . " We will reaffirm our desire not to get sued anymore by you people , so , as soon as you people stop bringing your stupid dogs into our offices , we will find a way to accommodate your particular retardation , not only at our tax preparation offices in San Antonio , where the complaint originated , but in our 47 remaining offices , and at our Bank , now with one ( 1 ) convenient location nationwide .
