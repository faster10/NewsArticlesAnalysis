At the time of the find , Buck Showalter and general manager Dan Duquette were standing on the first base side of the Oriole infield discussing the team ' s starting pitching woes while the grounds crew was working to get the field in shape for opening day . Suddenly the head of the ground ' s crew started harping on one particular subordinate , which lasted until he called the subordinate a " big worthless fur ball " . The subordinate , who happened to be Big Foot , picked up a lingering baseball and winged it at his superior sending him flying across left field and into the seventh row of the left field seats giving his superior a nasty hang nail on his right index finger .
