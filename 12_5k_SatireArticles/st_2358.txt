" Cults are ruthless , " Hurley said . " They ' ll often resort to such techniques as isolation , suppression of individuality , and brainwashing to indoctrinate innocents into total domination by the cult . Here at the Fellowship House , we provide such people with an environment totally different from their previous surroundings , so that they may better reject their sinful ways of the past , and give over their hearts and minds completely to Jesus , that they may better learn his doctrines and teachings .
