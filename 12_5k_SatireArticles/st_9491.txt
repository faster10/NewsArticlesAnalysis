Both men and women are mistrustful of men who make their interest in their hair obvious , says Harvard psychologist Mark Weiland . " Even today it ' s not socially acceptable for men to demonstrate vanity in that way , " he says . " Men are supposed to be unconcerned about their physical appearance , particularly with respect to their hair . A real man doesn ' t get his hair styled he gets it cut , preferably at a barber shop , not a hair salon . Even with the rise of men ' s grooming products , skin creams , and cosmetics , the great middle of America still believes personal styling is a woman ' s thing . "
