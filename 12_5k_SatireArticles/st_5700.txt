" We ' ve begun administering an aggressive course of chemotherapy drugs and are putting the robot through daily radiotherapy sessions to see how it responds to the treatment , because we figured , you know , that seemed like a pretty logical thing to do at this point , " said Cruise , noting that while the robot ' s condition continues to decline , monitoring its reaction to concentrated doses of toxic radiation " might be one of those things that pays off somewhere down the line . " " Meanwhile , we ' re also applying for additional funding in order to someday replicate our findings in other robots by giving them cancer , and maybe some other diseases too . That ' s the type of thing we usually do during projects like this , so I guess we ' ll try that and see how it goes . Can ' t hurt . "
