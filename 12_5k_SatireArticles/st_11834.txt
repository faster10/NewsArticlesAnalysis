It can be lonely during the holidays . Trimming the tree alone , RSVP ing solo for your cousin ' s holiday party , and practicing your whipping all by your lonesome . But finally , the Krampusnacht rolls around , and I am reminded of the true reason for the season . Oh , to see the faces of the little ones light up , usually from horror , as I burst into their homes and single them out for penance . Ah ! The screams of the children . It sustains me . That , and hot yoga .
