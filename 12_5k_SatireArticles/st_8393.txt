Anyhow , how many celebrities go into treatment on their own because they know they are sick and want to get well ? Very few , and most go kicking and screaming into A D treatment centers because a judge , their wives and kids , or because public opinion says they need to go into treatment because they ' ve turned into diseased monsters . Like the Rolling Stones ' guitarist Keith Richards once said , " I ' ve never had a problem with drugs . I ' ve had problems with the police . " And even hardcore drug abuse has its good points . " Drugs have taught an entire generation of American kids the metric system , " said P . J . O ' Rourke , who was the liberal editor of National Lampoon magazine in the 60s , when he was a young huckster , and now , has gone on to bigger and better things , like being a right wing political pundit . P . J . ' s even writing books these days .
