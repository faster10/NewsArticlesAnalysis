When asked if anything else led to the downfall of their marriage , Katie said that " his desire for me to wear a strap on all the time was a little wierd . I also thought it was funny when he wanted me to use Rogaine to try to develop more chest and back hair and not shave my armpits or legs . I also didn ' t like it when he called me by his favorite nickname : Butch . These things , however , were just couples stuff and really had nothing to do with the end of our marriage . "
