" He ' s crazy , man , " says Pete Hamletshend , Saunders ' cousin . " He really goes through a lot of pain carrying those bags , man . I had to take him to the hospital one time . He severed his finger man , cause those little plastic loops were wrapped around his fingers and one of his fingers just fell off . I noticed he was walking with this maniacal grimace , and then I saw he was bleeding all over the place . And , you know , he wouldn ' t stop . He just kept walking . Dude . "
