Kiss to unlock avoids the problems of Wink to unlock by using the touch screen in much the same way as Lick to unlock . The main difference is that it displays a selected photograph and it is necessary to plant a kiss on the correct part of the screen to unlock the device . The downside of this is that should you leave your phone unlocked somewhere , you may come back to find the photo of your loved one puckering has been replaced by the genitals of a warthog on your now locked device .
