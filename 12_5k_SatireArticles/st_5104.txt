" John Paul II has riffed on everything from the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition to the treatment of Jews and blacks , " actor Bob Newhart said . " He ' s always had a unique ability to come at things in an unexpected way . I saw him last year on TV , talking about those molestation scandals . His main message was that Catholics shouldn ' t lose faith in the clergy . Hilarious ! Now , I would ' ve gone straight to some kind of apology to the victims , but I guess that ' s why he ' s the pope . "
