When asked why the bar ' s managers and bar tenders allow Flatulence to stay , he responded : " I tell them that I am here for just a few drinks and that if they kick me out I am going to have all 50 of my cousins , brothers , sisters , aunts and uncles , who all fart worse than I do , come visit the bar one at a time every single day of the week and stay until closing . Geez , I only never stay for more than an hour , and there is plenty of room for everyone to crunch up in on the other side of the bar " .
