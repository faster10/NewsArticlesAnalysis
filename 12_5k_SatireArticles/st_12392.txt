Secretary of the Treasury , Tim Geithner , said the President is still unsure what to do with the ' revenue enhancement windfall ' achieved with the turn in , but that some of the money may go toward paying down the Chinese debt , some may go to a new ' green ' startup of a solar powered golf cart company which will be taking over the defunct Fisker plant in Maryland , which the president says will employ over 45 , 000 new employees plus the hiring of over 9m union workers currently on ' disability ' for middle management marketing and community organizing positions .
