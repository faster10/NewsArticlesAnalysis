Let ' s all take a moment to bow our heads in prayer , " she wisecracks under her breath as she leads us toward the en suite bathroom to witness the piece de resistance , a gold chandelier above the ornate , double wide 16 jet jacuzzi bathtub complete with pure gold fixtures . Unable to hold her sarcasm any longer , Ms . Showbottom announces , " apparently , Jacuzzi bathtubs were all the rage in pre war New York ( hmphrump , snizzle , wheeze ) . "
