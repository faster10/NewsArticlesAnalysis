" It was nothing , " said a modest Mrs O ' Brian Sanchez . " I just felt like dancing . Don ' t get me wrong or nothing . I wasn ' t being disrespectful or anything . You see my father , he ' s Irish and mother is Puerto Rican and when there was a funeral to attend in our family , he would throw an Irish Wake . By the time anyone knew it , everybody was drinking and dancing , all having a real good time , you know . "
