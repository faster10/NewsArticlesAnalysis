Detective Corleone then said , " This is the third call we ' ve gotten tonight . I don ' t know how to tell you this , but Ikea has been selling evil teddy bears . " He then got up , went to the baby ' s room , and returned holding the three foot tall bear . He placed the teddy bear on the floor , took out a pocket knife , and slit open the bear ' s chest . " There , " he said triumphantly . The Smiths looked inside the cavity , and recoiled . Buried inside the stuffing was the beating heart of a chameleon . " I ' m going to have to take this teddy bear with me , for your own safety , " Detective Corleone said . Mrs Smith started sobbing .
