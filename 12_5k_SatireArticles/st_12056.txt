Senator Barney Frank , a long time weiner supporter and advocate , was pleased by the news . " I ' m glad Anthony found a place . I wanted to put him on my staff , but didn ' t know if it would get bad publicity . He was a loyal and trusted member of Congress before his minor problems . When I needed Weiner help , I always knew I could turn to him . He ' d always be right behind me , supporting me all the way . "
