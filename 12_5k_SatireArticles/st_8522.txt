" The main problem with baseball and football is that if you get a ball into the crowd , you ' re probably never going to get it back , " said a spokesperson for this new sport . " The new sport we have designed allows for much cheaper play , greatly cutting the costs needed for equipment , media coverage and crowd control . The great thing , too , is that the sport still retains all the energy from baseball and concentrates it into a 5x5 metre field . It ' s essentially a storm in a teacup . "
