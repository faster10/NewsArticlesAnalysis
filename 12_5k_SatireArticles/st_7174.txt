" Very soon Americans will pass on their mortgages to their children just like their family values , " said Mr Payne . " Carrying on their parents debt like they carry on their coveted family traditions . Rich traditions too like grandma ' s recipes for brownies , grandpa ' s fabled double chin or antidotal tales that regale the family during the holidays . Lovingly imparted and passed down generation after generation , while all are gathered around the warmth of a fireplace . Stories like the one about the time grandpa drank so much eggnog he really screwed the pooch and let the economy tank on his watch . "
