Seventh Inning StretchLet ' s have a big round of applause for Attorney General John Ashcroft , who is on hand to sing " Let The Eagle Soar " for this sold out crowd . And just as the song reaches a crescendo look ! a real bald eagle has been released to fly over the stadium . It ' s a beautiful sight , full of patriotic pride , especially when the eagle drops what looks like a ten ton bomb of bird shit on Ashcroft ' s head . The national symbol is immediately attacked by the FBI with stun guns and taken to an undisclosed country for torturing I mean , questioning .
