There is an estimated 600 trillion life forms like the ones that created the display with that YouTube dog who are part of young stars . Since all 600 trillion such life forms have not made that type of display it ' s possible that the display could have been part of a test of a new type of technology . They most likely wanted to brag to humanity that they were successful in developing their new technologies . Life forms at that low stage of evolution would never allow us to develop similar technologies at our current stage , but maybe they would allow our decedents 3 million years from now to develop that particular type of technology because they know that 3 million years from now humanity would be more responsible because of a higher form of intelligence .
