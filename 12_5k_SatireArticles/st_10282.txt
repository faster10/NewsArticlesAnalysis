In a letter to the DNC , Clinton attorney Louis Cypher called on the organization to enforce the rules that most benefit Clinton and " make sure that all the votes we tell you to count ( and only the votes we tell you to count ) are counted . Every vote counts . Or at least every vote for Clinton counts . Or at least they count now , despite what we said back in November . That was then , this is now , and it is a woman ' s prerogative to change her mind . "
