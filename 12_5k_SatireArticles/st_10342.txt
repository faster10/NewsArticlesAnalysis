As Election day nears and unrest escalates , peasants have been warned by Sir Robert that they may have only a short time left before they once more " disappear " at the polls . The Sheriff of Halliburton , who has ruled the land since the king went on a Crusade , responded forcefully , calling Sir Robert an " alarmist " and " a rotten spoil sport " . Halliburton is reportedly up in arms at the anarchist ' s claims that peasants who are likely to vote " negatively " may turn up at the polling booth to find they no longer exist or worse .
