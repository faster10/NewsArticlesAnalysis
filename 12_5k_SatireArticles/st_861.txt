" Bisquick is just another one of these Silicon Valley behemoths that moves in and totally changes the community and not for the better , " said local resident Peter Watson , who noted that the land used for Bisquick ' s indoor rock climbing wall used to be open park space that the city sold to help attract the company . " When I moved here in the ' 80s , it was all students and families now , my whole street is nothing but Bisquick millionaires in their electric cars and luxury penthouses . "
