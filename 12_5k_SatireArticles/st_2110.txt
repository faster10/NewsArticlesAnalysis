" Old ? Are you kidding ? Everything we sell here at TransUniverse goes straight to collectors with no middlemen the day we make it , because these Trekkie types insist on buying the items the first day they ' re out , " TransUniverse co founder Wayne Spoerl said . " We don ' t need to wait for it to become a collector ' s item over time we just print the words ' Collector ' s Item ' right on the package . They ' re valuable because we only make a limited run of , say , 500 , 000 . Okay , more , but still . "
