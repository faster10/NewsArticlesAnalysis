Melvin has gotten his squad into several embarrassing scrapes thus far , one of which occurred at Willow Lake when , in an effort to find a place to nap , he twirled around three times while still in full harness , fouling his lines and entangling his team in multiple snarls . In addition , as the team was on route to Skwentna , a child spectator threw an imaginary stick over the team , and Melvin chased it 300 miles back to the first checkpoint at Yentna Station .
