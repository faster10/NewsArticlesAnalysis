He said he was asking both sides to observe the Holy festival of Ashoura by cooperating in a spirit of bipartisanship and goodwill : " Both the Faithful and the Infidels should cooperate to ensure that religious services and municipal services work harmoniously together to serve the public good , God willing . These facilities should not be occupied by the American invaders of our Islamic Republic after the manner in which they have unlawfully occupied the lands of the Faithful , but nor should any Moslem deny any man access to the path of contemplation on the nature of God , for it is written in Holy Qoran that he must put on his right shoe first in the morning , and he should heed the words of the prophet , for that is the first step on a man ' s journey towards contemplation of the infinite . "
