" A couple of weeks ago , I was at the bar Brendan and I used to go to all the time , " Nickles said . " I ran into Rob , the bassist for Brendan ' s old band and , I have to tell you , he looked really good . We hung out and talked for hours and just had a great time . Drinking and laughing with him really reminded me of the way it used to be with Brendan . I think I ' m developing a little crush on Rob . "
