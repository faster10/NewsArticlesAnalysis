" Anyway , the assholeness of machines rubs off on their users . It ' s like hanging around a pessimist all the time . Sooner or later , you ' ll think less highly of things you ' ve got to blend into your surroundings , after all . Now our high tech world is chockfull of computerized bastards and sons of bitches . We ' re standing neck deep in them . Our work chains us to them . We carry them in our pockets and on our belts and soon we ' ll be wearing them for glasses and we ' ll bury them under our skin . We ' ll have little asshole nanomachines swimming through our veins .
