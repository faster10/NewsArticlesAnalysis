The fat reserves , estimated to hold 230 billion gallons of excess U . S . lipids , adipose tissue and cellulite , have now been packed into triple hulled steel tanks at up to four times standard pressure , seriously threatening the structural integrity of the system . Federal fat management personnel , using computer flab flow monitoring systems , project that the reserves will suffer at least one major rupture in the next three months . Further , almost all of the tanks have experienced overflow conditions ranging from minor lard seepage to explosive catastrophic weld failure .
