Alex Ferguson said he was proud to be the boss of Tevez and that his techniques of applying make up for Tevez did help . " I use my bubble gum in sticking the various number of creams , grind the whole thing , spit on it and apply the mixture slowly on his face until it becomes sparkling white . That ' s the same reason why even Ronaldo stopped diving around these days . I ' m sticking my gum to his shoes . But he ' s a hard worker and am sure he ' ll be his usual self soon . Coming back to Tevez , I ' m once again proud to be his gaffer . "
