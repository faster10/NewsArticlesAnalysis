According to reports , the 44th president of the United States gazed longingly into the distance before heading off in pursuit of the stallion , stumbling barefoot through a maze of magnolia trees and into an overgrown oak grove , guided only by the full moon and an occasional ghostly whinnying up ahead . Every time he caught sight of the pale figure , it would reportedly disappear further into the shadow drenched recesses of the garden , eventually cantering off through a thicket of brambles and onto the South Lawn .
