" I was out in the woods searching for herbs when I saw him sunning himself on a rock by a small spring . Normally , diamondbacks are very leery of humans and are quick to let one know they are somewhere they do not belong , but this time was different . He didn ' t rattle , puff himself up , or anything like that . I felt the same calm , friendly feeling I felt around other snakes only this was much deeper , as if we were connected . "
