Santa regrets that he may have to put a drug policy in place for employees . " I ' ve always trusted my elves , to do the right thing . So I ' ve never addressed the issue officially . We had one incident a couple of years ago , where the reindeer were doing beer runs for some of the elves , but nothing like this . I just can ' t have elves under the influence , operating the toy cart . It ' s just too risky . "
