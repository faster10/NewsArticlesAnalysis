Dr Alan Nolan , a biophysicist at Drexel University who has led research efforts into the puzzling phenomenon , told reporters that systematic observation and data analysis have failed to adequately explain how the subject could possibly fit into size 32 jeans mere moments after comfortably wearing a pair of size 33 khakis . According to Nolan , a broad array of hypotheses , ranging from Holland wearing a belt with the size 33s to Holland ingesting a large quantity of food or drink between putting on the size 32 and 33 pants , have all been ruled out , leaving the research team at a complete loss .
