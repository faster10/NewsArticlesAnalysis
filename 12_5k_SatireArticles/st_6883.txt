" When I was in line waiting to get my Farscape David Kemper autograph card signed by David Kemper , there was this chick talking to me for the entire hour , " said Brisbois , who said he would rate Osley " 7 or 8 " if he saw her on Hotornot . com . " She was from Oklahoma and really into Quantum Leap . She also knew a lot about Final Fantasy games . I was about to make a move , but then some other guy walked up and gave her a free copy of his fanzine , and suddenly it was as if I ' d been transported to another galaxy . Damn , that chick was cold . "
