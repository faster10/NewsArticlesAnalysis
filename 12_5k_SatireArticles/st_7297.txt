For the most part , though , celebs are a very sick bunch . You have to have some serious problems , when you crave validation by millions of anonymous strangers . Let ' s face it , that ' s what it ' s about . The money is never enough . Madonna could retire to her manor house , in the English country side , to live out her days pleasantly , in peace and quiet . Instead , she ' s made a spectacle of her self by mounting the cross , in mock crucifixion , during her most recent concert tour . This time no one was shocked , or even amused . People were only mildly disgusted . Oh how the mighty have fallen . Egomania , however , can be a truly tragic condition , for fame is very much like becoming the stiff at your own funeral .
