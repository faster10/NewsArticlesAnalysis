By LIZ CHENEY " Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction . We didn ' t pass it on to our children in the bloodstream . The only way they can inherit the freedom we have known is if we fight for it , protect it , defend it and then hand it to them with the well taught lessons of how they in their lifetime must do the same . And if you and I don ' t do this , then you and I may well spend our sunset years telling our children and our children ' s children what it once was like in America when men were free . " Ronald Reagan , March 30 , 1961
