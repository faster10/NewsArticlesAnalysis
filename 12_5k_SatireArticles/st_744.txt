" The bottom line is that kids here are always going to throw dinner parties , " said Mark Halsey , associate dean of Bard College . " No matter how hard we crack down , students will still find a way to get fresh produce from the local farmer ' s market and make a big garden salad or puree some root vegetables . Some of them may even whip out Apples to Apples after dinner and play that while sipping on some limoncello . All we can do is try to make sure it doesn ' t get out of hand . "
