So far Core have kept Lara localised within their offices , but she has expressed her desires to explore the world in order to find herself . She says " although in Tomb Raider I have been all over the world , experiencing new and exciting things , I know that none of it was real . I want to explore the world for myself and become a new woman . Maybe in the future I ' ll become a TV chat show host , I like Jerry Springer , he kicks ass "
