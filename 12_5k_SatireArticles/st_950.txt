" It is impossible to deny the similarities between Parliament ' s Regulation Of Depository Institutions Act and our own S . 576 , the Financial Regulatory Reform Bill , " said Sen . Phil Gramm ( R TX ) , sponsor of the U . S . bill . " For example , Section 102 of our bill repeals the limitation on the authority of a bank to permit the owner of any deposit or account to make withdrawals by negotiable or transferable instruments for transfers to third parties . Lines 404 410 in the British bill are almost identical , right down to the words ' transferable instruments . ' That ' s my phrase . "
