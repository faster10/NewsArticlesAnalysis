The drunk and stoned Rose challenged Kurt Cobain to a fight during the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards . Cobain reportedly sent Rose to the mat with a single left jab , but felt so guilty he later commited suicide . Speaking perhaps of Cobain , Rose said , " There ' s one guy I won ' t be able to make amends to , at least not in this lifetime . I just hope that he ' s somehow able to forgive me . " As for the riots Rose caused , " A public apology is about the best I can do . "
