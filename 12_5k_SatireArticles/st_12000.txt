Luckily for sports fans , the Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers had moved their stadiums and conservative fan base to Boise , Idaho , and Iowa City , Iowa . Said Wack Job Raider ' s Owner Al Davis , " well , attendance is down out here in the sticks , but at least I have a team to screw around with ! That ' s more than Commissar Obama can say after losing half his constituency , Nancy Pelosi , Barbara Boxer , Diane Feinstein and all his union slush fund money ! "
