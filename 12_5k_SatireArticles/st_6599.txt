" This is an absolutely historic day for American money after years of fighting and struggling , our government has finally declared that U . S . cash , irrespective of amount , can no longer be barred from the American electoral system , " said University of Pennsylvania historian Dr James Mattis , who argued that , while the goal took decades to achieve and at points appeared bleak particularly during the repressive McCain Feingold years few could deny that suffrage for all U . S . capital was inevitable . " This has been a long time coming , and we can now say with certainty that the fight to ensure that every single American dollar has a say in our government is finally over . Now , at long last , all U . S . money has a voice in Washington a strong , loud , clear voice that can no longer be suppressed or silenced by anyone . "
