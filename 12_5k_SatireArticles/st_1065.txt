" The administration should be encouraging research into viable new technologies , " said Sylvia Hermann , chairman of Advocates For Cleaner Burning Fauna . " The energy produced by solar generators could be used to incinerate vast herds of moose , even in the coldest winter months . Wind produced electricity could electrocute Beluga whales in their own habitats , with no need for offshore drilling , and hydroelectric dams could be used to drown grizzly bears . Perhaps one day geothermic heat could be harnessed to broil entire wildlife rich regions alive . "
