When you start refusing to be friends with someone , refusing to hire someone , or refusing to speak to someone just because of something they said or did , you put pressure on them to change the way they express themselves , simply to protect your own feelings . The danger is , even the strongest of thinkers , like myself , will crack under the pressure and become less likely to talk about these subjects and I think we can agree that my talking less is the biggest danger a free society could face .
