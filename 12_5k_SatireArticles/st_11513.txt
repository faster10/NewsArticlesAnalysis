Julian Assange is the voice of the free world and he went to Sweden to seek protection against those who wanted to silence him , but little did he suspect that those same persecutors would use two female double agents as a method to imprison him . His persecutors knew that Julian Assange was not a criminal and they could never entrap him , so they used the operatives to make false accusations which can ' t be proven , but which can land a man in jail or prison . The persecution of Assange is the persecution of every man in this world who could get framed by a feminist or a female operative , even though a man has committed no physical crime against such women . Assange is not alone because 70 percent of the male population around the world is behind him 100 percent because they understand his plight and the lies that women tell .
