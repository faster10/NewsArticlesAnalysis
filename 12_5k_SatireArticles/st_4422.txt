Jack Holm , designer of the website , believes nature lovers will find it superior to the real parks in every way . " You will experience the same grand mountains , lush grass and wide variety of fauna , without ever leaving your home , " he said . " And when you spot an animal on your cyber tour , like a majestic elk , you can click on the elk and access information about its habitat and diet . Elks in the wild do not offer this option . "
