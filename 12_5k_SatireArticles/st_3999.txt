" One of our lunar rovers captured an image of God at approximately 2100 hours last night , and we immediately launched a vessel manned by our best assassins , " said Richard Egan , Mission Control Chief at the Johnson Space Center in Houston . " After exiting the lunar lander , the astronauts approached God under the false pretense of peace , but He must have sensed something was amiss and fled . Our men gave chase in a moon buggy , finally overtaking Him in a crater where He was subdued after several minutes of violent hand to hand combat . "
