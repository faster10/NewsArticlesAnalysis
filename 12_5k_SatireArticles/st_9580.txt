The Hulk was joined by Thor ' s " sensitive " brother Loki and even Captain America , who while not gay issued the challenge , " Call me a butt pirate , futermukers , and see what you get ! " In an epic comic book showdown , they squared off against the Fantastic Four joined by Dr Strange fighting for polygamy rights , " just not the gay kind " . As the mortals ran for the hills , super heroes and villains alike realigned themselves according to sexual orientation . The battle lasted for days , destroying most of the state which was intellectually running on fumes anyway . Ironman Tony Stark took no side since he was just there to watch .
