" When I heard who would be moving next door , I thought to myself , ' Hanson ? Isn ' t that a Swedish name ? ' It sounded sort of Scandinavian to me , " Schukal said . " But now I know that there ' s no reason to judge people by such arbitrary categories . To me , the Hansons , and for that matter everyone living here in Glencoe , are more than just German Americans , Anglo Americans , Italian Americans , or even Swedish Americans . What ' s important is to see past all that and realize that , deep down , we ' re all just white Americans . "
