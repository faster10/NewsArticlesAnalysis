" Personally , " said Amelia Toffee Nosed , a close friend of Pippa ' s , " I don ' t think Harry is her type at all . For a start he ' s a redhead , and Pippa has always said that she ' d rather get a rash down below than date a redhead , and I know for a fact that ' s true . I think she got a rash off a redhead and it ' s put her off . Also , she ' s not really into all that Hitler Nazi stuff , you know saluting and gassing people for a laugh . So no , I don ' t think they ' ll get together . "
