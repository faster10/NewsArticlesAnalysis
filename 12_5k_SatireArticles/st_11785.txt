His children are walking proof that there is no substitute for the finest ingredients . Just as we use only the freshest , organically grown ingredients in small , finely honed batches , so Daniel ' s son and daughter were made with the best genetic material available , and not born into some synthetic , watery , factory made childhood . Sandra , you should be so proud : you both together have made well balanced , quaffable children that would stand strongly against any of the fine independent offerings available at any tasting or festival .
