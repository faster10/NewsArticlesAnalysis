" Those first few years after college , there were times when I was going out drinking with my friends three or four nights a week , " Bingham said . " The low point probably came when I woke up on the couch at my friend ' s apartment with my coat over me as a blanket . I could barely even remember what had happened the night before . Then I realized I must ' ve fallen asleep while we were drinking beer and watching Fletch . Kinda scary when you think about it . "
