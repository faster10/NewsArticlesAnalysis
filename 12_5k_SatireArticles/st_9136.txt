Another reporter asked Mr Quirky if the title My Trip To Venus was somehow misleading , despite his denials . Mr Quirky replied , " I never thought I should have to print a disclaimer at the beginning of that book , or any of my other books . Everyone knows I am a fiction writer , and everyone knows that no human has ever been to that planet . I mean , how much more do I have to do to convince the public that I have always been a fiction writer , and do not aspire to anything else . Booksellers list my books under fiction , and book reviewers have always considered my writings to be fictional . There was never any attempt on my part to present my writings any other way . "
