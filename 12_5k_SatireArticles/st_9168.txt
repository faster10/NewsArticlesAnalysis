Smith said diversity is about including people of all races , genders , sexual orientations and life experiences and views . " Surrounding God with people who think as He does and perhaps parrot what He says isn ' t conducive to good religion . I don ' t care if you ' re meeting any kind of metric at all , the point is to have people at the table who will be willing to contradict and lay out perhaps more challenging ideas . I think that God needs to be challenged . "
