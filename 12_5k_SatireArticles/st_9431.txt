A Senate aide , who insisted on staying anonymous , said , " It ' s not big news right now . Thank goodness it happened when it did . The Senator ' s where he needs to be . We hear he ' s settling in well at Sundog and there are many other old war vets in there that he ' s taken a liking to . They seem to like him , too he really can be a charmer and a friendly guy . But the other residents keep telling him he fought in Vietnam , not the Revolutionary War . For some strange reason , the Senator adamantly argues that he fought at Valley Forge and the Battle of Bunker Hill . . . .
