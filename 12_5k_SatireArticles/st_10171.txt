Former Governor and now Presidential candidate Mitt Romney has come under fire for admitting that during a trip from Boston to Ontario in 1983 he only had room in the car for his five boys so he tied his beaver to the roof for the long ride . The former Governor could be facing charges of cruelty to his beaver if he returns to the state . The beaver lost control of its bodily functions on the trip and was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis , although no connection has been made between the two .
