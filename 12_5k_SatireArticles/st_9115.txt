" I ' ll probably stop at about ten rooms , " Shuttlecock told reporters . " You know , once I ' ve done the underground office , the living space , the sauna , the kitchen , the office , the 32 seat cinema , the music studio and the wet room . That should be enough . I ' ll be proper underground by the time I ' ve dug that lot out . I expect it ' ll take about a month to get it all up and running . I ' ll probably make one of the rooms up to look like a cave . I ' ve always wanted a cave of me own , ever since I was a little lad . "
