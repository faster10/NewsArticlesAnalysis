Oh , I don ' t know , maybe a certain mister Alexander Keith , another freemason , who had the bright ' idea ' to start ' a brewery ' in a university town ' ? And is it a coincidence that brewery ' is a word with nine letters , if you add the letters " P and " S , which stand for PHILOSOPHER ' S STONE ? That ' s right , the mythological ' stone that can make any man , or should I say freemason , immortal ?
