In recent months the President has been less vocal about gun control . " Why doesn ' t he run his mouth more ? I mean , this should be a great time to come against the gun lobby . But he just lets the NRA roll over him and the Senate Democrats . He ' s a push over now . If he would just do more complaining about guns , and more complaining about the NRA , his media lackeys would do our work for us . But as it is , gun sales are flat . It ' s almost as if no one believes anything Obama says ! " explains NRA spokesperson Trey Musket here in Washington .
