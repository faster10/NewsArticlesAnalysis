" When Piggy took the kids away from him two years ago , it took Kermit only a month to get hooked on that ( heroin ) . While he was on the stuff , he was in constant denial of the life that he made for himself . He didn ' t want to be " that frog from Sesame Street " anymore . He wanted to be a Caribbean amphibian , but it was just all just screwed up . We tried interventions and rehab . Rehab worked for a while , but Kermit just couldn ' t be turned . After a while , all his friends gave up on him which was probably the final nail in the coffin . I ' ll miss him , but he ' s in a better place now . He was a good frog . "
