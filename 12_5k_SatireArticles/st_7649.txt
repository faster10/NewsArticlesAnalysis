New Yorkers need not fear a late or cold pizza with Spiderman on the job , although this may be the first time that Dominic ' s Pizza ' can justify the delivery of pizzas with sticky white goo all over them without being sued . The only word of warning from the former hero ' s new employers is to avoid retrieving suspended pizza boxes from the centre of a spider web , as victims ' a . k . a customers could become fatally ensnared , for which Dominic ' s accepts no responsibility .
