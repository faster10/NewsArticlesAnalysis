In fact the owner of the house had remarked upon a most interesting phenomenon which occurred when he first used the central heating unit . He found that when he used his ' gramophone ' the audio could not only be heard from the horn or speaker , in that the light bulbs would also seem to be ringing out with the audio and the wire filaments in them appear to vibrate ' mostly unusually ' . Practical Wireless , a publication still in existence today , ran a couple of articles on it and put forward their own theories . In short they concluded that introducing RF energy into the mains wiring was bound to have the wiring act as an antenna , the audio from the record was leaking as a result of the fluctuations in the magnetic field of the speaker or horn which modulated the RF signal in the mains wiring of the wireless or gramophone , and that the junctions in the light bulbs were causing the signal on the mains to be ' rectified ' and so the the audible effects noticed with both the filament and possibly at the same time the glass envelope could be vibrating , giving the audio tones the distinctive ' ringing ' note .
