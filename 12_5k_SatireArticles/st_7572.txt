" We also hear tell from all the local ladies down at the beauty shop that she didn ' t even have a baby shower . Erlene McCoy ' s been makin ' her peach cobbler and takin ' it to every baby shower in these parts fer nigh on fifty years . Ma Hatfield ' s been quiltin ' them baby blankets of hers since dirt . Eunice Johnson been makin ' cradles and cribs forever with the help of the Bates girls ( they wittle out the poles since the arthiritis has got Eunice a hurtin ' somethin ' fearful ) . Aggie Turner always donates a mason jar of her shine so ' s they can have somethin ' to dip the pacifier in when the baby starts teethin ' . This girl ain ' t even got the decency ta let the local ladies take care a ' her . "
