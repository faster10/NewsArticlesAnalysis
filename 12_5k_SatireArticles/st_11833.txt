Each year I am shocked anew at the commercialism of the Christmas . This Fall I was in my local Costco stocking up on bulk cranberry juice , when I saw they were using " Christmas to sell everything , even toiletries and large bags of potato chips . Mein Gott ! For a moment , I wanted to lash the store clerks then and there . But no , the Krampus only whips small , terrified children , to force them to atone for their year ' s evil deeds . No store clerks , I ' m afraid !
