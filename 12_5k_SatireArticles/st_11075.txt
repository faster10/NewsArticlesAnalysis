Ezekiel had previously prophesied that God would come and seat Himself on the throne in the rebuilt Temple of Solomon on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem . The Desert Fathers of the seventh century , under the influence of magic mushrooms , made a connection between this event and the Theotokos or " Gate to Heaven " ie , The Virgin Mary . This latest finding would seem to corroborate this view , although some distinction must be drawn between God and his Mother , and how exactly they get along . And indeed , if either of them are on speaking terms with the Anti Christ .
