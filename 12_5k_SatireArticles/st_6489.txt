The media have rallied in support of Downey , pledging airtime , magazine and newspaper coverage , and even Internet links in their effort to keep him under constant watch . Entertainment Tonight dug deep into its file footage archives to air several profiles on Downey . USA Today has run six stories about the volatile actor in the past three weeks . And , in perhaps the most impressive gesture of support yet , Fox has offered Downey a recurring role on Ally McBeal , stepping in with budgetary allocations and casting resources to make sure he can be monitored by at least 15 million Americans a week .
