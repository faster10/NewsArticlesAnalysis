" I ' m convinced he has everything written down somewhere , " said Michael Cueva , another longtime friend . " Last summer he told me he couldn ' t come to my barbecue because he had to fix a leak in his roof . I ' d completely forgotten about it until three months later , when I finally saw him at his place and he pointed to this random part of the ceiling , talking about how he ' d patched the leak , sanded the surface , and carefully matched the paint color so well you couldn ' t even tell it had ever happened . Ingenious stuff . "
