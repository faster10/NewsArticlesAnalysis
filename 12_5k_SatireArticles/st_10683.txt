WASHINGTON . May 9 . President George W . Bush and his wife Laura flew back to Washington on Monday from an exhausting , and by all accounts , marginally successful series of meetings and ceremonies throughout Eastern Europe and Russia . The entire trip was completed ( almost ) without a hitch , until the President tried to pickup his luggage at the Air Force 1 Carousel at Andrews Air Force Base . His bags were evidently not on the plane . Mrs Bush ' s luggage made it without any problems .
