" I got the casino figured out , " Drake said . " If I don ' t win at a machine in the first 15 minutes , I know that slot is cold , so I move to another one . But if I do hit , I know that one ' s hot , so I ' ll sit there for eight , nine hours , until I need to get back to the bus again . Or until I run out of money . Oh , and I always use a warm coin .
