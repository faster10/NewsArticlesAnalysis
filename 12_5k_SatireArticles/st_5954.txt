" We provide a stimulating and inspiring classroom environment that empowers children to develop their personalities and become strong , independent minded individuals , " AMLC instructor Ellen Driscoll said . " The Montessori method rejects the traditional teacher student relationship , in which the teacher is in control and the student passively accepts knowledge . Instead , the teacher serves as a guide who enhances a child ' s learning ability by appealing to their creativity and recognizing their individual talents . The child learns by doing things herself . "
