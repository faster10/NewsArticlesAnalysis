" There are five types of supernovas , " O ' Neal said . " I told Steve that if I have to endure one of the five , I would prefer the Type 1c , which has weak or no helium lines and no strong silicon absorption features near 615 nanometers . The worst would be the Type 1b , which is characterized by non ionized helium . I made it perfectly clear that , with all that I ' ve done for this league , a neutrino heavy Type 2L is simply unacceptable . "
