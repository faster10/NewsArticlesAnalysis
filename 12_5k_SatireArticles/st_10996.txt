A new fad , however , has left experts scratching their heads . It is now popular among teenagers to communicate with single character texts . In an interview with middle school student Ian Jacobs , he explained how conversations with his girlfriend are restricted to 100 characters or less . " Teachers are always watching us , to make sure that we ' re not texting , so we found it best to keep texts as short as possible , " Ian explained . At first blush , the idea of a single character text such as " a " may sound absurd , but Ian described that he and his girlfriend have a special code that they use to communicate . For example , " g " means " good morning , how are you ? " while " i " means " i ' m fine , thanks for asking ! "
