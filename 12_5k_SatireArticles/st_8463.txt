You can now picture the scene . ' Bodge up ' Spurs sack big Martin , and get Jose . He might have an ego the size of Oz , but could anyone realistically see the best manager in the world at the Lane ? I think Mourinho ' s Chelsea departure has set a cataclysmic chain reaction around the world of football with the start being Bernd Schuster ' s possible sacking at Real . Why not ? Capello was sacked for having the temerity to revive Becks career and win the Primera Liga ! Next up is big Phil , who ' s Portugal national team contract ends with Euro 2008 . I think this may be a tad to early for Jose . Then there ' s Soho . Had it not been for the emergence of Heskey as a giant in the game , we could have had Brian Barwick and the men in white coats beating a path to the Mourinho pad . Then there ' s Barca , Inter and whisper it ! Could he replace Ranieri for the second time in his career by taking over the affairs of the ' Old Lady ? ' Another interesting factor will be the reaction of senior players , Terry , Lampard , Makelele and Drogba who has made it clear the Jose is the reason for him staying . This is where Avram Grant will have to earn his corn can a good cop number 2 step into the breach of club enforcer ? I say no and the best current example is Sammy lee at Bolton .
