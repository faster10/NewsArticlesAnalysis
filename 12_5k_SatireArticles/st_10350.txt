" It ' s something I always wanted to do , " says Mrs Bush . " I could never do these things when I lived in the White House and I can ' t stand a house that is in any way physically , mentally or spiritually , dirty . Now maybe I can finally stop watching my weight , wearing uncomfortable shoes and do something meaningful like have my own Tupperware party . Tupperware , in case there is anyone out there who does not already know , is fantastic for both freezing and warming humble pies . "
