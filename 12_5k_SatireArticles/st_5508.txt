" I knew right then he was working an angle , " Parker said . " He knew it hurt me to retire without that one last big score . But I wasn ' t about to get up out of my chaise lounge . The realty game cost me my health and a couple of perfectly good marriages . I wasn ' t about to go back to that . So I tell Sneaky Pete I ' m retired , and that there ain ' t enough commission in the world , and that he can get off my property , thank you very much , and who ever heard of a three bedroom four baths on a prime piece of Hamilton County property for just 237 , 851 , anyway ? But he just smiles and throws a picture of a house in my lap . "
