Several minor offences have been committed by Cribbies as of late , leaving one to wonder if they have gone power mad . A spokesman for Lothian and Borders Police said that at a recent court appearance of Cribbies in Edinburgh ' s Sheriff ' s Court , disrespect for the law was made clear as the baby gangsters entered , bouncing ballies , carrying musical potties that blasted rap music with some wearing their jim jammies as it was nearing their bedtime . When , during questioning , Cribby members were put in booster seats they cried out " goo goo , yo yo yo , mon , whaddup ? ? " in their pre gangster slang , flashed their gang signs and engaging in member only handshakes of patty cakes and generally causing constant disruptions . Others just laid on the floor , sleepy eyed , sucking the teats of their milk bottles , belching and spitting up . It was concluded by the court that the Cribbies are nothing but colicky sprogs on the road to becoming dangerous gangsters , but too cute to prosecute . That is until their little bald heads grow enough hair for dreadlocks .
