Over the years , he built up a reputation for his measured , calculated approach to typing , rarely slipping below his average typing speed of 772 words per minute ( he did once slip to 771 but that ' s because he had to type the word , " hippopotomous " within that particular minute . The article in question was entitled " BMW Staff Member ' s Favourite Animals " )
