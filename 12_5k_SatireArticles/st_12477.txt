When asked if there was a specific program in mind that would be funded by the new lottery tax ( many states , for example , but a large share of their lottery funds into education and college lottery scholarships ) , a spokesman for the Obama Administration said that " since the lottery is fun and is considered a game , we think that the money we receive should be targeted to the same general area . These new monies will be spent on paying for the President ' s much needed golfing holidays and 100 million dollar family vacations to Africa . "
