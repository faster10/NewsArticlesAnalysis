The one fact I do know is that when Jian would have a woman over , he ' d grab my ears which by the way aren ' t even that big , but nicknames stick , don ' t they pick me up , and turn me to face the wall . And sure , sometimes it would sound like his guests seem confused about why they were there . Sometimes it sounded like he might have been creepy or overly aggressive . Sometimes it sounded like the date was being choked to the point of not breathing , or being struck with a closed fist . But at the end of the day , I didn ' t see what happened , and neither did you . So let ' s not start dialing up the drama just yet , shall we ?
