Except for that one morbidly obese vampire lesbian I saw . She could stand to miss a few blood lettings . Honestly , how much blood do you have to suck to get that fat ? I didn ' t even know there was fat in blood until I saw her rolling around in a Rascal scooter ! I ' m no paranormal physician , but I think she had vampire gout , or at least their equivalent of type 2 diabetes . Also , she had the most armpit hair out of the lot of them , which is really saying something .
