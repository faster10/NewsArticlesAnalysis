The second part of the current debate is over " high capacity magazines capable of holding more than 10 rounds in the magazine . As experts in military weapons of all types , it is our considered opinion that reducing magazine capacity from 30 rounds to 10 rounds will only require an additional 6 8 seconds to change two empty 10 round magazines with full magazines . Would an increase of 6 8 seconds make any real difference to the outcome in a mass shooting incident ? In our opinion it would not . Outlawing such " high capacity magazines would , however , outlaw a class of firearms that are " in common use . As such this would be in contravention to the opinion expressed by the U . S . Supreme Court recent decisions .
