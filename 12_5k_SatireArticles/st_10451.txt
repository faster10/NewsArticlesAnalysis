During the time that the airplane was coming in to the Pentagon , there was a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President , " The plane is 50 miles out . " " The plane is 30 miles out . " And when it got down to " the plane is 10 miles out , " the young man also said to the Vice President , " Do the orders still stand ? " And the Vice President turned and whipped his neck around and said , " Of course the orders still stand . Have you heard anything to the contrary ? "
