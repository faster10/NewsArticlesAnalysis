Its brightest four moons are easily visible through back yard telescopes as are its cloud bands and even the large eye shaped red spot first discovered by Galileo . Do not confuse it with the much brighter Venus which appears in the west right after sunset and also appears like the brightest star like object in the sky in third place behind the sun and the moon . Saturn is almost straight overhead at sunset and is dimmer than Jupiter . Its rings are easily seen though telescopes as small as 50mm in diameter visible also is its giant moon Titan which also suffers from gas problems . Titan will appear like a small star always near the planet .
