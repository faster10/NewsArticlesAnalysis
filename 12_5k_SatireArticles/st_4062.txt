" If a presidential candidate sighs during a debate , is that good or bad ? " said office manager April Cook , adding that she feels as though media outlets like CNN , Forbes , and every cable and network news program in the country should generate " at least 10 times as many " body language stories as they are currently producing . " Could bad body language affect voters ' perception of the candidates ? Does it help , during a debate , to appear presidential ? I ' ve read 300 articles about George Bush checking his watch during a 1992 debate . Should he not have done that because it made him look disengaged ? I simply won ' t know until I read more about it . "
