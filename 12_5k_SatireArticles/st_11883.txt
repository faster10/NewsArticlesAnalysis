That Grenfell Campus has the only bachelors of Fine Arts program in Newfoundland and I ' ll be damned if you ' re going to disgrace your papa ' s memory by running off to study Interpretive Dance ? I don ' t care if it ' s been your dream since you were six , he didn ' t work 25 years on a fishing boat , god rest his soul , for you to wear tights and prance around in the prissified city of Corner Brook ! My only child , my own flesh and blood !
