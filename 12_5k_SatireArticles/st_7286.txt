One of Bristow ' s biggest fans , a shady east end mechanic called Clint Denton , had this to say after his eviction from the jungle . " What a facking liberty ! I ' d put a mankey on ' im tawin . That Ant ' n ' Dec need to watch their facking norf and soufs . Fackin ' norvern ponces . Takin ' the piss out is Hobson ' s choice . Cant ' s ! Do wan me ol china , I ' ve got a cortina needs clockin ' . "
