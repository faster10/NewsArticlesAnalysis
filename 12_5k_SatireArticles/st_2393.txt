" Back in college , when I was screwing with reasonable regularity , I ' d actually spend time thinking about the subject of safe sex , " Tudor said . " I ' d worry if carrying a condom in my purse was being too forward . I ' d think , is it okay to have sex with friends ? What sort of stuff do I want to explore ? Are threesomes safe ? I had no idea that one day , my safe sex questions would boil down to , ' Where can I get some ? ' "
