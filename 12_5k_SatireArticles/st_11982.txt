Once long ago , deep in the doldrums of the failures of the Boston Red Sox , I sat in a box seat one afternoon . Not far from me , alone , sat Bill Russell . He was always a fan of sports like baseball . In those days there were few people of color on the Red Sox , and Russell stayed for the entire game . When we were heading out , after a loss , I was behind him , unable to catch up to speak to him . He was in the midst of a quiet crowd , tall and imperious , the only black person it seemed to me at Fenway Park . No one spoke to him , and no one asked for his autograph . The all white crowd around him was silent too , perhaps depressed by another Red Sox loss . But , Bill Russell seemed especially solitary in his thoughts . I wanted to tell him I was delighted that he came out to support the Red Sox , but I never had the opportunity .
