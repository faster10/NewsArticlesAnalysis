Yesterday I caught my boyfriend reading through my texts , emails , and Facebook messages . When I asked him what he was doing , he replied with , Necessary boyfriend surveillance ' and asked me who Nick was . I had texted Nick twice in the last four months . We have a class together and I needed some clarification on an assignment , but my boyfriend said that if he caught me talking to that douchebag again , it was over . We ' ve been dating for three weeks . Is he being too overprotective ?
