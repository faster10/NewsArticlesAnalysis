" Once , " told recording engineer , Axel Cable , " Prince made me listen to about an hour of this one dove , just pining away . It almost sounded human after a while . When I asked Prince what the bird was crying about , he told me that the bird was broken hearted . . . . and , that he was responsible . When I asked him what he ' d done , he just looked at me with this hollow stare and told me , ' I have my ways . '
