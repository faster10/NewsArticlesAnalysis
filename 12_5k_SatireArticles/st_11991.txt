Six sailors went down with the demolished remnants of the ship when the Frank was attacked by a German submarine June 19 , 1942 . There were 18 survivors who managed to survive by treading water until 1965 . Their luck changed when a discarded shipment of balsa wood logs floated their way . An impromptu raft was quickly lashed together helping the sailors to survive until this past week when the Sea Scouts heard them singing in a fog bank . The Scout leader , Milton Krebs , decribed the survivors spirits as ' a little bit pissed off ! '
