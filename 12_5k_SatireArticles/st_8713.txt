" It is impossible to get thirty children out of the pool , showered , changed into clothing and out at the fire point in the car park in the requisite five minutes , " said Herbert Nosbury , Fire Safety officer for Dorking and Dorking West . " As this is impossible , I have had no choice but to close the classes down . Additionally , there was far too much water in there , which forms a clear and present danger of drowning . Especially with children around . "
