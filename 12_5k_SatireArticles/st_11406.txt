Ultimately this fun loving lifestyle is the context in which we should view the Faeroe Islands , we should switch focus away from their government ' s leveraged purchase of Rupert Murdoch ' s media empire , Fiat , the island of Cyprus , Abraham Lincoln ' s tomb and the undisclosed contents of what is believed to be an alien crash site off the coast of Ecuador . After all , everything is fine , FINE . FINE . FINE . As the Faroese say " YOUR LIFE IS ASHES . "
