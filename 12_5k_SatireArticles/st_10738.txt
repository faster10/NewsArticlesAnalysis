When Chloe Wilson , a 37 year old single mother of six received Polinsky ' s message it also felt different . " I don ' t usually do older guys , but in this case it just felt right . Besides I needed money for beer and lottery tickets and he looked like a good mark . " Wilson also had one photo left of her father that she clung to . It was given to her by her mother who had drawn a Hitler mustache on it and curses on the face so it made sense that she didn ' t recognize Polinsky ' s attachment .
