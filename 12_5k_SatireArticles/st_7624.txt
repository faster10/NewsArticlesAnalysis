Reaction within the gay community has been mixed . Representatives from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) provided positive feedback following the release , stating , " You go girl ! " While critics , including the Bisexual Organization for Ordinary Transsexual Youth ( BOOTY ) , have denounced both Ernie and Berth for waiting nearly 30 years to come out . ' BOOTY spokesperson , Gary Laquita ' Brown said , " I could understand if their gayness was clear , like Siegfried Roy , or like Rosie O ' Donnell , or like Tom Cruise . But they were both acting all macho butch , acting all hetero , not for a few months or a few years , but for 30 damn years . What ' s to hide ? Don ' t hide it honey cause I won ' t ! That ' s why we at BOOTY say those bitches are weak ! Ah ' kay ? ! "
