" The best and worst thing about Jefferson is that there ' s always something going on , " Allard said . " When you need to work on a bill or practice a speech , there are no quiet places to do it . I go to the study lounge , because that ' s what it ' s for , but there ' s usually people talking in there . For a while , I tried working in my room , but there ' d always be a bunch of people sitting in the hallway right outside my door debating term limits or playing euchre or whatever . "
