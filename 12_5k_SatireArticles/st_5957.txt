So I toss the kid back his strange little ball , and the teacher says to him , ' What do you say to the man , Jeffrey ? ' The kid looks up at me and says , ' Merci beaucoup . ' Then the teacher says , ' Or . . . ' and the kid says , ' Danke schoen . ' Then the teacher says , ' Or . . . ' again , and the kid says , ' Domo arigato . ' Then they walk off . "
