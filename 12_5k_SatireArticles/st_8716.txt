Pointing an accusing finger at the Prime Minister Sir PG then asked , ' How can there ever be enough money in circulation to achieve it with this system ? It means even more money from that bank ' s printing press has to be borrowed in order to pay off the instalments , adding even more interest to the bill . Taxpayers are not only being mugged , they ' re also being treated as mugs . The only way the debt could ever be repaid would be to allow everyone to do the same as the Bank of England and create it out of thin air as well . Why is it illegal for members of the public to print off their own tenners and fifties but perfectly legal for the Bank of England to do so ? Why is it a criminal offence in this country for people to free themselves from debt by printing their own money ? In short , what ' s going on Prime Minister ? '
