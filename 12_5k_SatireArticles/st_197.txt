" Back in ' 89 , I was stationed on Madison Avenue , between 53rd and 54th , " said veteran Gene Meacham , who served with Saatchi Saatchi from 1988 to 1991 . " It was horrible . People were getting laid off left and right . One morning , I walked into the office , and Roger , my copywriting partner on the ' Just For The Taste Of It ' campaign , was gone , his desk completely cleaned out . He was fired in the blink of an eye . I was late for a strategy meeting . I didn ' t even have time to grieve . "
