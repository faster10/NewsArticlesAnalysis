Celebrity and author James Kirkwood , famous son of former silent film star , Lila Lee , told me much of the true story behind the shooting death of his mother ' s lover at a Manhattan Beach mansion . Acting as his literary confidante , I was both a simpleton of fan loyalty and grew to become a suspicious close reader of his tales . He told me much , often surprising in its frank detail , but I think he wanted me to be one of the recorders for posterity of his life . " Keep teaching me , " he said till his death in 1989 . I hope to keep the flame alive , even if it means besmirching his memory .
