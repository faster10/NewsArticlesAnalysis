I am also looking into modifying my cabinet and cabinet alike . Because of the ongoing war and an increase in Defense , I am constantly adding to our Defense Resources . This also means I will be adding to the cabinet in the White House Cabinet Room . I ' m having the work contracted out to add another sixteen inches in width to the old , wooden cabinet you know , for jackets and accessories that the new Defense team might want to store there . Upon completion , the new cabinet will be strengthened like never before .
