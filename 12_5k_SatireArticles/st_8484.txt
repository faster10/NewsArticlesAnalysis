A prison league would address one of the more challenging current issues of player conditioning and team scouting , since players doing time could still display their skills and be " game ready " when they transition back into the general population . The ability to maintain endorsement contracts alone makes the Player ' s Union a strong proponent of the PFC conference . Gene Upshaw , head of the NFL Player ' s Union was quoted as saying , " Hell yes , it ' s a good idea . It ' s about time . " Although it may seem a bit too creative , the plan is a logical move forward for a sport that struggles to manage such a large number of players moving in and out of incarceration . And while the plan does have a long way to go before it could be implemented , there are some aspects already decided : all NFL suspensions would run concurrently with prison sentences ( naturally ) and the league isn ' t ready for PFC teams to be eligible for the playoffs or the SuperBowl .
