Our most valuable asset is our skin , which the Japanese invested their time and money in measuring . The method the Imperial State Institute for Nutrition at Tokyo developed for measuring the amount of a person ' s skin is to take a naked person , and to apply a strong , thin paper to every surface of his body . After the paper dries , they carefully remove it , cut it into small pieces , and painstakingly total the person ' s measurements . Cut and dried , the average person is the proud owner of fourteen to eighteen square feet of skin , with the variables in this figure being height , weight , and breast size . Basing the skin ' s value on the selling price of cowhide , which is approximately . 25 per square foot , the value of an average person ' s skin is about 3 . 50 . "
