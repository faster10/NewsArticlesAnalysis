To support their claims of increased social status , CrackIt held numerous laboratory tests in which groups of seasoned party goers were asked to identify a " CrackIt " screen crack vs . a natural , organically achieved screen crack . The test group correctly identified the CrackIt phones only 8 . 4 of the time . One of the test group members speaking anonymously , said , " I ' ve been to over 200 clubs , dance parties , raves and after hours parties . I ' ve also gone through 4 phones by cracking their screens . I literally have seen and done it all , and I literally couldn ' t literally tell the literal difference between them ! "
