" Remember , at the time the Good Book was written , I was running around saving souls like a madman , " Christ said . " I couldn ' t focus on a writing project , too . I basically gave My team of writers the broad strokes and hoped inspiration would fill in the cracks . Now , I ' m not saying the New Testament isn ' t good it is . It ' s great ! But by the time I got around to reading the galleys , the monks had already finished the first printing . "
