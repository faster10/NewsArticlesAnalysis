Caudill admitted that she sometimes worries that Aniston is not eating enough . " Jen doesn ' t seem like the type to worry about her weight , but still , it ' s Hollywood , " she said . " She doesn ' t need the stress , and she sure as heck doesn ' t need to be dealing with an eating disorder . " Caudill ' s worries were put at ease , however , when Aniston admitted on Access Hollywood that she " eats like a hog " on set , and hardly has time to exercise when she is working .
