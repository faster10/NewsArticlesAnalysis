Leaders of America ' s Fundamentalist Christian Churches , attending a special summit in Jerusalem this week , along with Muslim and Jewish religious leaders , issued a statement saying that they " have always been devout worshippers of ' Allah ' " . They acknowledged that the word ' Allah ' . . . . when translated into English . . . simply means ' God ' , and that is why Christians living in Arabic countries , have always used the term ' Allah ' to describe their Creator .
