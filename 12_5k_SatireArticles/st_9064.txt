When questioned by our reporter , Rick O ' Shea , Ms Bale said of the incident " I don ' t know what the feck ' came over me , there I was sitting in me back garden playing with it , rubbing it , stroking it and listening to it purr , when all of a sudden this feckin ' cat , Lola , appeared from nowhere and clawed at me underwear . Needless to say , I was struggling to pull my drawers up but the little bleeder would not let go . I just saw red , grabbed the fecker ' by its scruff and stuffed it in the wheelie bin along with me torn tights and ripped knickers ! "
