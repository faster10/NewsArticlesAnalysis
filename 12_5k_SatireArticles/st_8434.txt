Martin Glenn has less of a clue than many who have gone before him . Clearly flapping around to justify his position and show that the FA do have some powers he has come up with a corker to add some mystery and intrigue to the FA Cup . Make Premier League teams play all their matches away up until the quarter finals ? Nope . Revert back to semi finals at grounds other than Wembley ? Don ' t be daft . Bring back replays ? Never . No , Glenn thinks allowing a 4th sub in extra time will give the competition a much needed shot in the arm . Again , if I have not said this already his salary is money very well spent .
