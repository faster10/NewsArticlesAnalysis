Update : One man , two very different personalities ? Sounds a bit trite . An avid reader who would like to remain anonymous said that Manuel ' s yacht story sounds a lot like a heavily embellished event in his own past . In his words : " A yacht ? Absolutely not . A large group of tourists were on a glass bottomed boat tour in Munising looking at old shipwreck sites and I remember someone saying that it was ' so cool to be on a yacht let ' s find a hidden treasure and use it to become Fortune 500 CEOs ! ' That joke fell flatter than a flatlined EKG . " The truth ? We ' ll leave that up to you , but we hope the truth sets someone free .
