Historically , Homeland Security made it clear that there were strict regulations in place at the borders and that no one can ' sneak ' in . Think of the wall between the United States and Mexico .

US travelers leaving the country are x rayed , must remove shoes , jackets , belts , left with hands clutching trousers , while racing across airports to make flights , but US immigration can ' t say " No " to travelers from three nations suffering from Ebola or Hemorrhagic Fever ?
