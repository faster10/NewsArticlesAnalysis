" Why can ' t these folks just put on some shirts and shoes if they want a Whopper ? " U . S . Sen . Larry Craig ( R ID ) asked . " If we cave in to these demands , next year , it ' ll be trouserless Americans demanding equal access to Tavern On The Green . After that , the underpantsless will be calling for priority seating on airplanes . Then , people who are completely naked will want preferential treatment in college admissions . These people can put on a full wardrobe and get treated like everybody else . "
