" We don ' t always use the fireworks , " said Anna , not her real name . " Usually , we use it at the beginning to start everything off with a bang , but we ' ll also air it during the middle when the ratings start to sag . The so called Brittenum controversy proved to be such a real winner for us , and so we kept the ball rolling this week by spreading the news about the provocative layout Becky O ' Donohue did with her twin sister , Jessie . That was absolute genius ! Our website was nearly floored by the traffic seeking out anything and everything they could about Becky . We were going to run on that for another week or two , but the Extra TV show aired it a day late , and poor Becky got evicted . By Monday , she ' ll be forgotten , so it was Bobby ' s turn under the microscope . We needed something on him to leak , and frankly , there just wasn ' t a darn thing ! "
