" I work at the local comprehensive school . I try to teach English . I have to put up with attacks , abuse , thugs chucking things at my back , disrespect , swearing , and shouting in my ear just like a referee but on less than 20 , 000 a year . Now then , you just try and tell me that it ' s right that a spitting , squealing , moaning footballer should earn in excess of 50 , 000 a week . It ' s totally unjustified , and a poor message for kids ! "
