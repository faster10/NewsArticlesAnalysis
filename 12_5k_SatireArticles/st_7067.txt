" We ' ve got Ricky " the Hitman " Hatton to front the advertising campaign , " said Lumberpond . " He ' s every man ' s macho alpha male , and if he wears the make up , we ' re sure that it will give it that hard image that will convince the average bloke down the pub that a bit of colour on the lid of the eye is a good look . Ricky has said he ' ll start his next fight looking like he ' s just finished one ! "
