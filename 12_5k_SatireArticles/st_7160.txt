When we asked AFLAC for a reaction to these charges being made by PETA , one company representative , Haka Lue Gie , stated , " These people are never satisfied . We have tried to make everyone happy , we even made the duck smarter , but no , they want more " . Upon hearing this , another PETA employee , Chris P . Bacon turned to the gentleman and told him that it wasn ' t enough and claimed the company had only one agenda and that was to make money . Several AFLAC executives agreed saying " duh " in what can only be described as a taunting manner .
