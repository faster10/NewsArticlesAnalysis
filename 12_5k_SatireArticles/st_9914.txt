Trump showed himself to still be a birther . Having raised doubts about the birth origins of Ted Cruz and Barack Obama , he is now raising questions about Jesus Christ . " I know the Bible well . Everyone knows the Messiah must be the son of David . He has to be born in Bethlehem . It says it somewhere in Genesis 2 , anyway it ' s in Genesis . But the Gospels give two genealogies and they don ' t agree with each other . There ' s a big story in Luke about how the family had to go to Bethlehem for a big Roman census , when the historical record shows there was no such census in that time . It all sounds fishy to me . It all sounds like some big cover up . If he was really born in a manger I want to see the proof . Where are his papers ? If you ask me he ' s no son of David . "
