As for speech time , now televised as you know , we should all take our cue from our greatest weapon against the Muggles . . . the BBC . Members must learn to move in mock harmony , use gestures more effectively and put major emphasis on every second word , wear proper makeup , never blink at the camera and always hold the chin erect . That is how the world views us . I have in fact commissioned some personnel to train the Honourable Members in these simple techniques . . . techniques I may add that are well known to every , political , half baked confidence trickster in the world . Believe me , I know what I am talking about I have just returned from Northern Ireland .
