" This is the highest ' fine ' response we ' ve ever gotten since these surveys were first conducted in the 1960s , " said Jeanette Franks , an OERI researcher who supervised the survey . " By comparison , in last year ' s survey , just 44 percent said school was ' fine ' today , while 41 percent said , ' ehh , ' and 15 percent said , ' I ' unno . ' This year , the ' I ' unnos ' didn ' t even rank . "
