" I don ' t know how many times me , Mike , and Daniel would break into the dining hall when it was closed , " Allard said . " I remember this one time at , like , 1 : 30 in the morning , we were all starving , so we snuck in through this side door and just went nuts with the cereal dispensers . Mike ate this huge bowl of Cap ' n Crunch , Cocoa Pebbles , Trix , and Boo Berry all mixed together . It was so friggin ' gross , we were laughing our asses off . Stuff like that doesn ' t happen anymore . "
