" From what she eats for breakfast to the way she cleans her home , today ' s woman lives in a state of near constant empowerment , " said Barbara Klein , professor of women ' s studies at Oberlin College and director of the study . " As recently as 15 years ago , a woman could only feel empowered by advancing in a male dominated work world , asserting her own sexual wants and needs , or pushing for a stronger voice in politics . Today , a woman can empower herself through actions as seemingly inconsequential as driving her children to soccer practice or watching the Oxygen network . "
