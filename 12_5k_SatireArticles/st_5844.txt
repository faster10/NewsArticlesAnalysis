That was my favorite part of the Maxim piece . I think it really captured who I was , to the extent that you can capture an unknowable renaissance man . I can forgive how they ended all of my quotes with exclamation points and how they used the world " shrill " and " bleated " more than I would care to note ( 14 ) . All that matters is that they portrayed Mark Shepard in his natural state . Contemplative . Sturdy . Original . A man for his time . ( Their words not mine ! ! ! )
