Organizers confirmed this is not the first time the Masters tournament has been held in an indoor venue . In 1936 , Horton Smith won his second Masters by narrowly avoiding several pallets of cereal and birdieing the final hole at the Kellogg ' s manufacturing plant in Augusta . In 2003 , the Masters was moved to the nearby Delta Airlines reservations call center , where Canadian Mike Weir used a wedge to knock his ball free from a fax machine and sink a chip from 25 feet away .
