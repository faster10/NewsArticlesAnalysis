We are living in a brave new world , at least those of us who can afford it , where thanks to genetic engineering and recent discoveries concerning gravitational force fields , old Empire flatulence by which we subdued the indigenous peoples of Africa , Australia and India will be rendered obsolete as a political deterrent . Yes , Honourable Members , the Colonial Fart has had its day . It has reigned supreme in this House and , more so , in the House of Lords for many years . . . where , even as I speak , Mister Speaker , cumulonimbi of putrid gases emitted by dozing Masons encircle the chamber to stifle rational debate . . . a low blow , you could say . . . but all good things must come to an end . . . if you will excuse the pong . . . . I mean pun . We must restore decorum and good manners to this House whatever the consequences . Flatulence gone , take heart that we still have British diplomacy which is every bit as effective . Let us replace covert biological warfare Mister Speaker with self control and Lavender spray . And I know I speak for many who have not yet succumbed to respiratory disease , existential despair or , worse still , . . . socialism .
