I feel that my time fast approaches , and my Great Endeavor remains unfinished . Thus I fear I must relinquish the burden of its possession to you , my enlightened colleagues , though the act brings me no joy , nor even the slightest salvation . No , alas , ' tis far too late for salvation now . As I fade I can hear Her calling , yes , even in my waking hours . You must not weaken nor turn aside at the thinning of the veil !
