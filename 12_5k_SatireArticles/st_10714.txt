Mr Ernie LaMotta who is current Chairman of " Intelligent Citizens Against Quick Spineless Answers to Difficult Cultural Problems " ( ICAQSADCP ) replied to this assertion by saying , " I think blaming television for violence and other cultural transgressions is an easy way of finding a useless answer to explain a difficult series of circumstances which led to a tragic end " . Mr LaMotta also supported his point by rhetorically asking , " So , how did 1963 television influence the assassination of one of America ' s most beloved presidents Kennedy when most adults were watching black and white telecasts of Carson on " The Tonight Show " ? Also , was John Wilkes Booth actively listening to Marilyn Manson ' s " Beautiful People " right before he shot and killed President Lincoln ? How about someone like Ed Gein was Mr Gein playing " Grand Theft Auto : Vice City " when he abducted and flayed women in his Wisconsin barn ? "
