Newcastle United , a somewhat popular football club near the great city of Sunderland and still a premiership team , is based in the north . NUFC ' s history is long and varied , Kevin Keegan is very much seen as the saviour of the club but as a true Sunderland man , has a conflict of interest in how the club is run . He prefers to feed sunderland with ' peters pies ' as opposed to the ' pukka pies ' that Newcastle enjoyed , many see this as an issue but Peter Theo says its not down to the pie , but the pie lovin and caring and attention to pie detail .
