" One day at breakfast , we heard a disembodied male voice groaning , ' Honeeey , where are my dress socks ? ' " John said . " It went on like that for almost an hour . We left out dress socks of all colors , but to no avail . Then , we started hearing more messages from beyond : ' Have you seen my keys ? ' ' Get almonds when you go to the store . ' ' Did you pick up my suit from the cleaners ? ' Nothing remotely spooky or even interesting . "
