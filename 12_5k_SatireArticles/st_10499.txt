In the year of the " NASCAR dads " and the " Gen X Female " swing voters , another group has pushed to the forefront to capture the political spotlight . The " Foghat Vote " , as it has been termed during the last week of campaigning , describes middle aged , blue collar males in the industrial states such as Michigan , Ohio , Wisconsin , and western Pennsylvania .
