" Wheaton recently introduced a website that provides potential visitors with a suggested itinerary , " said Johnson , who seemed very comfortable with imparting intimate details on the World Wide Web . " Out of towners have said to me personally that our site is very helpful , and pointed out many interesting facts . Not very many towns of our size have their own ice rink , or a 70 year old bandshell with its original aluminum exterior , for example . It feels good to let others know that . "
