This isn ' t the first time EA Sports has been in hot water over one of its games this year . The release of the popular Tiger Woods PGA Tour franchise was delayed because of its failure to notice a ' hidden ' component of the game . Players could unlock a ' 19th Hole ' feature , in which the gamer ' s golfer avatar could select from 19 women of varying beauty following a tour victory for a ' night out ' . The evening ' s experience would help to determine whether the golfer would play well the next week or get chased across the fairway by a golf club wielding spouse . Upon discovering the error , EA immediately pulled the game to make the ' 19th Hole ' function more readily available for its 18 25 year old demographic . EA ' s NFL Madden 2011 is also under intense scrutiny for its addition of a new " Pit Bull Blitz " that can be used only against Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Michael Vick .
