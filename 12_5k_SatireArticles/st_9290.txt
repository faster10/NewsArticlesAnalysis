Sherriff Ballard goes on . " We are experiencing severe drought , 105 degree temperatures , and we have a Burn Ban . So when the torch came through , we were asking the USOC to keep us updated on their progress through the county . And so when a huge fire started in a pasture adjacent to I 64 , we were surprised to learn that it was started by the torch and the torchbearer tried to put it out himself without letting us know . " ( The torchbearer ' s name was reported to be either Barry Larkin or Bert Button , although his name was not released by the USOC . )
