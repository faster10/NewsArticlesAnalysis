" Man , it ' s the greatest feeling in the world , knowing that I could do anything right now , " Anderton said , sitting at his desk at 8 : 30 p . m . Friday . " I don ' t have any kids to worry about or a mortgage to pay . If I wanted to pick up and backpack through Europe , I could leave in two weeks , no questions asked . Of course , that would set me back a little , career wise . "
