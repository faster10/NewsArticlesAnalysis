" I like my job as senator ! " said Rigby , speaking from his Georgetown area group home Monday . " I do good work ! I sign everything myself no stamp ! I have a lot of friends in the Senate . Trent Lott , John Warner , Charles Schumer , Dianne Feinstein , Russ Feingold , Wayne Allard , Tom Daschle . They ' re all invited to my house for popcorn ! I ' m just as good as them , and I want to be treated just like normal . "
