" It is obvious to me there is a conspiracy " claimed a Nigeria player , " I was running for the ball , when I was clothes lined by the opposition keeper , whom then proceeded to punch and kick me and he got away with it , the ref said he saw nothing wrong then booked me for diving , how ridiculous " . Another Nigerian player was drop kicked into the crowd during the match , then suplexed before getting ' Hulk Hogan ' style leg dropped by a Greek player whom also went unpunished by the ref in an incident described as " clearly offside " .
