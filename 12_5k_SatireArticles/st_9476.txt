Nevertheless , Mr Farfenoogle did enter politics and was elected to office . " At first I coasted on my disability , since I could just tell the public sob stories so they ' d vote for me out of pity . But then disaster ! I was being interviewed by a pack of reporters and suddenly I realized I ' d run out of preapproved talking points . It was like losing your life preserver and being cast adrift at sea . ' How do you respond to that specific criticism ? ' they kept asking me , and I was running on empty . Should I risk an invocation of forward motion ? I thought , even though I could move only backward . Shall I still fall back on that platitude ? I had no choice since the alternative was to have an actual public conversation . But that would have exposed my sociopathy , which I ' d cultivated while training to be a politician .
