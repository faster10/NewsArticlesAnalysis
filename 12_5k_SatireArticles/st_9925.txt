Australian actress Cate Blanchett was actually land born in Texas , ( surprise , surprise ) and could run for president . Mel Gibson , always thought of as Australian , was actually land born in New York and could also run for president . Michael Caine could not run for president . Prince William could not run for president , and though the Queen of England , Elizabeth cannot run for president . The list is endless , so why does Canadian born Ted Cruz insist he is eligible to run for president ?
