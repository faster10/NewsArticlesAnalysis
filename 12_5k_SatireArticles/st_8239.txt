Continuing , Worst laughed , " And I could teach Giggsy a thing or two about shagging ! Seriously though . The standard of football up here in Heaven is pretty poor even with all the great players we ' ve got . For instance , my old mate Sir Bobby Lesse ( a former team mate at Fulham and ex England captain ) has lost virtually all of his pace now and seems happier just harping on about his past glories rather than playing the game . I want to do more than just talk a good game . I want to get back out on the pitch and do it again . I ' d love to pull on that famous red shirt again and hopefully pull a saucy bird after the game ! " Joked Worst .
