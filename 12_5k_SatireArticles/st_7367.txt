Asked what he thinks of Lorde , veteran decrepit rocker Keith Richards had this to say , or rather , mumble : " What ' s all this about a Lord then ? Is that some sort of a return to the old English society ? Here ' s Lord So and So , come up to the palace and have dinner with Baron So and So . Brian Jones knew quite a few lords back in the day , but they were all queer . In England we don ' t usually use the word queer , we call them poofs . Like , you ' re a magician or something , poof . But you Yanks know what I mean . Incidentally the heroin was very pure in those days . It isn ' t now . "
