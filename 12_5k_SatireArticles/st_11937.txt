" I was a great improviser , but people didn ' t get me , " Wisken said . " I would just kill these scenes , but nobody was smart enough to laugh properly . I ' m talking choice bits , like acting retarded , or doing an accent . I had a black friend of a friend who would do this thing with his lips , and I thought that was so funny . I ' d do it onstage using this perfect Jamaican accent I learned from Disney s Cool Runnings . But people just weren ' t ready . "
