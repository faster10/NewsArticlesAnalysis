" Every time I got a refill , I dumped out the ice and got more , newer ice , " Turnbee said . " There wasn ' t really any reason to do that , since my old ice hadn ' t melted yet and was still perfectly good . But I just figured , ' They ' ve got plenty more ice , so why not ? ' Plus , I liked pressing the little lever on the ice dispenser machine and hearing the loud clunking sounds it made . "
