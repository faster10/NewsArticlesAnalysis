Doch Bagge , a critic famous for pointing out controversial topics in a movie , as well as a long time Disney fan and Brony , agreed with these complaints . " I couldn ' t have agreed more . I truly expected more from Disney . They are a company that brings fairytales to life through their movies , breathing life , magic , and wonder into them , as well as merchandising characters from Disney films for all its worth ! But Venture Into The Woods fails at this Disney aspect in every level . Hansel and Gretel is a beloved fairytale that clearly originated from Caucasians . How in the world could Disney make these treasured characters colored , and not keep it true from the original material ?
