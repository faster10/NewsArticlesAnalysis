" I ' m skating on thin ice living my life like this , but chasing after those extreme risks is just in my blood , " said Erickson , who noted that spending the vast majority of his time in a slumped or fully recumbent position is all part of the nonstop game of chance that he thrives on . " I know that if I keep tempting fate by stretching out on the sofa all day , I ' ll eventually pay the price , but I ' m not someone who can do things halfway . If I ' m going to play with fire by lying across those cushions every chance I get , then I ' ve got to go all out , with as little bodily movement as possible . That ' s just the way I am . "
