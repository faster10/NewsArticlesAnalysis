" I thought I had it in the bag with Zack Keeler back in 2003 , " Broderic said . " When I first read his amazing Gatsby essay , I thought , this kid is really going to deliver . I ' m going to give him some extra attention , and he ' s going to get out of his tough neighborhood , maybe become a writer himself someday . Nope . Dropped out junior year and was cleaning pools last I heard . Completely crapped out on me . "
