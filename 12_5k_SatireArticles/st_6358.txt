These are two garbage teams who got into the playoffs I don ' t know how . I heard the crowd made an earthquake when the Seahawks scored their big touchdown last week , but I think that ' s probably untrue . It ' s like when Chili ' s says they have the best lunch combos but they really overcook everything and get mad when you order a soda refill right at the end of lunch because they want to give away your table . But you get UNLIMITED SODA REFILLS .
