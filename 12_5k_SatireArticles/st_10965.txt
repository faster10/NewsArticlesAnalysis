" Apparently the hole thing was sparked by some , ' Monster Truck magazine ' published in the 80 ' s . It had a title that read ' If you do not like Monster Trucks . . . you might be gay ! ' The entire magazine was poorly written . It is as if they have little to no grasp of the English language . But we translated our speech into the context of the magazine . Timmy Tucker thought we were calling him a ' faget de foot puff . ' Whatever that means . . . and apparently his retort , ' Monster Trucks are not gay ' meant , ' can we have intercourse . I am a straight male with gigantic genitalia . ' "
