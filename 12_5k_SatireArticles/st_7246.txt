Bobby Bennett , back home today in Denver , not only confirmed the story , he faxed to us a transcript of a meeting he secretly recorded when producers confronted him about not keeping his end of the bargain . " They were really pushing for me to be gay , or something along those lines . ( A producer ) kept asking me about that , and even asked if I had ever been an escort , or ever used the services of one ! I kept telling them I hadn ' t , and that it wouldn ' t be such a good idea anyway , considering the controversy poor Clay Aiken is suffering from right now , and that ' s when they hit me with the clincher . They said there was no way I would win the competition , and being controversial was the only way I could provide entertainment so , that made it okay . "
