" Go to your local pond and look at the ducks . They swim majestically in the water . Do you see them fighting ? Do you see them dropping anvils on each other ? What you do see are a group of birds , calmly swimming and socializing . They will chase after thrown bread crusts to entertain children . They will quack to help teach the youngsters the sound that a duck makes . Picture a duck on the water It is an idyllic scene that has been painted onto many a canvas . It soothes the spirit . "
