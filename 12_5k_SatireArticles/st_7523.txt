When challenged by an In Seine news reporter , Mears , 22 ( stone ) , broke down in tears and confessed : " It all began about five years ago when I had just left college and was bitten by a funny looking spider and broke out in a rash and developed some kind of eating disorder . You may find it strange , but I became anorexic and bulimic at the same time . I went to see my doctor who recommended that I eat fast food because he was concerned about my weight loss but also that I ate some natural herbs that would in effect detoxify and purge the effects of the junk food from my body . That was how I became interested in natural foodstuffs . "
