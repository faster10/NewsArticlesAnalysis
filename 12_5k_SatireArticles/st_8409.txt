If someone wants to guess what Manning is going to do , they would first have to understand that he doesn ' t play for the records , he plays to win Super Bowls . It might be nice to break Favre ' s completion record , but it is probably not enough motivation to get Manning back on the field . With that in mind , the general consensus is he will call it a career at the end of this season . His struggles this season have been frustrating , but perhaps he knows his skills are starting to erode .
