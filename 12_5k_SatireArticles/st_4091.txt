" It is pretty sad to think we ' ll never use that rope swing again , though , " she continued . " I remember when Cathy Meyer of Boulder , CO , Arthur Johnson of Montgomery , AL , Linda Taylor of Kenosha , WI , Juan Sanchez of St . Petersburg , FL , Kelly Norris of High Point , NC , John Krasinski of Los Angeles , CA , Sarah Morgan of Hammond , IN , Dawn Peterson of Renton , WA , Victor Wallace of Flagstaff , AZ Stephen Wagner of Tulare , CA , Samantha Duncan of Omaha , NE , Stacey Bradley of Lubbock , TX , and Tony Schmidt of Clarksville , TN were always afraid to use that swing , but then one day they finally did it and we were all so proud . God , I ' m going to miss stuff like that . "
