" Rosie ' s just as fat as she was when she had her talk show , " Hines said . " In fact , she ' s fatter . So I think if you gave Rosie a Krispy Kreme doughnut right after she ate a full dinner , she ' d probably eat the doughnut , have another , then get an ugly retro ' 80s haircut , do some unfunny standup , and leave in the middle of her set , because she ' s a quitter and a lazy cow !
