Do we really want to condemn our children to mental torment and sleepless nights trying to memorise such drivel ? And it is not only the kids who will suffer . The proposal for a compulsory minimum sleep allocation of 15 CentiESUs ( whatever they are supposed to be ) per working shift can only add confusion and yet another level of costly bureaucracy to our already immensely complicated and convoluted employment laws , driving yet more firms out of business . Furthermore it takes away the workers ' hard won rights of taking a zizz or two , or even a quicknap whenever they can get away with it , thus leaving them dog tired and unable to turn up for their traditional tax free moonlighting jobs . The Great British Kip must be saved . UKIP has initiated a series of wildcat halfkips in key sectors of the economy to make our point . If these do not lead to the proposals being withdrawn then we shall mobilise to the full for an immediate and indefinite mass sleep in .
