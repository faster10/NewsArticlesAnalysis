' I was never that fond of Hilary , she got very boring after a while . She was too young for me , and why should I wait for her . There are many things I can do to Lindsay which I couldn ' t to Hilary . I don ' t regret my actions , i was only in it for the money . ' Says Joel . It was on holiday in Paris when Hilary found out . She had been very busy and had no idea what Joel was up to . To make it worse , he cheated on Hilary with her all time rival , Lindsay Lohan ( Mean Girls ) . The two first fell out when Aaron Carter secretly dated them both , 5 years ago . Apparently , Lindsay tried to end the feud , but when she called Hilary , sister Haylie Duff said no . Haylie and Hilary deny this .
