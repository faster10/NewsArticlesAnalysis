" In the days after the fire , there basically were no Chicago Bears , " said Mayor Richard Daley . " It took men of vision to found the team in nearby Decatur in 1919 , move them to Chicago in 1921 , and hire George Halas to coach them . The Bears made a huge effort to attract such great players such as Red Grange , Sid Luckman , Dick Butkus , Walter Payton , and Brian Urlacher . Basically , since the fire , they ' ve turned the team from a total nonentity to a championship contender . "
