Christiane Amanpour of ABC Correspondent said , " Ninety six percent of Louisiana residents and ninety seven percent of Mississippians rely on public assistance for basic needs and , now that these states have been severed , residents will not have access to medical care , food or clean water . Young children and the elderly will be the most severely affected with hundreds of thousands dying from everyday diseases like the common cold while competition for food will escalate to violence . Chaos will rule until a group of militant extremists takes over and enslaves the rest . They will commandeer the food sources and weapons and those who don ' t die by random executions will suffer slow agonizing deaths from starvation . Does this bother you , Mr Duncan ? "
