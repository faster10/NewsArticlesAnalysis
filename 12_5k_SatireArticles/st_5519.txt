" It ' s about finding real meaning , real truth , in your heritage , your nation and your race , " said Berliner Klaus Hofbreit , 18 . " This isn ' t just about the clothes I put on , or the music I listen to while marching across neighboring countries ' borders . It ' s about finding strength in who you are and triumphing through sheer will . It ' s about my kultur , know what I ' m saying ? The totenkultur . "
