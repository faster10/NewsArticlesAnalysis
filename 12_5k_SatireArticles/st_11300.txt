Paul Martin proceeded to plead with the United Nations , which has so far not taken any action as a result of Bush ' s nuclear weapon threats . " Please , somebody , please , " said Martin . " I ' m asking now , anybody , please , all , or any , or at least one of our allies , please contribute something to the war effort here in Canada . We won ' t survive another week of invasion . All I ' m asking for is anything I can get . The more help Canada gets , the closer we come to forcing the United States into submission . That should be our goal , to combine all our militaries and force them into submission . "
