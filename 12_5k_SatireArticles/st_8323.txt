The ex England footballer Paul Gascoigne has tonight revealed he has been left devastated by the loss of his favourite fishing Rod . The fishing rod is said to have been especially dear to the Italia ' 90 hero because it had been signed by every single Newcastle United Player ever to have ever been on Match of the Day . Yes , that ' s right . . . just Alan Shearer . But he signed his signature in very large handwriting and he wrote it with two pens . A black one and a white one to match the colours on the shirt they both played for . So it was a bit special .
