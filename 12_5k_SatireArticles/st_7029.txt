While the final details have yet to be ironed out , it appears that the Pony Express riders will run mostly along major US routes and highways with mail being thrown off at each of the routes exits . Mail recipients will be responsible with checking their local exit each day to see if any mail has been delivered to them . Although , there is a good chance that not all exits will be hit , especially those going north on I 95 , those that are will have consolidated mail for all the exits heading northward , so don ' t worry if your mail is not at your exit , you just head on down south and check all the exits until you come across it .
