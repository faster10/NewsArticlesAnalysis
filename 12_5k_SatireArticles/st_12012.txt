On the War in Libya So now we ' re fighting over in Libya , but we ain ' t really fightin ' ? We ' re only supposed to be there for a few days , but it ' s already goin ' on a month ? France don ' t want to help us in Iraq or Alpogannistan , but they want us to help them in Libya ? We wanna get that feller Mohammed Quiddich outta office , but we can ' t find him ? Hell , we been searching for Osama Bin Alladin for over ten years and for all we know , he could be the caveman in them Gecko commercials .
