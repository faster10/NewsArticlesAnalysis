Meanwhile , back on The Moon , U . S . intelligence has detected increased military activity . " In the past hour , we ' ve observed several massive craft emerging from craters all across the surface of The Moon . . . and . . . oh , hey , here they are now , " said a military analyst , pointing up . So far , there have been no wide spread reports of cattle mutilation , however , incidents of " cow tipping " continue to sky rocket . Experts have cautioned people not to panic , and to use duct tape and plastic to cover all doors and windows . " Yeah , it ' s air tight and you ' ll probably die of suffocation . . . but that beats being enslaved by Moon People , " said a spokesman for Homeland Security from an undisclosed location . Upon hearing the warning , Moon Ambassador Vox laughed out loud and released this statement : " Get real , people ! You pin heads wouldn ' t even make good pool boys . "
