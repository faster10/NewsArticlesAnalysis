The political cartoonist promises to use the website for both exposing the federal bank and political parties involved in the exploitation , as well as contributing to social science and engineering in a way never before possible until now . A new feature for example , is being added to the website for people who have the most influence over other people . This feature adds to the already existing ban feature , but , the influences not only receive a permanent ban , they also unlock a secret board that only they have access to called ban . Users of ban can only post in one topic at a time . New topics are created when the old topic reaches a certain limit in messages , but , images aren ' t allowed and each topic is a random topic someone else posted , allowing for banned users to still have access to the websites features . The experiment will reveal that the difference between cultural change is really just a minority of intelligent individuals who exploit the natural stupidity of the public at large .
