I don ' t understand why these issues have to be such a big deal in the first place . I mean , it ' s not actually illegal to call someone a " tranny or wear a yarmulke as a joke , just like it ' s not illegal to not hold the door open for someone or to ask a fat lady how many months pregnant she is as a goof . And if it not ' s enforced by the law , why should I make a point of observing it ?
