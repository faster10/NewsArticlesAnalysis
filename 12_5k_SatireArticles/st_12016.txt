Four woodchucks were trapped for the experiment . One was placed in a pen with an axe ( to chop wood , in case " chop " was the meaning of " chuck ' ) . Another was placed in a pen with a chainsaw ( also to chop wood , in case " chop " was the meaning of " chuck " ) . A third was placed into a pen with a pile of chopped wood and a target ( in case " throw " was the meaning of " chuck ' ) . A fourth was placed in a pen with a television set and a six pack of beer ( this was the " control " animal ) .
