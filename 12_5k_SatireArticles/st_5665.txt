SAN DIEGO , CA Citing " sagging first quarter profits " and disappointing 1995 revenue figures , the San Diego Zoo announced yesterday its decision to lay off nearly 2 , 000 animals , including all giraffes , vultures , elephants , snakes and a number of rare Siberian tigers . The creatures , many of whom have been with the zoo for over 30 years , have been released from their respective cages and pens , and are now free to roam the city in search of new homes , food sources and employment opportunities .
