Manny Fishburn of Coulee was bowling in the next lane when he said a shiny object past by his head mere inches away . " Everyone had stopped bowling except me ' cause I was concentrating on a four ten split , but I ' ll spare you the details , " Coulee said with a grin . " Then I saw this thing teetering back and forth near the pin area like it was confused . . . then it was dragged into the pit , and we were watching the pin setter come down . "
