Continued Bingham : " I was working part time at a video store , so I sometimes didn ' t go into work until noon or one in the afternoon . For a while there , it was ' get off work , go out and party , sleep late , and do it all again the next day . ' I knew it was no way to live , but , you know , you get into a downward spiral and it ' s hard to crawl back out . "
