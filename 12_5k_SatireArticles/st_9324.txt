" How many martial arts and kick boxing trophies did Ryan win or can he be plausibly believed to have won , " Romney asked ? " Some guys are big on talk about all their fantasy achievements . Not Chuck . Remember all those times he played a Texas Ranger who was always saving the lovely , whiny and needy Alex from evildoers in Walker Texas Ranger ? That really brought home to me just how tenuous our lives are . No big talk action heroes do not grow on trees unless you know to tune in at the right time to some obscure TV channel repeating such Norris classics as Lone Wolf McQuade , A Force of One , Silent Rage , Hellbound and Missing in Action .
