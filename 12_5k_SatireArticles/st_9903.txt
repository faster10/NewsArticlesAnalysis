I ' m doing all I can to get fit for this office . I can now spell Syria . . . but I still have trouble with the capital , Dummasskiss . . . . . . . . and don ' t ask me where they are . Somewhere east of Kentucky , I guess . I know the difference between gun and gone , though . I think Ronald is underestimating the range of skills you need to run for the Presidency . I can spell that , too . "
