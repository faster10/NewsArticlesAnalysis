" I didn ' t say the President called anyone , I said he called on someone . " Anticipating the follow follow on question , Carney continued , " the difference between calling someone and calling on them is that when you call on someone you don ' t actual call them , but you speak to a third person or group of persons instead and hope the other person overhears you . This is also different from the President ' s approach to the recent spat with Putin over the NSA leaker , Snowden . In that case , the President announced in advance that he would neither call Putin nor call on him . These are both subtle ways of ensuring that if the other person doesn ' t do what you ask , you can deny that they refused you . "
