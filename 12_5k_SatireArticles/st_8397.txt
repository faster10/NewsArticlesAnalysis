And next season , after Boynton does another little something criminal , anti social , and outrageous , he ' ll be playing for a minor league hockey team like the Youngstown Phantoms , Green Bay Gamblers , Chicago Steel , Brookings Blizzard , or the Minot Minotauros . His fellow team mates will yell on the ice : " Hey Old Man ! Fling that puck my way ! I ' ve got a clear shot at the goal ! Are you farsighted ? ! Do you have dementia ? ! Look at me , I ' m free and clear here ! " I don ' t think Boynton will need the money or anything these old jocks just have to have a spotlight shining on them when they age , get arthritic , and wither away . But of course , if he keeps gambling , a ( possibly ) then busted Boynton just might need to return to the ice as a minor league upstart just for a salary .
