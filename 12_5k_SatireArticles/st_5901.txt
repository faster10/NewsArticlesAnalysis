" Craig can ' t entirely help himself , being a Gemini , " Hitchens said . " Geminis are always very skeptical and destined to feel pain throughout life as a result of their closed mindedness . If you try to introduce Craig to anything even remotely made up , he starts going off about ' evidence this ' and ' proof that . ' If only the poor man were open minded enough to stop attacking everything with his brain and just once look into his heart , he ' d find all the proof he needed . But , sadly , he ' s unable to let even a little bit of imagination drive his core beliefs . "
