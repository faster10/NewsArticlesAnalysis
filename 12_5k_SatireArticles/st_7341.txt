" I ' m Britney and this is Hollywood . We have all of the special effects stuff and ILM out here . We sent Captain Kirk into space and made radios out of coconuts for Gilligan . We help Oliver Stone re write history with all of his movies and help Michael Jackson ' s nose get different with every video . We keep Dick Clark from aging and Hugh Hefner ' s thingie from falling off from overuse . We make talking cars and animals and lots of other neat stuff . If I say that I want to have ten babies in four years ( apparently her goal ) , then my agent will make sure that I get those babies . "
