But the counsel for the defense effectively demonstrated that the only phone line Webb tapped was that of a single mother in rural Kansas . " Clearly , Mr Webb is guilty of nothing more than being lonely . Is it so hard to believe that someone who spends most of his life on the road wouldn ' t be ? He ' s not gathering intelligence for the NSA . He ' s not selling data . If he gets any kind of reprimand from this jury , it should be a slap on the wrist for a single instance of voyeurism . Maybe if AT T didn ' t require their workers to slave away in the middle of nowhere for months at a time , pulling 14 hour shifts in most cases , this wouldn ' t be a problem . He ' s not a spy , he ' s a one time Peeping Tom . And I think even that ' s too harsh a judgment on his character . "
