" When we received Mr McMahon ' s application we were instantly struck by his , well , let ' s say balls ! He is a true hero , without him millions of ordinary people wouldn ' t receive their paper clips . And more importantly he has really broken down the stereotype of what it means to be a woman in today ' s society . He has shown that yes , a woman can be a truck driver , and yes , she can also identify as being a man . This proves that being a woman isn ' t all about what you have between your legs . It ' s about courage , determination and the will to succeed against the odds . Mr McMahon has demonstrated all of these qualities and more . He has had to battle against being too thin and short sighted to achieve his dream of being a lorry driver . Thankfully he has overcome these obstacles and that is truly inspirational . "
