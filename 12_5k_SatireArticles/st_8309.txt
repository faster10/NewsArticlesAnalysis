Although FOX Sports . com published a horrid rant by some writer named David Whitley yesterday ( see " It ' s Time for Tebow to Just Move On " ) , which in journalistic terms , was more pathetic and asininely amateur than any dying buzzard pass Tebow ever made . And it ' s about as fair and balanced as a game played against the Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field . The most lucid comment made in this commentary was this : " . . . . . , , 28 . . . " And this quote wasn ' t even Mr Whitley ' s own words no , he actually stole it from someone else ' s facebook page . And what ' s " 28 " doing in there ? Is this some coded virus to send a PC to the junkyard ?
