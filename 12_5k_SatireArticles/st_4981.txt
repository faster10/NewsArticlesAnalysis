" We buy a huge bag of food at the Safeway every week , and Digby just gobbles it up and comes back for more , as if we ' re still living in the boom years of the late ' 90s , " said the dog ' s owner , Lewis Chambers , complaining of the household pet ' s ravenous , fiscally irresponsible eating . " How anyone could be so gluttonous while we ' re seeing some of the worst economic indicators in generations is beyond me , but Digby just doesn ' t seem to care . Hell , he won ' t even eat regular dry food now unless the canned stuff is mixed in with it . "
