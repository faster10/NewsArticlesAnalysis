Colton also fondly recalled his last Christmas with Smolensk . " One of my gifts to her was a Thighmaster , and she got all excited and asked , ' How did you know I wanted to work on my thighs ? ' " Colton said . " How did I know ? Well , I would often see her standing in front of her full length mirror and , just from the way she looked at herself , I could tell she was unhappy about all the dimples in her thighs . That ' s just the sort of deep understanding we had for each other . "
