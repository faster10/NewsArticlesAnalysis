" I ' ve heard about this prat before , " he said , after working his way through Arabic , Kung ! and Scandinavian epithets . " He once did an old granny for dropping some cotton off the back of her coat , and a two year old girl for sneezing onto the pavement . He just doesn ' t get it . Personally , I think he ' s trying to justify his department . I mean , let ' s face it , the council has to save something like two million quid this year , and losing his entire department wouldn ' t be a bad start on that . What exactly do they do ? My department empties bins . I ' d like to see the councillors get reelected if they binned our department . If they binned his , I don ' t think anybody would notice . "
