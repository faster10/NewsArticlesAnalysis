" So , if I ' m talking to retirees , " Romney continued , " I lie and say I ' ll fight tooth and nail to save Medicare , which causes them to applaud . On the other hand , if I ' m talking to the party base , I lie and say we have to cut Medicare , which causes them to applaud . So , you see , my goal here is to get everyone applauding for me , because if everyone is clapping their hands , standing on their feet , and shouting my name , that means they like me and will vote for me .
