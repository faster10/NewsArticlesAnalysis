' " He ' d rather be out with the horse and cart or up Scotland on the moors shooting stuff with his shotgun than fannying about on the Thames in a tarted up coal barge , watching yet another bloody fly past , while some young twonks pluck guitars and caterwaul into microphones for half the bloody night on The Mall . And to be fair I can ' t say that I blame him . "
