Team sources confirmed that it took Garnett approximately one hour and over 15 tries before he finally touched the rim , though he reportedly came very close several times , often touching the middle and top sections of the net . During one instance , which his teammates were quick to point out didn ' t count , Garnet jumped to grab the net with both hands , then pulled himself up and hung on the rim . He then told teammate James Posey to throw him a ball , which he eventually managed to dunk before releasing the rim and returning to the ground .
