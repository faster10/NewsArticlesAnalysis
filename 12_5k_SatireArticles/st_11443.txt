Sandy " Shorty " Shortman , the chief elf in charge of Santa ' s workshop was more sympathetic to Rudolph . " Rudolph ' s still a champ in my book , said Shorty . " What the heck you expect from these guys ? " " Rudolph flies all over the world once a year at speeds up to warp 10 delivering presents to all of the world ' s kid , and if he needed something to help him get over , then so be it ! " Shorty also admitted to us that if it wasn ' t for " the euphoric high " that results from smoking elfin homegrown rainbow dust , the elves wouldn ' t get half of the toys made that they do now .
