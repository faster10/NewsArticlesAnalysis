Luckily , the President , always on his toes , already had his ' bug out ' bag packed so it was a matter of stopping by the pro shop at Andrews Air Force base to pick up a case of Titleist Pro V 1 ' s ( 62 a dozen ) , 4 new Nike left handed golf gloves ( 29 . 95 each ) , a resupply of 3 1 4 inch tees and a brand new Foot Joy rain slicker at 159 . 95 , ( the Presidential seal would be sewn on by Michelle ' s seamstress during the luncheon flight to Otis Air NATIONAL GUARD base in Mashpee before hopping aboard Marine one for the short hop to his austere retreat on the Vineyard )
