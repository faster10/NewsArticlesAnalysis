" There is no way that Jesus , 2000 years ago , could have walked around in Jerusalem single , without being stoned to death . It was sacred Jewish law that all men must be married and be fruitful . Setting that aside , that Jesus could have well been married according the new ' Gospel of Jesus ' Life should cause Holy Mother Church to reconsider its patriarchal structure and its sexist treatment of women . Obviously women should be Priests , Bishops , Cardinals and Popes . "
