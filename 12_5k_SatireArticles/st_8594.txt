" Folks , I think it ' s glaringly obvious that this is so much more then a publicity stunt . Our organization is committed to the cause , we fight , with blood , sweat and tears , each and every day to accomplish our mission . While cynics may question the motives of anointing a person who ' s been a severe detriment to a high profile position , this famous athlete has explained to me that he is dedicated to our cause . Of course I was questioned his motives , he ' s never contacted , nor shown the slightest bit of interest in what we ' re trying to do until the second he needed to win people over , but he has assured me that his stature will help proliferate the ideals of our cause even if it means sacrificing the foundation of our morals . I want to make it explicitly clear that we will support this famous athlete throughout his tenure as our spokesperson and will continue to do so until he no longer needs the publicity or happens to actually be a terrible person who disregards his dedication the moment it is no longer advantageous .
