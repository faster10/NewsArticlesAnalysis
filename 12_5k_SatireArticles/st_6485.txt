" I definitely have decided that , when we get back together , I need to spend more time by myself , " Marlene said . " I never realized how much I ' d let Paul ' s interests or lack thereof take over . Now , I can go anywhere I want without Paul grilling me . I go to the park just to hang out , and I ' m joining a community theater group with my friend Neil . There ' s so much I want to explore before we get our marriage back on track . "
