Mr Erdogan continued by saying , " Since the whole of Cyprus was taken into the EU , by joining that island we too become de facto in the EU . It will of course be some time until reunification , but that will come soon enough now that we are all part of the same great Christian family . In the meantime we have decided to use our soldiers in Cyprus to dump soil brought from Turkey into the Mediterranean between Cyprus and Turkey . Once the land connection is completed in a matter of months , we will be in a position to say Turkey is geographically indisputably part of Cyprus , and therefore part of the EU . This should also help relax those who say Turkey is not part of Europe because of geography and there ' s the Aegean Sea and lots of water between us bla bla bla . "
