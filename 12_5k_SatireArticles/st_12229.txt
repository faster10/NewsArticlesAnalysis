A North Korean scientist who briefed the press , but was not authorized to speak on the subject , said the rocket would reach Uranus using 450 , 000 metric tonnes of specially formulated fuel . With the fuel source expended to reach Uranus , docking cranes would then load up the fuel storage tanks with the rice for a return to North Korea . As the scientist explained in simple terms , " 450 , 000 metric tonnes of rice will force the laws of gravity to take over , and our glorious ship will float gently back to earth like a fragrant flower petal in the breeze ! "
