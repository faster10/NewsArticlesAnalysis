It is a long way down from that , and I took it hard . I was on Sherbet when I was 9 , and I had a solid addiction to Liquorice when I was 11 . I knew then that I had to stay away from drugs , and alcohol , so I became a Monk when I was 16 . I stuck that till I was 22 , and then went into business . Of course , being a Monk for all of that time taught me something about silence , and no one asked about my criminal record . Well , they would not think a former Monk would have been into Scrumping Apples from Farmer Jones , but I was , I was hard man , Conker champion and everything .
