In the U . S . , Center for Disease Control spokesman Imso Measley said the results certainly come as a surprise . He admitted that his preliminary review of the research found the statistical procedures to be every bit as sound as Dr Jones ' other well known work . " I am embarrassed to say it , but we at CDC have not performed this kind of correlative research since our study of second hand smoke . Perhaps we need to get more out of our box and question old paradigms , " said Measley .
