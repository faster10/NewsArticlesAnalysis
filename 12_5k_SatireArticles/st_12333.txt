A citizen ' s right to keep and bear arms for personal defense unconnected with service in a militia has been reaffirmed in the U . S . Supreme Court decision ( District of Columbia , et al . v Heller , 2008 ) . The Court Justice Scalia wrote in the majority opinion : " The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia , and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes , such as self defense within the home . " " . Justice Scalia went on to define a militia as " comprised all males physically capable of acting in concert for the common defense . " " The Anti Federalists feared that the Federal Government would disarm the people in order to disable this citizens ' militia , enabling a politicized standing army or a select militia to rule . The response was to deny Congress power to abridge the ancient right of individuals to keep and bear arms , so that the ideal of a citizens ' militia would be preserved . " he explained .
