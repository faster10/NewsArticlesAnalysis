Menendez is no stranger to helping out his buddies , and his own personal interest . A few years ago he was called out for putting pressure on an investigation into a local NJ bank , First Bank Americano ( hola ! ) which had been cited for gross misconduct and malfeasance . Boom Boom advocated for a buy out of the bank to save it from going under , while coincidentally 8 of the 15 Board members accused of malfeasance and lack of oversight just happened to be major donors to his campaigns .
