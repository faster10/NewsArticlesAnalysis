" Somewhere between the smoke monster ' s first appearance on Lost when it was depicted as a strange unseen force uprooting trees and that episode in season three where it grabbed Mr Eko and smashed him against the ground until he was dead , this character became the breakout star of the show , " said Stephen McPherson , president of ABC Entertainment . " And that ' s exactly why we ' re so excited about Where There ' s Smoke . We get to see the monster ' s light comedic side in a show about life , love , and good friends having good times . "
