" If I was in his shoes , I ' d be pissed too , " said Padalecki . " But when I realised what the role actually was , I wanted off the movie . My contract said the only way off would be to be sacked . I couldn ' t quit , or I wouldn ' t get paid . It may seem a bit drastic to look more like Daniel Day than Doris Day , but I needed off before they got me in a dress . "
