" I honestly don ' t get Mike does he even want to get out of that backwater town and try to make something of himself , or does he want to just waste his time feeling pleased with the pace and content of his life and enjoying his existence ? " high school friend Caitlin Sese said of the man who gets eight hours of sleep per night and has time after work to see his loved ones and take care of his health . " Everyone else left Camden as soon as possible and is consumed by a deep sense of apprehension about getting ahead , but he ' s still hanging around the same places from high school , focusing on the things that matter most to him , and existing as a relaxed , easygoing person who ' s fun to be around . I can ' t imagine anything sadder than that . "
