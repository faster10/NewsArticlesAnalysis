" I don ' t eat that great , " Bartlett admitted . " My doctor tells me my heart ' s in bad shape , my blood pressure ' s through the roof , and I could drop dead pretty much any day . I ' m also at risk for Type 3 diabetes , which as I understand it is even more dangerous than Type 1 or 2 . But one of the few positive things me and my wife do for ourselves is get Chinese takeout at least a couple times a week . And I generally get the pork lo mein , which has like a ton of water chestnuts in it . Thank God I ' ve been getting something my body really needs . It probably saved my life . "
