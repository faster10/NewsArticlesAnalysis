" It is a disaster " agreed backroom staff member Barry Grant , " no matter how much we roll the pitch , as soon as the lads get on it they cut it up worse than a back street bouncer from Bootle . We came in one morning and some of the lads had even hung up tyres from the crossbars for the boys to swing from . The crossbar broke of course , and the gaffer insisted on bringing in a new one from Patagonia . Unfortunately its not much KOP and falls off every week , but Raffa seems set on persisting with it "
