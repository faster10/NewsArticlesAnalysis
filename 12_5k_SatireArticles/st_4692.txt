Sources noted that the festivities extend beyond the city limits to Arlington , VA , where patrons can visit the Pentagram , which this year will reportedly feature a constantly circling swarm of spooky Predator drones painted to look like bats . As in years past , Arlington National Cemetery is likely to be among the Spooktacular ' s biggest draws , with workers once again erecting thousands of temporary tombstones with rhyming epitaphs and adorning the grounds with fake limbs emerging from the earth . Additionally , visitors can gather to hear ghost stories every 20 minutes at the Tomb of the Undead Soldier , where for the past 30 years John McCain has lurched out from behind the monument at the very climax of each skin crawling tale , typically resulting in dozens of visitors screaming , fleeing , and even fainting in terror .
