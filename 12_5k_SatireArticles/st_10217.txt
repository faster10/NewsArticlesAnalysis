The more Wal Mart is able to reduce its costs , the more we are able to roll back prices , and the more we roll back prices , the larger our revenue , market share and stock valuations become . This situation , along with the business friendly Bush administration policies , will allow us to roll back prices for consumers , by rolling back our overhead costs , the vast majority of which is labor .
