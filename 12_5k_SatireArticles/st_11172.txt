The Minister declined to discuss the implications of the interpretation of " psycho active " until the legislation is in place . He said " Such minor problems as to what a few unusual words mean can be sorted out when the ban is actually in and working . " He added " Most people know what we mean by the word and will do what we want and obey the law without question . " He refused to discuss such " shilly shallying with words " as he called it . He said " It will all be sorted out later . Leave it to us , we know what we mean the legislation to achieve and that ' s all that matters . It is not the place of ordinary people to question the government ' s intentions "
