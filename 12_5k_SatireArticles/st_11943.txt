" I can make it to the lather and scrub step okay , but then it gets all weird . Where did those paper towels come from ? We have an air dryer . Whaaa ? I just don ' t know what to do after that so I wipe my hands on my sleeves , or stick them in my pockets to forget about it . But sometimes I don ' t wear pants with pockets , and then I can ' t forget . Ooooh boy , those are the bad days . "
