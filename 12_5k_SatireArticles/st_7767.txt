Jolie , one of the world ' s most beautiful nut jobs , has admitted she needs to hone her ' Jibberish ' , the native language of Ewoks . On a more serious note , Jolie said that in the late eighties she a owned a jacket made out of Ewok fur . A gift from her actor father Jon Voight , Jolie says the jacket was typical of her father ' s insensitive nature and a catalyst for a rift that has lasted to this day . Jolie has vowed to protect Tattoo Coleman from the spotlights of not only the media but the fur hunters as well . Like elephant ivory , the fur of Ewok continues to fuel an illegal multi million dollar a year trade , despite a global ban since 1984 .
