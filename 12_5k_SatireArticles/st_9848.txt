Commissioner Trager ' s line of reasoning is as to the point as a Glock 9 millimeter . Is there any way you can tell whether a guy just got released from a mental hospital ? And with so many people receiving Social Security Disability for mental health reasons ( wise guys call these payments from Uncle Sam " crazy checks " ) , how would you stop a full blown paranoid schizophrenic from drinking up a half month ' s SSD , then going bang ! bang ! bang ! shoot em up crazy after renting a gun ? He ' s not a gunslinger , even though he thinks he is and actually , he ' s just a garden variety nutcase who ' s watched Sukiyaki Western Django ( 2007 ) more than 200 times , has gone off his Seroquel and Depakote , and after leaving the bar portion of the restaurant , feels ten feet tall and bulletproof . Even while in balance and flying straight , this guy acts a lot more Mike from Swingers than John Dillinger or Henry Starr .
