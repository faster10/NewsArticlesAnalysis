Apparently , the lead elephant was ready to breed ( we learned later that her name was Nancy ) . The donkey ran to the front of the line , jumped up and tried to do his duty . The fact that he was four feet too short didn ' t stop him from wearing out the elephant ' s back left heel . She had to shake him off a couple of times . At one point , the bald clown on the donkey ' s back got stuck under her tail and some other clowns had to pull him out . Everyone , except the skinny bald clown , had a healthy guffaw over that even the donkey with the blond wig . Trump himself straddled Nancy ' s neck . Like a good horse , the elephant was sensitive enough to be guided by his knee pressure . No one had explained that to Trump . Every time Trump turned around to wave at the eastern European girls on the horses , Nancy tried to follow his direction and turn around . Her trainer would then have to pull her back to the front of the parade . After the third time , she started to get pissed off . Now , it ' s one thing to have a little fun dry humping an elephant like the donkey with the blond wig and bald clown , but you don ' t ever want to piss one off because you can ' t make up your mind about the direction you want to go .
