Female Mud Wrestling Czar : Ernie Silverstein , the largest campaign contributor in New Jersey ( whose multi billion dollar Solar Energy company was one of the many that went belly up after receiving millions in stimulus money ) will be in charge of seeing that fair practices and proper health benefits are enforced with women participating in this sport . Mud temperature and the amount of gravel within the mud will be monitored to see that it remains at safe and non toxic levels . The job is expected to require frequent travel to all fifty seven states and the possible establishment of many regional and district offices .
