Jed Thornapple like the word repent ' often and with a loud voice . Using it got his young ass out of a long prison sentence over at Leaky Cock County when the judge didn ' t believe his alibi that he thought the girl he was caught with was 18 years old . Being that the girl was also the judge ' s niece didn ' t help matters , but a hearty dose of repent during final pleadings won his case and set him free . It worked another time too , when a visiting married woman named Marion Chambers and himself were caught by a very angry Mr Chambers who had a propensity for using rather large firearms in a most peculiar manner .
