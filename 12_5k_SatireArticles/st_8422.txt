In 1980 MIT was commissioned by the NFL to produce a learning machine that would " through environmental exposure eventually develop the ability and understanding , champion and embody the principles and interests of the corporate interests of the NFL . " The completed robot , affectionately named Roger ( due to his programming that requires him to respond affirmatively to every corporate command ) was turned over to the NFL in 1982 . In August 2006 it was determined that Roger had learned everything that was necessary to perform his intended function , and on August 6 of that year , the previous NFL commissioner , Paul Tagliabue was asked to step down to make way for the fully groomed corporate machine .
