The new iPhone 6 ( or 7 or 8 or maybe 9 we ' re not sure no one tells us much these days ) came out the other day ( yeah we know we ' re behind with the story , shut up ) with people queuing for up to ten days to buy one . Knowing we couldn ' t afford one and lacked the skills required to pinch one we lifted this full review of the iPhone 6 off another website and have pretended that it ' s ours . With a couple of our own observations added .
