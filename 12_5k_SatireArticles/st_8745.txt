Liberal elements within the church have attempted their usual sidestepping of fundamentalist beliefs by reinterpreting impossible ideas as mythology and metaphor . One liberal bishop supported the activists by arguing that a resolution to defy the law of gravity was simply a poetic expression of the need for the Church to " rise above " secular criticism . This interpretation became unsustainable , however , in the face of activists explicitly stating on national television that they intended to literally rise up through the atmosphere and enter low earth orbit . Evangelicals have claimed that some of their number have already done this in anticipation of a positive vote by the General Synod . Unfortunately , no concrete evidence of such flights has been made available .
