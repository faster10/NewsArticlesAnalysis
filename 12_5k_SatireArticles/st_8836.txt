As you look for that first home , we will make sure the banks are there to fleece you and the carefully controlled interest rates on your pathetic mortgage keeps you tethered to your worthless jobs for life . And we need good waiters and bellhops in this country , let ' s be honest , good mindless , qualified paper shufflers especially , beguiled teachers , traffic wardens , fantasist soldiers and our private bodyguard the Police Force . More than anything , we need ambitious , reliable lawyers without remorse or conscience who can implement our will and protect the rules of International Law that we have drawn up in our own interests , without which our rampant , free market imperialism would be impossible .
