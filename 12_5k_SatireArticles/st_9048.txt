Former paratrooper , Tully , said , " I had just finished fixing the carberetta on my Mitsubishi Lancer and had gone upstairs to wash my hands , when I noticed Tarquin ' s body through a gap in his bedroom door . " He went on , " . . . I was shocked to see his lifeless body hanging from the ceiling , I saw the satsuma in his mouth , and thought that was so Tarquin , he was always preparing fruit salads in his bedroom " .
