" I find it to be racial in it ' s motive , I mean ' Black Friday ' is the day you get all the good deals out shoppin ' , what they really mean is ' on this day you can be like the black man and almost ' steal ' all this stuff , or , be like the black man on the government assistance and get all this stuff without havin ' to pay for it " .
