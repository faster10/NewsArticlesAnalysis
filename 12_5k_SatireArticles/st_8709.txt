Another Tory minister told us , in confidence , " Too many idle buggers are living off the state in luxurious houses with things like hot running water , doors and windows . Frankly it has to stop . Stick them in a workhouse and we all benefit , pardon the pun . It would reduce the benefits bill significantly and also free up loads of housing so my friends and I can increase our property portfolios . Personally if I had my way I ' d just have them all shot but apparently that ' s not allowed . Bloody do gooders have ruined this country . "
