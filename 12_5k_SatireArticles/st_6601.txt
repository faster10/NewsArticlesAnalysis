" After all these years of tireless effort , it is deeply validating to see the Supreme Court come to its senses and give all money the freedom to engage in the political process , " said 80 year old business magnate and lifelong currency suffrage proponent Sheldon Adelson . " Frankly , this ruling is long overdue . This isn ' t the 1800s anymore you can ' t just leave major political decisions to limited groups of money you have to hear from all of it . Over the decades , a lot of stubborn , resistant people have tried to rally against expanding the rights of money , but at the end of the day , those efforts to thwart the progress of money ' s role in American government failed . Slowly but surely , the strength of cash prevailed . When you have enough cash working together for a single cause , no one can silence its voice . "
