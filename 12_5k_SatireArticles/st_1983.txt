" It ' s kind of weird , but Dad has barely yelled at any of us since we got here , " said Danny , 16 , explaining that the family has had a few arguments here and there , but nothing that has spiraled into the kind of intense , drawn out shouting match they have typically experienced by this point in previous trips . " No one ' s really thrown a fit at all . Maybe it ' ll happen tomorrow morning when we ' re trying to load up the car quickly so we can get to the airport on time . I don ' t know . It ' s gotta be just a matter of time , though . "
