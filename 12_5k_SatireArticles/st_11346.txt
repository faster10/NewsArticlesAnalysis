The new helmet visor treatment also has several significant additional benefits for creating an anti fogging surface when an ultra thin application is also given to the inside of the helmet visor . Another benefit is a significant reduction in surface beading by rainwater on the visor . The treatment works as an instant wetting agent and lowers the surface tension of the water droplets from 72 ergs cm 2 to less than 20 ergs cm 2 . This gives a significantly improved level of visibility especially in low light conditions or when oncoming headlamps are causing a significant amount of refractive light scatter from the water droplets forming on the inside of the untreated screen or visor .
