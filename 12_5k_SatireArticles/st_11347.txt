BMW research is also involved in pioneering other applications for the new material technology . Including various aerodynamic sound proofing helmet modifications made in an effort to reduce interior noise levels . Previously , the only modification which achieved a significant reduction from previously reported average sound levels was the incorporation of a pair of industrial strength earmuffs under the helmet shell . This gave noise levels of 84 dB ( A ) at 22 m s ( 50 mph ) and 93dB ( A ) at 36 m s ( 80 mph ) , compared to known average values of 95dB ( A ) and 107dB ( A ) , respectively .
