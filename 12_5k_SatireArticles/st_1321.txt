" Some of my friends were going to vote in the election , but I didn ' t really care about it enough to go , " Berger said . " I was sorta like , ' What ' s it matter ? ' If I ' d have gone to vote that day , I never would ' ve run into Sofia at the Starbucks , and we never would ' ve started this massive apolitical movement . Who says that two people can ' t make an indifference ? "
