" Mondays , I focus on chest and triceps , " Vanderbilt told Kim , after she said that her 232 pound coworker " must go to a gym or something . " " I usually start with the flat bench press , which works the whole chest . Then , I move on to the incline and decline bench press those focus on the upper and lower chest , respectively . Sometimes , I do dumbbells , just to mix it up . For the triceps , I usually do french press and dips . "
