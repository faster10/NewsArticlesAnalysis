" It ' s insulin , " said Bonce . " The hormone normally associated with diabetes . This is why you ' ll never see a bald diabetic . Whilst all animals use insulin to maintain a healthy glucose level in the body , in humans , a mutation means that it not only binds with liver cells , but also with the receptors of head hair follicles . Over the years this clogs them up and they cannot regrow . So you go bald . On the plus side , no hair means no insulin problems . "
