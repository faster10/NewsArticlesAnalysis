" While expense is something to consider , I think it ' s very important that we have this kind of scientific apparatus , because , in the end , I have always said that science is more important than it is unimportant , " Committee chairman Rep . Bart Gordon ( D TN ) said . " And it ' s essential we stay ahead of China , Japan , and Germany in science . We are ahead in space , with the NASA rockets going to other planets , so we should be ahead in science too . "
