We had so many questions . Is there nobody fighting for the forces of good , nobody not aligned with either the Vampires or the Zombies ? Will the Vampires wrest control from the Super Zombies and the massive hoard they control ? Will the public be allowed to live quite lives of fearful desperation , waiting for the evil lottery , and losing by feeling the sharp hot pain of the fangs in the neck ? Or will we all be forced to join the zombie collective all equal equally deranged and depraved no more fear or emotion of any kind , just the instinctive drive of the hoard ?
