' The problem was compounded in 1980 because the Flame was not well attached to the torch , ' explained Sebastian Coe , chairman of the Organising Committee for the 2012 Games , who also helped to search for the lost Flame in Moscow . ' The wind not only caused the Flame to become invisible , but we believe that it also detached the Flame from the torch . This made it impossible to relocate . In the end , runners had to return to Greece and start again . The flame for the 2012 Olympics will be held to the torch by a combination of Araldite , super glue and nails so that if it becomes invisible , we won ' t lose it . '
