" Honestly , we tried everything , " Wendy ' s research and development head Charles Cullen said . " We tried including free packets of our tomato catsup sauce , but people said the sauce was too sweet . Then we tried putting some cheese on top of the patty , but people didn ' t like how the cheese melted on the meat . We even tried stacking two hamburger sandwiches on top of each other , but of course everyone hated that because it just meant having to eat more hamburger sandwich . "
