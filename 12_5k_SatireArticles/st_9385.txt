Lakes and other water reservoirs seem to be the next DHS target . There are experimental systems being evaluated that will allow states to dehydrate their lakes and water reservois and store the dried water in decommisioned Titan missile silos . KBR , a Halliburton company , has been identified as the contractor that will retrofit the missile silos . Secretary Chertoff said that this would take some research since there is apparently no verified way to rehydrate the dried water . Secondly , the former Soviet Union has raised strong objections to the use of these silos that were decomissioned under the historic START . Also , senator Ron Coleman ( R MN ) has promised to fight this measure . " We will never accept to be called Land of Dried Lakes , " Senator Coleman thundered in an address to the US Senate .
