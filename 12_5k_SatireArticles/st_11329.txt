When asked about the documents , Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that today " employment is rising not falling " which is a typically obvious statement because the damage to personal property and businesses will require extra manpower to correct the outcome of the blast . The PM went on further to say " we are well placed to deal with the fall out " , though nothing in any of the Labour government ' s manifestos since coming to power have ever mentioned dealing with radioactive fallout , adding he was unaware of the documents and Britain would be protesting against the upcoming inspections by UNMOVIC .
