Ter within an inch o ' me life . Goo on . Ah deserve it . Ah ' ll tell thee worrid is though Ah ' m just dead passionate abaht gravy . So , ter ' t KFC Ah ' m dead sorry me loves . When tha ' s as passionate abaht gravy as like wot I am , it ' s an easy mistake to make . Anyroad , As geet nay time ter ' ang abaht , coz Ah ' m off o ' er yon pond ter that Americky . Blame t ' t ' wife fer that . She were watchin ' Man v Food tuther day an ' there ' s a shop o ' er theer wot does ' ot pastrami sarnie , and then they dip t ' roll i ' gravy . Looked reet grand it did , so Ah ' m off o ' er theer on t ' thaeroplane . Ah ' ll ' ave summer that , n ' no mixtake ! "
