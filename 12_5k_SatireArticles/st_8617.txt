" I ' m not a hundred percent , " said undercover reporter , John Smith ( not his real name , his real name is Matt Smith , but people confuse him with Doctor Who , so he uses a nom de plume ) . " I think he was on the phone to his sheik bosses , and he was saying that he ' s going to ' throw ' the FA cup , although it could have been ' win ' the FA cup , the two verbs sound similar . He then said something about City probably or definitely having a Champions League place . "
