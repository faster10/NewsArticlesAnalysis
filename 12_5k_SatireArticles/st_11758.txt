" I am no judicial hero I simply dared ask the question most never thought to consider : why did the complainant allow the sex to happen if she didn ' t want it , " said Justice Camp , speaking to reporters on Tuesday . " It ' s really that simple . Back in my day we didn ' t have any of this fandangled assault nonsense . We knew a woman wanted to have sex because she was a woman , and she was there . This is why I chose to apply the first doctrine of the Bro Code , Bros Before Hoes . "
