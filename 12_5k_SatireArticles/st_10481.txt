But an incident like that , or the nine other incidents just like it in rapid succession , did not deter George from looking for love . And on the 11th time he got lucky . " Well , I admit I tried to put the odds more in my favor . Not only did I have the exact change , like I ' d been careful to have the last few times , but I told her we ' d have to go someplace first . I suggested Jumers , an upscale hotel , and one that I ' d rented the suite of for the past several weeks , for just in case I met someone special . " Now still only a few thousand dollars out in his quest for love , George took Amber back to his suite . Ordering strawberries and champagne , he settled into a chair with some paperwork , after putting " The Best of ' I Love Lucy ' " in the DVD player .
