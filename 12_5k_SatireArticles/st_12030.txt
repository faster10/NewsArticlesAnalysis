" I remember that little hard on , " said retired guidance officer Gladys Rothenbotthum . " Creepy , furtive little BASTARD with his hands in his pockets all the time playing with himself ! He was sent to detention more than once where we had to slap his little schlong down with a wooden ruler . Must have liked it because I think we went through a dozen rulers in his four years here , and he always came back for more ! Politicians , who knew , EH ? "
