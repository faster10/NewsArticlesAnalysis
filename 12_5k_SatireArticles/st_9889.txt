Another inmate , 1 , had great things to say . He explained the night that James thought he saw him robbing a bank and arrested him . " I was just walking by the bank , and he said it looked like I was stealing the money . I know how good of a man he is , so I figured he was right . He ' s such a great man . I wouldn ' t be where I am today without him , " said inmate 1 .
