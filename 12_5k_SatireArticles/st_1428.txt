" I ' m sure a lot of people returning next year will miss ' Rock Blossom , ' but life must go on , " Haley said . " I ' ve never regretted doing a show , even though it meant missing some cool parties . In the end , it was worth it . My music was the soundtrack to a lot of people ' s college years , which makes me feel really good . And if nothing else , I ' ve exposed the people of Charleston to the music of NoMeansNo . How many people can claim that ? "
