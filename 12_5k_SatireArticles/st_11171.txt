The Australian government is planning a blanket ban on all ' psycho active ' substances . A spokesperson for the government said that they are having trouble keeping the list of banned drugs up to date . " No sooner do we put a substance on the list " she said , " Than someone changes it or renames it and it isn ' t covered any longer . " It is claimed that having a blanket ban on all such drugs will save time and effort spent in keeping track of new drugs .
