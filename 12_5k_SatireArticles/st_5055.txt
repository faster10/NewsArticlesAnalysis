While Pupamalu adeptly defended against short , medium , and long haired puppies , the young canine was too enthusiastic at times , forcing Animal Planet referee Andrew Schechter to call him for unnecessary ruff ! ness and illegal paws to the face , penalties enforced during the ensuing lickoff . Pupamalu was also initially given a Puppy Foul for expelling feces in the end zone however , after the referee called a " Time Oust " to dispose of the waste matter , the instant replay clearly showed that quarter hound dog Buster was at fault for the offense .
