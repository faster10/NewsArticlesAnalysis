Despite the enthusiasm the so called " Darwin Smudge " has generated among the evolutionary faithful , disagreement remains as to its origin .

A smaller minority contend it is the face of Carl Sagan , and should be viewed as a warning to those nonbelievers who have not yet seen his hit PBS series Cosmos : A Personal Voyage .
