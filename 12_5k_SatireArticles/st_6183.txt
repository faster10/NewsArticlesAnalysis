" You stupid idiot , " the elder Geremek said . " Thirteen years it took us to perfect those coordinate calculations , and another seven to build the thing . Not to mention the months of endless wrangling to get our project funded . Now we have to start over because you didn ' t give the thing proper time to reach its core temperature , damaging the acceleration mechanism . I told you to wait in the car while I got some papers . What were you doing in there in the first place ? "
