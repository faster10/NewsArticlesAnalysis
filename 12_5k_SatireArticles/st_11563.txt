Bereft , alone and hysterical with grief , Haruka Shindo phoned the police who arrested her husband for mass murder and wilful destruction of a virtual empire . Mr Shindo has been released on bail with the condition that he cannot approach a computer or switch on a mobile phone or go anywhere in the world which has satellite coverage . You guessed it he was been lowered to the bottom of the Marianas trench in the Pacific which is 10 , 000 metres deep . His trial date is January 23rd , 2014 and let ' s just hope he doesn ' t drown by then .
