" Just yesterday , George stormed an Iraqi machine gun nest when our sergeant took one in the belly , " Pvt . Scott " Lumpy " Fellers , 20 , told reporters . " We were pinned down , cut off from our division , and it looked like curtains for us all . Thankfully , George was there . He ran through heavy artillery fire and lobbed a grenade right into their bunker . If it hadn ' t been for him , God knows how many of us would ' ve been coming home in body bags . " " It ' s not just any president who would risk his life like the nation ' s men in uniform do , " Fellers added . " God bless him and everything he stands for . "
