" I just don ' t think the whole thing ' s been thought out very well , " Jerry ' s mother told us , " I mean what happens with ' Ben Jerry ' s Fossil Fuel ' ?

Ben ' s going to be fine with ' Peanut Butter ' , but who ' s going to buy ice cream that tastes like a cup ? This is what happens when you let hippies start a company . "
