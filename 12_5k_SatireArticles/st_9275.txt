The price of the Island for a sovereign nation to take complete control is reportedly in the 100s of billions of dollars . A lease would be worth at least 50 billion . That ' s not chump change . A source close to Mr Brown let us in on the secret plan . " It is tempting . We need money so bad that we are willing to sell off one of our prized possessions . But to offset the loss , we are planning to start building islands , manmade islands off the coast near Malibu and San Diego . We generate so much trash in the cities here that we need to do something with the garbage anyway . So with the money we get for Catalina , we are going to make resort islands out of landfill waste . And the loss of Catalina will be forgotten as we get revenue from the sale of these manmade beaches . "
