Persons of celebrity receive honorary degrees from Universities all of the time . Many schools will award a millionaire or military hero or government official an honorary doctorate just to get them to speak at their commencement exercises . For other schools , it is a way to sell fake degrees in order to get large donations . It has also become a way for schools to get publicity . On rare occasions , it is a way for an institution of higher learning to reward someone for their contributions or influence at that school . This last reason is the case at El Paso Community College .
