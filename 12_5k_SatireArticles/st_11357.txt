In his press conference the Prime Minister said : " It took us a while to figure this out , but we are confident that this new arrangement will make everyone happier and save everyone from lengthy and expensive accession negotiations . Personally I am finding it harder each time to tell my wife that I have to stay out late for yet another dinner with Chirac and Schroder , and come back home wasted after plying them with drinks trying to make them say yes to Turkey ' s EU membership . Plus as you know I ' m a tolerant soft spoken kind of fellow who doesn ' t drink , and it just became too much for me . "
