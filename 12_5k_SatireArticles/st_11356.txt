In a strange twist the Turkish Prime Minister Mr Erdogan declared that the Turkish Parliament has unanimously passed legislation proclaiming the entire population of Turkey aged zero and above as being Christian , and that Turkey had decided to dissolve itself and had declared itself an integral part of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus . Mr Erdogan said , " of course the new law applies only to formerly Muslim Turks . It excludes those Turkish citizens who already are non Muslims . Otherwise such forced conversion would be unconscionable . "
