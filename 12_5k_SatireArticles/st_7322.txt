" With a bit of a headache raging , I managed to get up off the bed to search for my clothes . Then Ms . Pattie came in and told me to find something in the closet and to hurry as she had an appointment to get to . Well of course all I could find was a tuxedo which happened to fit me perfectly by some strange reason . We rushed down to the lobby and out of the hotel where Pattie pushed me into a waiting limo . Funnily enough , we ended up at a small marriage chapel and was told by Pattie that it would just be a few minutes , go up to the alter , let the justice of the peace say a few words , and then she would take me back to my hotel where I could prepare for my early morning flight home . Having agreed to all this , in a less than a clear state of mind , I can say that she lived up to her part of the agreement , having deposited my at customs after checking in with Virgin Atlantic with my luggage .
