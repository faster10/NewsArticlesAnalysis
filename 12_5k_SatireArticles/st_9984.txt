" Your Republican governor is not doing her job in helping to unite the party . She ' s not supporting the wall in a state that ' s right on the border . If she want ' s to keep her job , the first thing she needs to do is change the name of the state to something that isn ' t going to attract more illegal immigrants . They ' re coming here and they hear about this state that even has Mexico in the name , and they can get drivers licenses and food stamps . The governor needs to make the state seem more like America , instead of an extension of Mexico . "
