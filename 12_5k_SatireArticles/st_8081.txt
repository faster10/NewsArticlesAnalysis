Mexicans are now being employed to light the shuttle ' s ignition fuses which instead of being done electronically for the solid fuel strap on boosters and through hypergolic action for the LOX Hydrogen mixture of the main engines are now lit through the use of joining together many firecracker fuses . The Mexicans are given a very long stick match and then they run like hell after lighting the fuse . This saves NASA millions of dollars for each launch . Mexicans also are being used to wash the shuttle after it lands and to give it a complete detailing job .
