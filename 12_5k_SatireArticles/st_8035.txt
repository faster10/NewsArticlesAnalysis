SCIENTIFIC THEORIES : In Boston , it ' s 90 degree days oftentimes as the springtime progresses into summer and all this mess has to have something to do with that Global Cooling theory . Do you need any more evidence that Global Cooling exists ? Jiminy Crickets , man , you ' ve got a six story mountain of proof right there in The Athens of America that melted , leaving behind a three story dump heap ! That ' science experiment ' Commissioner Dennehy was squawking about , just off Tide Street , is proof in the pudding ! See , with 90 degree days looming , the iceberg melted because of the ' cooling ' effects of the refuse , particularly from the heat given off by the bicycle tires , which are made of rubber , are black , and are excellent conductors of heat , leaving a half of a 5 bill encased in a large shroud of ice with the other half buried deep in that nasty pile of rubbish . And some lucky devil somewhere in Boston if I don ' t get there first will surely find both pieces of that torn 5 bill , Scotch tape that jagged ragged thing together , then trade in that stoic and somber looking Honest Abe for a pack of Kentucky ' s Finest filtered full flavored smokes . And the cooling effects of the ice and snow stuck in the centers of those orange highway cones further compounds the fact that melting and cooling occurred simultaneously within those plastic encased crevices like raging little forest fires . According to my calculator and the mathematic equations I have at my disposal , sparks had to fly and fires were ignited within the centers of these highway cones . If this isn ' t a textbook example of Global Cooling theory that even Paddutius Tarantula Thistleblossom , Ph . D . and Science Professor at Goodblatter State College , couldn ' t come up with , I don ' t know what is ! It ' s garden variety scientific theory !
