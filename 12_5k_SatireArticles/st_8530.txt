" Oh well , too bad , " said Palin . " Todd was all worked up about helping me read my lines with me , maybe next time Todd ! Todd ! No dear , you can get out of my nightgown now . They gave the part to someone else . No , I ' m sure . I already asked . Oh , now look what you did . I ' ll never get that stain out . Go on outside and shoot me a Polar bear or something , okay ? Would you do that for me , dear ? That ' s a good boy . Don ' t forget your gun . No . Not with that one , the other one . Now put that one away ' till later , before you freeze it off like you almost did the last time . No . I told you . I already asked . Todd ! Todd ! Come back here with my nightgown . "
