Butt Babies are popping out all over the world with mums saying " they were reading about Kims Butt Baby and had an existential epiphany " . One British mum said " it seemed that the social emotional repression I was unknowingly enduring from a society ignorant of Butt Babies was awful and when I let myself be free , the dam thing just popped out " . She quoted it to be " akin to a spiritual release and recommended any other mums who felt they were constantly constipated should take Kims advice and get a butt x ray or what some marketing inclined doctors are calling a butt ray . Even use the office photocopier if you have to " .
