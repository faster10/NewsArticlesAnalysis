Tick shared that a lot of people are ( or were ) lured into church with their friends or family and then pressured to get saved with a feeling of losing those connections without doing so . Thus , all of these individuals were following the steps given to accept Jesus which , allegedly , grants you access into Heaven . Most would also continue to go to church after the fact , but didn ' t get into those pearly gates in the end because a lack of actual faith . Tick states , " What these poor , unfortunate souls were lacking was a sense of actual faith . If you were in a cage with an angry , hungry lion , you might take everyone else ' s word that the lion tamer can protect you . However , until he actually does protect you , most people would not necessarily accept it as fact . If you do take it as fact , that is faith . "
