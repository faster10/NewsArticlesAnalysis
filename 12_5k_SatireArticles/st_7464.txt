We ' re towing the aircraft to a hangar that I ' ve already rented out in case we just park it for a few days as the banks work out a deal with their client . In most cases my clients just want to keep the payments coming rather than to foreclose and try to sell an aircraft of unknown condition . In this case we also have a very valuable jet and the vanity of the client so the banks will probably get most of their money . "
