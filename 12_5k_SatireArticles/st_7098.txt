While at first Alice Becker ' s story seemed too far fetched even for myself , someone who has exclusively covered ancient aliens for 25 years , once I began to the run the numbers I realized I had truly uncovered the greatest middle class conspiracy since Watergate . Think about it people , American ' s purchase roughly 100 Billion boxes of girl scout cookies annually . At 5 dollars a box that ' s 500 Billion dollars . With the individual Girl Scout troupes only receiving a microscopic amount from their sales that leaves hundreds of billions of dollars profit unaccounted for , it ' s got to go somewhere . Plus , no one from Girl Scouts of American agreed to be interviewed , and that always means their guilty . I think once again hard hitting investigatory journalism prevails over evil capitalism and corporate greed . So next time you shell out some cash for that box of thin mints remember who exactly is profiting from that transaction , and then remind me .
