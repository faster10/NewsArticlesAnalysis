" Every day in this country , we are bombarded with images of powerful , destructive wind vortices , " said Roland Gilchrist , director of the Princeton University Center For Media Studies . " Movies like Twister , TV shows like Fox ' s World ' s Scariest Tornadoes , networks like The Weather Channel all of these only serve to glorify tornado violence and send the message that such destructive behavior is acceptable and even rewarded . We shouldn ' t be surprised , then , when real life weather fronts start imitating what they see on TV . "
