And that is exactly how the system works . Love 4 Freedom runs like this : a student applies for Love 4 Freedom assistance . Her application is accepted with a clean bill of health . Upon acceptance , the girl is paired up with a government official over the age of 50 , and is scheduled for one night with this official in a private , anonymous , and safe hotel or sexual meeting place . Once the night is complete , instead of accepting cash or gifts , the girl ' s student loan , no matter how large , is dissolved and she no longer owes the government anything .
