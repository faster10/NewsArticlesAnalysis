" The whole premise of this research into the bird supposedly being the word is false . It is an argument based on personal incredulity , simply because you can ' t think of anything else for the bird to be , it does not logically follow that it is indeed the word . I suspect very much this thinking is based on a western Juedo Christian perspective , what we have to appreciate is that there have been aboriginal cultures around the world each with their own unique insight into whether the bird is indeed the word , some believe the word to be several types of birds , some believe the word to be something different altogether !
