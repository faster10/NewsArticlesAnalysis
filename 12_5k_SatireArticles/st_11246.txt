Some were chanting homeless people are terrorists while others had banners claiming if you start giving 5 to homeless people where will it end some were just angry and shouting about Turnbull giving away wads of taxpayers cash to a pack of lazy bums whilst the majority see going soft on terrorism as unpatriotic and treasonable and are calling for heads to roll . Some had banners saying ' Death to Bin Laden ' and one group told reporters they " had been told the homeless guy was actually a Muslim who had a cat with unpaid parking fines and was on the official PRISM terrorist list " .
