Borders between Gore states and Bush states have been witness to some of the fiercest fighting of the past week . Along the Illinois Indiana border , an estimated 240 people have died in skirmishes , including 47 Danville , IL , residents in a midnight Hoosier raid on the Gore controlled state . On Sunday , police at the Arizona California border turned away more than 40 , 000 Golden State Republicans seeking to cross into Bush controlled Arizona . Democratic refugees attempting to cross in the opposite direction were similarly rebuffed .
