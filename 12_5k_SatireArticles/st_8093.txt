Many a climber and walker over the years have struggled up Scafell Pike in the Lake District to " bag " England ' s highest Peak at 978m . Well the unfortunate news is that nearby Scafell has now been measured and confirmed as the holder of this record at 966m . Scafell Pike has been downgraded to 963m following a remapping by Google Earth . The reason for the discrepancy is put down to " erosional creep " and inconsiderate walkers taking away a piece of the mountain as a souvenir .
