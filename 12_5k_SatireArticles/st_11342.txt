His call was mirrored by the Administratoress of the Tuam Position ( Tridentine ) who yesterday said there is a need to reclaim the " Missionary Position " . Sr Stephenie Farragher said : " There was a time when the Missionary Position was sacrosanct and once entered into ( no pun intended ) it remained in until business was concluded . But all this seems to be changing and more people are slipping out and approaching it from different angles and sometimes remaining open all day and night . In many mainland European countries , the missionary position is still observed with street processions in the afternoon especially in Italy , parts of Germany and Spain . "
