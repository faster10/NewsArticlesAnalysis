Curious , I thought . How could a plane not see something as huge as the Trade Center ? Maybe a pilot had a heart attack and the aircraft turned suddenly , I rationalized to myself , filled with morbid curiosity . Finally , I found a station that had an all news format and half listened to some advertisement about appliances and an annoying commercial about Chevrolets . The announcer and commentator came back on with a news update An airliner had hit the skyscraper ! The New Your Fire Department was on the scene and people were being evacuated and the fury of emergency vehicles filled the streets around the Trade Center . Eyewitnesses claimed an engine from the ill fated plane lay on one of the streets , and pieces of furniture from the tower continued to fall .
