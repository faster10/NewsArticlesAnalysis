As part of the universal agreement to silence Bayless , Major League Baseball will discontinue all play Saturday night after Bayless has gone to bed the NBA and NHL will announce their cessation at an unspecified time this weekend to deny Bayless an opportunity to nastily criticize their playoff pictures and NASCAR will quietly close down once and for all Friday before Bayless can make some strident but idiotic statement about the sport as if he watched it all the time and were not simply reacting to something he had read that day .
