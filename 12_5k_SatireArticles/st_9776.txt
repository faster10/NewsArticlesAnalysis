For 35 years Mrs Voortface defended her positions in regular columns in the village gazette , The Lifeless Lincoln . And she remains a frequent guest at assemblies in schools across the region , where she outlines methods for living soundlessly . She is well known for her demonstrations of the proper procedure for ripping off a sheet of aluminum foil without the screeching , shimmering , strident noises such an act creates . She laments : " I remember the old days when decent folks wrapped their lunches in a clean kitchen towel and our chips in a lovely calm tin . Nowadays they have all manner of paper bags and plastic pouches that produce thunderous crinkles that send Mr Timmy into fits . Then he goes and hides . He ' s got so many hiding places that we ' ve had to call in a special corps of spelunkers to find him each time the people above us open a can of ginger ale .
