Jimmy then motioned to his key roadie who set up Jimmy ' s electric guitar and amp and for the next 2 hours Jimmy repeatedly sang , ' Margaritaville , ' his signature song . After the eighteenth repeat , Mr C asked why such a rich man would sing some vacation song and bother so many people ? Jimmy responded , " Hey , that ' s what I do and I ain ' t rich , my man . Sure , I got close to a mill from you . Hey swami . . . listen up ma main man . . . let you into a little secret . I ' m Jimmy Buffett , the singer guy , not Warren Buffett . I sing for my supper . " " What are you saying , you pedestrian , ? " blurted out Mr C . " I said , I ' m the recording guy , who still needs to make a buck , Mr Gandhi ! "
