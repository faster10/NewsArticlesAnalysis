" This place isn ' t perfect by any means , but San Francisco has been a fixture in this area for years , so the thought of leaving has been really tough , " said Gonzalez , noting that anyone who wanted to stop by San Francisco ' s original location should do so in the next three weeks before it closes for good . " The bottom line is that we have to move out if we want to keep our heads above water . Sure , our new San Francisco location might not look as nice or have the same character and charm of this place , but that ' s the trade off we have to make if we want a space we can afford . "
