But these mistakes of mine do not affect my decisions as the forty third Prime Minister of America . The war with Iran , for instance , was justificated . Saddam Hussein had WMDs and Weapons of Mass Distraction hidden , and one day , I promise to find them . And I knew the economy may have suffered . But it ' s your money . You paid for it . And I think war is a dangerous place , but people always assume the worst will happen . Well , I didn ' t fall for any of these hypnotheoretical arguments , I did what I firmly believe is right . And when we talk about war , we ' re really talking about peace .
