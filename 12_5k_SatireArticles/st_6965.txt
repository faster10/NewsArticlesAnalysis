The change of heart came as the result of an incident during a Sacred Sword of Righteousness rally Monday in Damascus , Syria . According to witnesses , as SSR leader Waleed bin Aziz mounted the steps leading to the stage , he tripped over his robe , causing him to lose his balance and fall face first into an audience member ' s bowl of yogurt . At first , those in attendance held their breath and stifled their laughter for fear of execution . But then , bin Aziz stood up and , after a long pause , threw up his hands and erupted in laughter , breaking the tension and freeing up the crowd to do the same .
