Responses to a telephone survey taken by our unbiased reporters this morning revealed that most humans in Australia want the extra terrestrials out . " We aren ' t safe .

" No extra terrestrials were interviewed in the survey as it was thought that their opinions would be too biased in their own favour to be of any interest to our human readers .
