Gary from the Working Class Alliance somewhat agreed with Johnson , " What he ' s basically saying is that life is survival of the fittest but in intelligence terms . Fair enough , so how about we apply ACTUAL survival of the fittest where physical capability becomes important too ? I mean sure I wouldn ' t beat him in a Latin test or Political History exam but i ' m pretty sure I could beat him at running , beat him at throwing , beat him at joinery , beat him , yeah just beat him , i ' m sure . With pleasure . "
