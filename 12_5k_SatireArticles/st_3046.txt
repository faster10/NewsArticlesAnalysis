" It ' s weirdly self centered and creepy to be broadcasting my whereabouts to the whole world , and then be rewarded for it with some worthless piece of clipart , " said Tampa , FL college student Theresa Gibson . " I don ' t want to know where other people are , I don ' t want them to know where I am , and I definitely don ' t want it all to be tracked by a website that pits us against each other to see who can share our locations the most . Frankly , it doesn ' t make any sense why that would ever appeal to anyone . "
