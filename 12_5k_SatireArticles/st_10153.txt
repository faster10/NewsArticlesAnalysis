A pajama clad Sean Hannity described the scene outside his posh Long Island home as the most " vicious " attack to date . " Since the South Carolina debates which Guiliani won hands down I ' ve hardly slept . I keep hearing " You ' ve Got Mail " throughout the night . Its those ! Ron Paul " spammers " coming at me from everywhere . I don ' t know how they do it , but their emails appear legitimate coming from unique IP addresses from all across America " , Hannity said . " Of course , everybody knows that Ron Paul can ' t have that kind of broad appeal . Ron Paul ' s campaign is just the Democrats trying to stir things up . I can talk over him any day of the week : WMDs are all over Iraq Terrorists they hate our freedom you know all the stuff I say just drowns out the Paul supporters . "
