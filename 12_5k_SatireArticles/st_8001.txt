During Fuller ' s surgery , a windstorm Jones ' " Act of God " kept cutting the electricity and interfered with the TV picture of Miss Fuller on which Shoulahbi was relying .

In those vital minutes , Shoulahbi used a Dolly Parton poster as a model because it was pinned to his door and he had no detailed life size photo of Spears .
