Sarah Palin ' s name has been mentioned as the " family values " candidate but sources worry whether she can afford to travel to New York to meet with Trump from her home state in Alaska . Alaska is very close to Russia . Palin can almost see Russia from her home if it were not for a large fence erected to protect the family from Levi Johnston , her daughter ' s first baby daddy . Russia Federation President Vladimir Putin also favors Palin and would like to know her better .
