" I did a similar thing having Carlo ' s death in The Godfather carry over into the next two films , " Coppola continued . " You ' ll notice he doesn ' t show up in any of the others . That ' s because he ' s still dead in this one continuous storyline . Meanwhile , Connie is his widow , which is me kind of winking at the opening wedding scene with her and Carlo from the first film . It ' s subtle , but once you pick up on a detail like this , you ' ll start to notice many other little connections . "
