In any event , I look forward to the challenge of reading sports stories off a teleprompter a full two and a half hours earlier . The one tough thing is going head to head with Glee , which I believe everyone knows by now is my favorite show . To you my loyal readers I promise this : I will retire all of my personalized Glee hashtags that I use on Twitter for as long as we are on opposite the greatest teenage musical comedy show in television history . Farewell shepardglee , shepardgleek , shepardgleegeek , shepardlea , shepardleamichelle , shepardgleamichele , shepardrachelberry and most painfully , shepardnumberonegleefanintheworld . We had a good run .
