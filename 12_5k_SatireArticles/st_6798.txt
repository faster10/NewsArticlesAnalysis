" To be honest , I never really liked Mindy all that much , " said bridesmaid Ellen Lessing , 24 , a college sorority sister of the bride . " I always thought she was kind of a stuck up bitch . But when she asked me to be in her bridal party I guess because I ' d been her sorority sponsor back in college I felt obligated to go . We ' ve had almost no contact since graduation , yet I still flew halfway across the country just to be in the wedding of someone I hardly even know . "
