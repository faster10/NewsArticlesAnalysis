Regardless of where the idea originated from , San Francisco has been covered with " Nuke the Coal " protest signs , billboards , and public service announcements . One likely reason is that it addresses two issues at once . Coal is obvious because of the never ending press coverage however , if President Obama were to use the American atomic weapons as a solution to Carbon , then peace activists would not have to worry about the US engaging in Nuclear War ( ipso facto , vis a vis , World Peace Forever ) . By strange coincidence , Obama seems to hint that he is ready to " take action " for the Environmentalists .
