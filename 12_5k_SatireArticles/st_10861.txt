" You ' ve got something like two billion people speaking Chinese , English spoken in over a hundred countries as a national language , Spanish spoken by a similar number , Arabic , which is spoken as an exclusive language by an eighth of the world ' s population , Russian which is backed by the Mafia , and French . Twenty eight countries list French , and some of those out of sympathy , like Canada . "
