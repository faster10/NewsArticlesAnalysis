Just down the road a ways the Chamber of Commerce of the Gateway to Death is having a bus tour . The attendees of this gala are sparse . The Gateway of Death ' s Mayor and Safety Service Director were expecting a much larger turnout , but only three people showed up . It is a free tour , too , and the Gateway of Death will be having a little shindig immediately after this bus tour . The ruse and the prize : All you can eat hot dogs and all you can drink lemonade .
