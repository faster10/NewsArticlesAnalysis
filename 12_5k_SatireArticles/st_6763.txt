" Like everyone else , I got sucked in at first , " said the Rev . Paul Doherty , the pastor of the church , who admitted he had once kissed the tears streaming from the eyes of the 5 foot wooden altarpiece . " But now it ' s just too much crying in the morning when I come in , crying during baptisms , crying , crying , crying all the time . I ' ve called around to other parishes , and all of their Marys are doing fine , even the cheap plaster ones that have to stand outside in the wind and rain . There must be thousands of Marys in the Greater Boston area , but ours is the only one who can ' t hold it together . "
