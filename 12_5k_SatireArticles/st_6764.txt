" I don ' t even want to deal with it at all , frankly , so I ' m just going to ignore her , " Doherty said . " Why indulge it , you know ? I ' m not going to debase myself by going over and consoling her and saying , ' Oh , you poor , poor thing , what ' s wrong ? ' Screw that . I ' m going to read my sermon , and if she wants to cry all through it like some kind of grade school prima donna , then she can be my guest , but I refuse to so much as even look in her direction .
