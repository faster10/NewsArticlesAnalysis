Let ' s hope this kind of Wild West drinking game doesn ' t begin its process from the gun range into the bar side of the restaurant . Some things just don ' t mix too well . Like gasoline and fire . Or TNT and fire . Or bleach and antifreeze and human kidneys . The same can be said , too , of alcohol and firearms . Statistics show there are a quarter of a zillion people serving life sentences in state prisons , right now , who have no idea of what they did to get such life whisking consequences . They were all black out drinkers armed with guns and half of them didn ' t know the victims they riddled ridded with lead , either .
