" We of the Oakwood Terrace Condominium Association will defend the integrity of our rule against all pretenders to the board , " said sitting treasurer Norma Klein , who boasts heritage dating back to the original owners of Lot 1003 in Building Zone 2 . " Years ago , my forebears accepted certain responsibilities when they paid the 20 percent preconstruction deposit on our ranch style duplex . Today , it is our duty to preserve the chain of dynastic succession , and to justly enforce pet leashing regulations and the one vehicle on street parking rule . "
