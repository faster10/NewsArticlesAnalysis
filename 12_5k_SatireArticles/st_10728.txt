Anyone who ' s lived in NYC for a long time knows about the problem with ground water around the WTC site . When they were building the towers back in the 70 ' s , engineers could barely keep up with flooding , despite having giant pumps running 24 7 . I remember this , as I used to jog daily from Houston St to Battery Park every evening on the old West Side Hwy , after they closed it to traffic . I watched the towers going up .
