More evidence of McCain ' s miserable personality shines through in his hogging the TV cameras again ( OH GOD WILL IT NEVER STOP ? ! ) when he lashed out about the Feb . 1st Super Bowl just a few days before the big game . The NFL didn ' t put a " cloud " over the Super Bowl , you did , you gnarly nosed ratfink ! Why did you have to put your 2 1 2 cents in about the greatest event in the history of the world , Ebenezer McCain ? Why couldn ' t you have waited until Feb . 2nd for your Super Bowl Sunday black mass sermon in the landfill dump concerning the NFL , you hideous Scrooge ? For all we know , Johnny Boy , you might have had something to do with that very strange ending of the Patriots Seahawks game . You ' re very capable of pulling off such a set of stunts !
