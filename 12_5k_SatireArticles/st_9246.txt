" I just want to now take this time to cut through al the gossip I ' ve been hearing about and announce that there is only one possible candidate for the new First Lady , and that ' s my wife Laura .

" I know Laura will do an honourable job as First Lady and I have faith that she will be a great asset to my administration for years to come . "
