" While in Europe , I learned that this is one of the favorite animals of all of the children over there . They are in toy stores and candy stores and on clothing and bedsheets and school supplies . They even have cartoons about them on television . However , when I look at our National Zoo , I don ' t see this animal or any of it ' s relatives ( Gummi snakes , gummi worms , etc . ) . I think that we need to remember our Western European allies and set up a Gummi Bear Display at the National Zoo ! "
