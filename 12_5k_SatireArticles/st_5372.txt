" Parents naturally want to provide for their children ' s future , and today they are increasingly aware of how much they will need to pay when their child enters unemployment , " said economist Belinda Sayers , the report ' s lead author , who noted that the average cost of a year of joblessness was steadily rising , adding that families with two , three , or more kids had to put even more aside for helping multiple children through unemployment . " The expenses really add up housing , meals and young people often stay jobless for two years , four years , and sometimes even longer . That ' s a large burden on their parents . "
