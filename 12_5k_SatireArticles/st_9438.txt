When I further reminded them that Zimmerman had been acquitted of murder by a jury of his peers , because the way our justice system works is that you are innocent until proven guilty . Or it ' s supposed to anyway . . . And that obviously the jurors found that Zimmerman was in fear for his life , or couldn ' t , beyond a reasonable doubt , say that he wasn ' t in fear for his life , they threw bottles at me and called me a racist .
