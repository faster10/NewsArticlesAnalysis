Okay , I ' m done . Unless you ' d like to hear more about the fat cats on Wall Street . I can talk all day about Wall Street fat cats . My fans never get tired of it . They think I can do something about it . Let me tell you something , I hate to break this to my fans , because I ' ve got a lot of them and they ' re very nice people , but if I ever get elected they ' ll get rid of me faster than they got rid of JFK . That ' s just how it is . We have a nation run by special interests and big money . . . what , you ' ve heard that one before ?
