" I keep telling her we ' re doing fine , moneywise , " Bob said . " It ' s okay to spend a little to enjoy a nice night out at a restaurant . She ' ll agree to eat out , but then eventually , at some point in the evening , she ' ll say , ' You think it ' s worth paying 8 . 95 for a 2 plate of chicken fingers just to enjoy this d cor ? This place is nice , but it ' s not that nice . ' "
