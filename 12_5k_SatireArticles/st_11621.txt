Awards were given to some of the nominees while others did not receive awards , mostly for categories like Least Cancelled TV Show or Most Improved Canadian Actor or Best Corner Gas Rerun or some such thing however , this remains difficult to confirm . The host was either Gordon Pinsent or Don McKellar or Mary Walsh or another Canadian media personality whose name people kind of recognize . Winners went home with a Canadian Screen Award trophy , probably called a Screeny or a CanScr or something similarly cloying . At least one actor from Schitt ' s Creek was there , maybe more .
