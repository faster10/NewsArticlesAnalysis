You know why I did that ? I did that so ' s my taco would not GIT too loose ! Or , at least , any looser ' n it already is , due to Kevin and that unfortunate lack o ' judgment what I demonstrated with my five cousins when I was thirteen . I still gotta make a livin ' and there ain ' t no way I ' m gonna ruin one of my chief assets . Poor thang ' s already tired as it is . Looks like I got a pair of mudflaps goin ' on down there , y ' all ! Show a girl some sympathy . I need me some of them HoTox injections , or a rubber band , or somethin ' .
