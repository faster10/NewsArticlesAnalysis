A hunchbacked academic philosopher , Joseph Bitterman , is also perplexed by Miss Prettysweet . " The mystery , " he says , " is how anyone could willingly surrender such a natural advantage for so paltry a reward as philosophical insight . Beauty earns you tangible goods such as success in all your endeavours , whereas philosophy is just consolation for the downtrodden . If you ' re not in dire straits , you ' ve no need for consolation . However , if you learn the dark philosophical truths , pretty soon you will find yourself miserable and then you ' ll need more and more philosophy . So you ' ll have entered the trap , but you ' ll have done it to yourself . Why would anyone do that ? "
