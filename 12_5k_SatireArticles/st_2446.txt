" I ' ve heard some pretty stupid shit in my time , but that has to take the cake , " said Dr Anderson Hunt , the attending physician . " Why would any kid think he could fire plastic missiles up his nose and expect them to come out his belly button ? There ' s no point in feeling bad about this child ' s demise , because the deck was obviously stacked against him from the start . What we should feel bad about is the fact that because of him , millions of other children will no longer get to fire the RoboFighter ' s super cool Devastator Missiles or soak their friends with its FunFoam WaterBlasters .
