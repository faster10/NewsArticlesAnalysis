Other law enforcement and political figures whose names we ' ve declined to print were warned by the FBI about their appearance on the website . Our crack team of investigators went through the site and found over Two Hundred CrowdHits out on political figures just in the US . Some hits had already taken in tens of thousands of dollars and the contractors had already accepted the jobs . Other CrowdHits had not collected much money at all , like the one out on a popular comedian in Las Vegas , which has only collected a few hundred dollars , and seemed to have little chance of being picked up anytime soon . A few hits , especially on unpopular political figures , continued to rake in donations even after the contract had been accepted , but not yet completed .
