Clothing is excluded from being worn in UK pools now , with the exclusion of clothing specifically designed for swimming , and pyjamas when worn to retrieve a rubber brick from the bottom of the pool . Controversially , this rule applies to turbans and burkas . Boats are also excluded , but only if they have an outboard motor . A long list of diseases , including haemophilia , aids and STDs , will now be disallowed at pools , and people found lying about their infection will be barred for life from pools . Rather unnecessarily , all indoor pools are to prohibit driving .
