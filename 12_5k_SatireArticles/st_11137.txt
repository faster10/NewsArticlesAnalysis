A handout from the Volunteer Workers ' Union stated " What people do as a volunteer , and how they do it , is their choice . They don ' t have to tolerate lack of approval , dominance or other problems from the people they choose to work with . If they aren ' t happy at their workplace then they have the right to withdraw their labour whenever they like . No one can force them to do volunteer work in a place where they aren ' t happy . " However , a number of managers have lately been laying down the law and seeking to dominate volunteers , who say they are sick and tired of being treated like ordinary workers .
