The caller , known only as Bud suggested on Larry King Live that simply moving people around will help . Bud thinks that there are swathes of people who actually like to live and bathe in oils of any sort and he listed Texans , Alaskans , the Clampetts of Beverly Hills and anyone from the oil rich Arab countries e . g . Dubai , Iran , etc . He also suggested that people who had never seen the sea and therefore wouldn ' t know how it looked ' pre Spulf ' could be persuaded to move to the Gulf of Mexico and Florida coast none the wiser .
