We were out to dinner at a fancy restaurant on the one night in three months that we were able to be alone with each other , and we were both sniping and making backhanded comments the whole time spaced between long awkward silences .

It was that moment where I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him in holy alimony . "
