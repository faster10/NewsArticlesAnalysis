Another White House incident occurred in the second year of the Obama administration . In that attack Bin Laden gave President Barrack Obama a wedgie while he was leaving the White House . After Obama got his underwear un bunched he turned around to the three secret service agents who were walking behind him and demanded to know who did it . The agent in the middle was pointed out by both agents that were on either side of him . Needless to say , the middle agent received a big wedgie , back , from Obama .
