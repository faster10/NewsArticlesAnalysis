Anthony Gerard Brainard , Site Manager of Cryan Estates , reminisced about Mrs Voortface ' s tenure in the condominium : " She ' s run so many good people out of the building it would make your head spin that is if it spun round without making too much noise . She doesn ' t suffer anyone who talks above a whisper . There were the Ackerman ' s : they chewed with their mouths open . There were the Kinsley ' s : they had a popcorn maker . There were the Brett ' s : they had a tiny little hamster that went round and round in that infernal wheel . There were the Macklin ' s : their grandkids had a lot of those pull string dolls ya know , Chatty Cathy , Sister Small Talk and Mrs Beasly . There were the Paul ' s : he had an oxygen machine . And there were Loudermilks : they were deaf mutes , but she didn ' t like them from the get go . "
