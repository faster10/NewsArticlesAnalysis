The President expressed a twinge of regret that he had not been able to jump a subway turnstile while he was in New York City for the Republican National Convention . " I ' ve heard that that ' s a real fun thing to do , and I encourage it , because it shows gumption and spirit , " Mr Bush concluded . " And maybe if Howard Dean had jumped a few more turnstiles when he was a medical student , instead of studying for his boards , he might have grown a little taller and thus had more of a chance to win the Democratic primary .
