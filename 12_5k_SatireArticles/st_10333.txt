Garren says he ' s not exactly sure what prompted the attack , but thinks his squirrel call may have provoked it . Call it a talent or a curse , Garren apparently has a history of freak attacks that didn ' t start until he was discharged from the military due to the injuries he sustained . Almost 4 months ago , he was on a date at IHOPS and wanted to impress her with his whale call . She feigned amusement , but that abruptly ended after a 40 foot humpback whale crashed through the ceiling and crushed her . Garren wasn ' t charged with her untimely demise due to its incredulous improbability , but now after the squirrel incident law enforcement officials have begun scratching their heads .
