The yearly festival , which runs for the nine days leading up to Halloween , features lantern guided tours from government officials dressed as one of the nation ' s putrefying Festering Fathers , and includes dozens of activities for children , including bobbing for apples in the Reflecting Pool and a contest to guess the number of candy corns packed inside the Washington Monument . In addition to viewing the 535 terrifying jack o ' lanterns on the Capitol steps that are carved in the likenesses of all sitting congressmen , visitors can reportedly take hair raising hayrides along the Potomac , which is dyed blood red , or have their picture taken in front of the Supreme Corpse .
