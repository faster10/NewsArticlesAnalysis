" I can ' t help it , " Rosenblatt said . " Even when I close my eyes at night , I feel myself deconstructing things in my dreams random stuff like that two hour Dukes Of Hazzard reunion special or the Andy Warhol postage stamp or commercials for that new squeezable gel deodorant . I ' d say I ' m going crazy , but that presupposes an artificial barrier between societally preexisting concepts of ' sanity ' and ' insanity ' which themselves represent another false dichotomy maintained for the preservation of certain entrenched elements of the status quo and . . . Oh , God . I ' m doing it again . "
