Then , in a start , I wake up from my best sleep ever with a smile on my face . No one knows why . I actually believed this BS and it took a while for me to realize that it was just a cruel pizza induced dream . I find myself again in that familiar large room with no furniture or windows and the nice padding on the walls and floors . I do remember now . I slowly crawl to my favorite place in the corner and begin staring at that spot , that spot , that spot . . . . .
