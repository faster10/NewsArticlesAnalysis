The remainder of the evening was packed with incident , and saw an enraged Jose Mourhino ejected from the arena for heckling , as he continued to shout ' bullshit ! ' and ' big lies from the man with the roubles ' , despite warnings that he should stay quiet . He was joined in the hotel bar some minutes later by Manchester Uited boss , Lord Alex Ferguson , and a sobbing Cristiano Ronaldo , the 2 1 favourite to scoop the prestigious award . Ronaldo dramatically tore up his acceptance speech , declared himself as ' not understanding ' , then went to join the still weeping John Terry for a few bottles of champagne .
