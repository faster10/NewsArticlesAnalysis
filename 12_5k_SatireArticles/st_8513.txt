We asked the Club ' s official Head of Stationary , David Stapleton , to comment on these damning revelations , and he responded : " We are all very concerned about these recent developments . As little as three weeks ago , our records showed a perfectly healthy stock level of these envelopes , and yet as I speak to you now , the vast majority of these vital elements of our business remain missing and unaccounted for . How am I supposed to run a stationary department with only three brown envelopes ! ? "
