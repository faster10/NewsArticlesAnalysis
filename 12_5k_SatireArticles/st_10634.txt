Scientists say citizens will have a window of about three months , perhaps slightly more , to make plans and move . Japan and China have offered to accommodate up to 5 million Americans each , while Europe is expected to house about 20 million . This leaves about 40 million still in need of relocation , and it is thought these people will split evenly between the West and East Coast , with up to an additional million setting up a new life in Alaska . Scientists continue to monitor the situation , and hope to have more detailed analyses and eruption forecasts in the near future .
