" You never know what life is going to bring , " said Kroll , whose lone brush with the law was a 1994 speeding ticket . " I could find someone sleeping with my wife and , in a psychotic state of shock , kill him . Or I could accidentally hit somebody with my car and then flee the scene in panic . Or I could forget to report some major source of income and get nailed for tax evasion . It ' s not inconceivable . There ' s nothing wrong with thinking ahead . "
