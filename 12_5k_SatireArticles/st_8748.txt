" Several years ago , " said Jenn Darme , head of the serious stationary theft division of Fylde constabulary , " there was a serious theft of an entire pen museum by this miscreant . We had hoped that he would surface when the pens were attempted to be sold , or melted down . However , we now suspect that the pens are a trophy , and will never see the light of day again . This is a shame , as some of the pens are worth nearly a quid . "
