We tried to reach CBS headquarters regarding this legal matter , but they have so far not returned our calls . However , we did discuss this case with a representative from Hollywood law firm Gurney Chaser , experts in Worker ' s Compensation claims . Their opinion was that the judge would have to decide this case based upon what level of work falls under the worker ' s Compensation laws . Is only simple , paid labor covered or is the normally white collar application of outside the jobsite R D covered as well ?
