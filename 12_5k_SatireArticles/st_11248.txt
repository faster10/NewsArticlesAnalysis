Last month the American military offended the sect by attempting to win the hearts and minds of " The Beaters of the Bushes " with a series of special offers . In return for allowing an American cable TV company to install cable television to their homes and to local Mosques , each of the sect ' s members was to receive a year ' s supply of men ' s toiletries , including shaving cream , after shave lotion and a large shaving brush . A misunderstanding arose over the brand name on the shaving brush " George Washington Brush Company " when the sect ' s leader , Ayatollah Ali al Mustafa , based upon a mis reading of " George Washington Brush " , interpreted the toiletries as being a personal and religious insult from the President of the United States of America himself , the sworn enemy of the sect .
