The Department of Homeland security has targeted the initial boats to be eliminated by preemptive strike and released the photo shown above . The U . S . Navy has moved 4 nuclear powered submarines into the Great Lakes under code name " Ethan Allen " to intercept and destroy the small boats that will attempt to bring the illegal voters into the U .
