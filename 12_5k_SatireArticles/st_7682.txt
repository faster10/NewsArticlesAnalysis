" I originally read for the part of Rod Flanders , " Nelson says . " They looked at me and said ' We ' ve got our bully . ' instead . Dolph , Kearney and Jimbo has already been cast , but they wanted a leader for the gang . Kearney was the first choice , but they said he was too tall . I don ' t know why . They put me in the shorts and vest , taught me how to throw a punch and , whammo , I was Nelson Muntz , bully at large . "
