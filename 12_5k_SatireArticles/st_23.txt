" Everywhere you looked , snakes were lashing out and biting people . I saw a man get bit in his calf , reach down to grab his leg , get bit in his face by another snake , fall down , and then get bit several more times on the top of his head , " said Graham Rossini , the Diamondbacks ' director of Special Projects and Fan Experience . " It ' s weird because they were such beautiful snakes , too . I think the problem was that we gave out a lot of older rattlesnakes , and apparently they can deliver much more venom . "
