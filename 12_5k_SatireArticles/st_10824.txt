Dr Ottick explained that mathematicians assert the existence of a continuous unbroken number line , with numbers getting progressively larger , but that the evidence for the existence of such a line was sketchy , at best . " There are tons of missing transitional numbers . Has anybody ever found a number between 2 . 718281 and 2 . 718282 ? If they have , I ' ve never seen it . And that ' s just one example I can give you an uncountable infinity of others . "
