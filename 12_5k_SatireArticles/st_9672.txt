In the first enforcement of the " no car " law , police arrested Manuel Transmission , for driving his 1986 Toyota Crapola on Hollywood Boulevard during rush hour . According to police , Mr Transmission had no license , no registration , no address and spoke no English . His legal residency status was not questioned , as per local and federal law enforcement practices . His car was impounded and then immediately released under the imaginary Illegal Immigrants Rights Act . Manuel Transmission was later released , with sincere apologies from the L . A . city council for being racist and anti immigration .
