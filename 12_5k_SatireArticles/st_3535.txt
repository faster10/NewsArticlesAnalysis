" I ' d been asking for a new mop head for what seemed like forever . They kept saying they ' d order it , but then they never would , " Akers said . " It really gets kind of gross when you have to keep using the same mop head over and over . So when I showed up for work Monday and my manager said , ' Hey Cory , merry Christmas ! ' and tossed me the new head , I could hardly believe my eyes . There it was , a brand new , snow white , virginal mop head , unsoiled by grease or dirt . I was in heaven . At long last , the new mop head I ' d been dreaming of was in my hands . "
