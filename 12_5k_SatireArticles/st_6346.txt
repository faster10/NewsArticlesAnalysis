" We strongly advise all Americans to remain indoors between 3 : 00 and 3 : 30 p . m . , huddle close together with their loved ones , and sit still and stay completely silent unless it ' s a commercial , " Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said during a live television address this morning . " In fact , we recommend you be fully prepared by 2 : 58 , so you don ' t miss the part in the beginning where Danny , Uncle Joey , and the rest of the gang talk like surfers . "
