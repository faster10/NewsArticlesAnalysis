" You will enjoy working here enormously . And what branch of MI5 did you say you worked in ? I have a great many friends and cousins working there . And . . . forgive my absent mindedness . . . may I ask to which Lodge you intimated you belonged ? That ' s a portrait of my great ancestor Lord Constantine Douglas Mackenzie of the Scottish Rite who virtually established the opium trade in the East Indies single handedly , . . . looking as if he were alive . A fine work . Painted by a pupil of Sir Joshua Reynolds . Wonderful use of blue don ' t you think ? Maggie Thatcher wanted to buy it from me . . . but then Maggie thought she could buy everything . I visit his mansion often just outside Edinburgh whenever I call by to see our good friend Joanne Rowling . Wonderful man , Lord Constantine . Yes , now where were we ? "
