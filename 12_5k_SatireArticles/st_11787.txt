Mr Steeger showed great leadership by immediately visiting Jerry ' s widow to personally inform her of the loss , and that it was Jerry ' s fault for standing there like a faggot in the first place , so it was her legal her responsibility to take his place in the factory after she cleaned up the mess her damn fool of husband had left us . She didn ' t want to do it at first , but he convinced her alright . Boy did he ever , " said Albert Grower , who said he ' s now only 100 years away from retirement .
