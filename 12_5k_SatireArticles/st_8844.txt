Speaking in Birmingham earlier today , and wearing a protective shower cap , David Cameron said , " The time has come to properly confront the radical ideology of Seagullist extremists here at home . We must do more to prevent the radicalisation of young Seagullims . We must also root out the radical nests and the leaders of these nests . We know most Seagullims are peaceful individuals with no intention of randomly attacking the top of peoples heads and defecating on shoulders , but , there are a few bad eggs . We need to crush these eggs before they hatch . The integration of British Seagullims is also an issue we are looking closely at . "
