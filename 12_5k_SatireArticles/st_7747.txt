Interviewed at his palatial 6 , 500 square foot brick dog house in Beverly Hills , Scooby snarfed scooby snacks and slurped water from his 24k gold toilet , seemingly unaffected by the typical Peter Pan syndrome that normally strikes bachelors shortly before their wedding day . When asked what attracted him to Velma , of all people , Scooby merely pointed to his 500 cubic foot box of scooby snacks , piped " Rooby Dooby Doo " , played dead and shook everyone ' s hand . He then proceeded to laugh uncontrollably before spending the rest of the interview session licking his privates .
