Whether Yankovic can live up to the pressure remains to be seen . Like any great artist , he ' s had his share of failures , from the commercial belly flop of the 1986 album Polka Party ! to the lukewarm critical reception afforded his 1989 film UHF . But through it all , he has always come back fighting . A true gadfly , his goofy nasal voice and ferocious accordion solos serve as a Greek chorus to the hypocrisies and excesses of our age . One thing is certain : Whatever happens , " Weird Al " isn ' t going away . His voice will not be silenced .
