Pip ' s Partner , Pop has recently been arrested and charged for throwing a telephone at an employee of the hotel he was staying at . It is claimed that Pop was trying to call his ' mother ' from the hotel room , but he had no dial tone . He was very irate so he decided to walk downstairs to the help desk and threw a phone at the concierge . Pop ' s publicist refused to give any comment on the issue , only saying that the issue is being resolved . The signs aren ' t too good for pop as he was recently arrested for exposing himself to a group of women in a L . A nightclub , and while he was being taken out of the club by security he started throwing punches screaming " you ' re gonna pay for this you pack of Cu ' s ! "
