When asked how long he had been involved in the gay lifestyle , WInnie replied : " I guess it was when I would meet the other bears for our honey hunts and log rollings . Boo Boo would always share his picnic basket with me . We sort of discovered love and each other and everything together . He ' s been gone for many years , but I still miss his sweet smile and good nature . Yogi , Cindy , and Mr Ranger knew about our lifestyle for years and kept everything quiet . "
