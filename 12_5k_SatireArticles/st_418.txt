" From about 1972 to 1978 , I had Lidsville nightmares pretty much every night , " Meijer said . " In one of the more frequent ones , I ' d go downstairs for breakfast , but my mother wouldn ' t be in the kitchen . Instead , that cone shaped party hat with the giggly voice would be there , as though she had replaced my mother . I also had a lot of dreams where the football helmet locks me in a cage and pushes it into the ocean . And , needless to say , I often dreamed I was falling into the giant hat in the opening credits . "
