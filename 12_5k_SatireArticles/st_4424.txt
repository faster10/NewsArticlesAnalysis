" I don ' t pay my taxes so some suit in Washington can get on national television and call me a clown , " said Bobbie Lee , a 35 year old mechanic from Detroit . " Those Kerry ads piss me off so bad . So what if my teeth are stained ? So what if I do wear sweatsocks ? Everyone I show the videotape to gets just as mad . Just who does Kerry think he is ? Before last week , I didn ' t even know his name . "
