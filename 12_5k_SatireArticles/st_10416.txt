We talked to him . He told me , " Hating Bush was just an act . We ' ve been planning this for a long time . Years even . Bush got into office , found it to be a lot more work then he anticipated . We made a deal that I would run the next term . However we wanted it to stay out of public eye . My fellow republicans said I had to act like I hated Bush so them Demies wouldn ' t see it coming . Anyway I really do feel that I can shape this nation that Bush so wonderfully tore down . "
