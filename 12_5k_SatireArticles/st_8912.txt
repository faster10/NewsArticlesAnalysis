Everyone has been moaning about the testing of drugs and cosmetics on animals and quite frankly I ' m tired of hearing all these protests . I think Spaniels quite enjoy wearing eye shadow but that ' s beside the point . With my government in power I ' ll hopefully be able to increase overall Scottish employment to 80 90 . The increasing desperation from people trying to feed their families ( syncing up nicely with the fact I ' ll gradually reduce all unemployment benefits to the point of nothing ) will force them to seek new avenues of employment . A new readymade and willing ( so the dam animal rights mob can back off ) workforce to be tested on .
