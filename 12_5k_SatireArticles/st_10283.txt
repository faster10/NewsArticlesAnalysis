" Senator Clinton ' s going to lose this sucker , " said Cypher . " Ok , we know that . But a partial and biased ruling in her favor by the DNC would allow her to lose with . . . well , not dignity exactly , but with some measure of deluded self respect for losing by less than she is now . If you had nothing to go home to but some priapic jag off of a husband who ends every day by singing , " I was president and you ain ' t gonna be , nanny nanny boo boo , stick your head in doo doo , " you would be fighting for every vote , too . "
