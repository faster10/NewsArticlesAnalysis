" I was trying to get comfortable in my seat when Meyers launched into this whole thing about how I should avoid those U shaped neck pillows , " Helsing said . " When I told him I didn ' t know what he was talking about , he showed me one in the SkyMall catalog and explained that they cramp your neck worse than the regular airline pillow or a folded up blanket . I wasn ' t about to use one , but he felt the need to warn me , anyway . "
