" Ultimately , there ' s no answer to this that will leave everyone 100 percent satisfied , " the extremist said . " On one side of the coin , you have totally normal , everyday people who are in no way a threat to national security , and they are understandably uncomfortable with the government or anyone else for that matter being privy to their personal information , But on the other side of that coin , you have people like me , who are planning to strategically attack various cities and towns across the country in an ongoing effort to spread fear and promote radical agendas . Now , should those everyday Americans give up some of their freedoms in order to thwart such plans ? And if so , how much of their freedoms should they be be forced to give up to that end ? And yet another good question arises there : What are the exact bounds of the ' Blessings of Liberty ' guaranteed in the preamble of the U . S . Constitution ? And must those freedoms be altered somewhat in order to adapt to the modern world we live in now , which , as I ' m sure anyone would agree , is far different from 1787 when that document was originally adopted ? I suppose the ultimate question is , ' Where do you draw the line ? ' To be perfectly frank , I don ' t have the answer to that , and I would even hazard to say that a definitely ' right ' or ' wrong ' answer does not in fact exist . "
