There were , of course , other entertainments . The centre piece of the dining room was a specially erected wire descending stunt machine , like the ones diamond thieves use to steal priceless diamonds from museums . The machine came complete with a table and a perspex box containing an envelope , and everyone got to have a go at being lowered from the ceiling to steal the envelope from its box . Everyone clapped and cheered . " There was such a great atmosphere " Said another well known Tory , " But obviously I ' ll deny I enjoyed if any poor people get to see the video . Don ' t want to lose any votes now , do I ? "
