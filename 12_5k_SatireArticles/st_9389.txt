" I ' m going to have a full scale Gotham City Hall where I can play Batman , and I ' ll be receiving the keys to the city one day , and I ' ll have a few buddies of mine from high school come out and play , like , the Joker or the Riddler or the Penguin , " he said with some excitement . " They ' ll break up the ceremony , and then we ' ll fight it out . Not real fighting , you know . Fake stuff , like all of that MMA crap on the Superstation . And parkour . There will be plenty of parkour . Batman is real big into parkour these days . Then , I ' ll throw them in my Batmobile , and I ' ll haul them back to my Batcave , and I ' ll burn them with a propane torch for all of those times they made fun of me for my lisp back in high school . Just like Batman would do . "
