To the streetcar driver with the pony tail : Yoooooo girl , you workin ' ? Mmm , yeah , I got the fare , but don ' t worry about that transfer , I ain ' t goin ' anywhere , I ' m staying right here wit ' you , beautiful . What ' s that ? Oh , I can ' t stand here ? You want to put a little white line between you and me ? Ohh , I get it you ' re on this side , and I ' m on " that side . I ' ve got to stay bottled up all hot under the collar back with the other lowly peasant creatures , while you ' re up here on your rocket throne , drunk on your own streetpower . You little transit hooker . You love that bros like me need a pony tail like you just to get home in time for Glee , don ' t you ? You ' re playing like without you , my point A doesn ' t have a point B and that makes you special . You think wearing that uniform makes you better than me ? You think you untouchable ? Well this just in , pony : you can honk the horn , you can brake real soft , but everybody wants that shirt off .
