Even though we only see the show as something to laugh about , it is clear that Marge suffers from clinical depression ! I mean , who wouldn ' t suffer from one or more emotional disorders after years of tolerating an idiot like Homer , a wanna be " Billy Bad Ass " like Bart , and Lisa , a young who thinks she knows it all at the tender age of eight ! Marge is simply caught up in world of dashed hopes and dreams . And to make things worse , she actually tried to find outlets by being a substitute teacher , real estate agent , law enforcement officer , among other careers and outlets that just did not work .
