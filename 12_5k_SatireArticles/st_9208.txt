" What can I say ? Tough times taught me a lot about myself . That I ' m willing to forsake all my moral principles and take a crappy job at a planet killing corporation in order to pay the rent . But I do still believe in doing work that contributes to the well being of everyone in the universe . I haven ' t lost sight of that . Well , okay , maybe it ' s out of sight , but not out of mind .
