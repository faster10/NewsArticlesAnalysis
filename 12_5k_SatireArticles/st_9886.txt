The FBI invited me , Sierra Paylin , and other buxom politicians to try on some mock ups of explosive vests . Not one of us could manage to zip them up . Personally , I was afraid that my industrial duty beauties would get squooshed out around my armpits , so I didn ' t even try . Sorry if I disappointed the young FBI interns who were photographing the event ! "
