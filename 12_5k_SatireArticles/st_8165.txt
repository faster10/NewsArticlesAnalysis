To you and I , dear reader , this may seem hard to believe , but only the brain is required for the continued coherence of an individual . Therefore the fundamental state of being shall be for a brain to be docked with a communal fuelling station , where its vessels shall be circulated with a scientifically perfect nutrient soup . To prevent unpleasant phantom limb sensations , the nervous system socket shall be sent a signal equivalent to that provided with a perfectly restful comfortable body and the blood circulating through the brain shall be cleansed and nourished by a shared set of internal organs .
