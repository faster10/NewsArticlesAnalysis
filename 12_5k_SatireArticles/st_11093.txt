And how ' s about this one : Holding a limited conventional war to prove the dangers and horrors of a full scale world war ? Money could be made by people betting on which side would win say the guys wearing the orange shirts versus the folks wearing the pink jerseys . All the betting would be part of a federally sanctioned lottery , of course , with Autotote tickets sold , like the ones they use at horse and dog racing facilities . Daily bets could be wagered on an army taking a hill , valley , or river bend . Which will win , the orange shirts or pink shirts ? Micro bets could be made on favorite war heroes and if they ' ll survive a battle or skirmish , and if so , how many of their adversaries will they maim ? How many will they kill ? Exactas even perfectas and superfectas could be contrived around this sort of stuff . Both opposing armies would be equipped with all the latest high tech military weapons and all the major TV stations , along with sundry cable affiliates , would certainly cover such a spectacular in full force . Tee shirt companies would be able to capitalize on selling the orange and red tee shirts to fans of the two armies . Everyone in the world would have a favorite team , right ? If the war lasted for months , maybe even years , just think of all the big bucks that could be made ? All the dead bodies would be proof positive that yes , shooting highly advanced military weapons at each other can indeed kill . Sound familiar ?
