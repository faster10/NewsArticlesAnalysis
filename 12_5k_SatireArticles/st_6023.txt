" Slumps are as mysterious as they are tough , " said Dale Gregory , Duke university ' s director of sports studies . " The problem sports has now is not to become preoccupied and anxious , not to obsess about what went wrong with Chad Ochocinco , not to get worked up about how Pacman Jones won ' t go away , not to fixate on Yao Ming ' s injury . Sports just has to relax and do what it does best . Have a Yankees Red Sox ALCS , maybe . People like that . "
