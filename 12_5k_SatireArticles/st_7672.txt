" Oh , my Kevin wanted to invite the Twilight Cast to end the Jonas Twilight feud . Zac Efron and Taylor Lautner had a flexing contest with my Kevin and then poor Kevin lost ! Well , turns out Taylors ' s ten pack won the contest so Zac got upset and tried to prove that High School Musical was better than Twilight and then someone insulted Vanessa Ann Hudgens and well , that was it ! Zac and Taylor were passed out and Kevin tried to break them up at one point and I think he got in the way . "
