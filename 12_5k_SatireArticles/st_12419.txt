Wanda Icebox , a woman cursed to spending the rest of her life covered by boils and in a wheelchair for not passing on a chain letter , saw what happened next from her porch . " The UFO stopped down at the crossroads and Elvis helped Princess Diana and one of those Roswell aliens climb on . The UFO then went straight up into the air and disappeared into the clouds . I wheeled over to the place where he had landed and saw an image of the Virgin Mary burned into the grass . When my toes touched one of the burn marks , all the boils on that leg just disappeared . It was a miracle . "
