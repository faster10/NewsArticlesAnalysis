Winston is reputed to have used these three one liners most and the US President Eleanor D . Roosevelt loved hearing them spoken time and again especially in the presence of Stalin . At Yalta Stalin said he wanted to keep Poland and Winnie shouted ' My Arse ! ' , which caused Roosevelt to have an asthma attack after a fit of giggles . Stalin didn ' t see the funny side of Winston ' s camp cry of ' I ' m Free ! ' in response to the Russian ' s boast of owning Europe . Again the US premier had to be given urgent medical treatment . Even Homer Simpson ' s famous wail , ' D ' oh ! ' was first expressed by a frustrated Churchill when informed of the route of the British Expeditionary force by the Germans . Churchill recorded all his quips in the jotters later that day while writing his diary .
