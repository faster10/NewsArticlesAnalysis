" I read in The Roman Enquirer that people are suddenly seeing images of my face in tacos and on toast . It ' s preposterous . With these Popeparazzi sculptors cranking out statues of me does anybody but me remember God ' s ban on graven images ? the next thing you know these Madonna figurines will start bleeding or something goofy . What ' s next , t shirts of me with Jesus as a baby that read Like A Virgin ' or worse , Who ' s That Girl ? ' ? "
