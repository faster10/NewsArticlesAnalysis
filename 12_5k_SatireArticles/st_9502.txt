Logic also states that primitive life in the universe that is 2 million years ahead of us do have the capabilities in the form of advanced technologies to harm humans because those type of life forms are intelligent and they are controlled by primitive emotions and primitive thought patterns because their brains are not highly evolved . In " YouTube " there is a video of a dog , that was being video recorded by it ' s owner , acting extremely bizarre like it was possessed . Bieber quickly realized that the dog was being controlled by primitive technologies of a primitive race of alien life forms probably somewhere in our Milky Way galaxy . The control seemed more like a display to show that they exist . They could have performed the display away from the video camera , but their intentions were to be noticed . Life forms which are not emotionally and intellectually advanced would be the ones who would engage is such display . Their technologies are probably hundreds of times more advanced than their minds causing them to produce the effect seen on YouTube with the dog . Their actions are similar to the U . S . dropping nuclear bombs on Japan to test the results .
