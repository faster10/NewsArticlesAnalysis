" I only went to work today because I couldn ' t miss inventory , " Flemming said Tuesday morning . " I don ' t even remember getting home last night . I know I didn ' t drive , because my car wasn ' t around this morning . I guess I took a cab . Christ . Honestly , that ' s the last time I do that . Next time , I ' ll go to the bar and hang out , but I ' ll just have a soda . "
