" Right now , I ' m just barely getting by , working two 30 hour a week jobs without health insurance , " Joan said . " So , unfortunately , I can ' t buy the kids all the things I ' d like to . But hopefully , by the fall , I ' ll be getting enough hours at one of the jobs to be considered full time and get full health and dental . That ' d save us some money , especially with Brady ' s asthma medicine , and then maybe we could loosen the belt and buy some nice things . "
