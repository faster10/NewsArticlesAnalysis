" Last Friday , there was a big 50 Watt showcase over at The Crowbar featuring us , Spacegoat , The Hal Lindens , and a whole bunch of other cool bands from the label . The club ' s just a few blocks from the White House , and the cover was just 4 . We plastered flyers all over the kiosks up and down Pennsylvania Avenue , so there ' s no way the president couldn ' t have known about it , " Rudder said . " There ' s no excuse for him not being at that show . "
