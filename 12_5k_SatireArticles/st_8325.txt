This has been most apparent at Hull City , where owner Asem Allem tried to get his team name changed to Hull City Tigers . But of course his attempt failed , because he got the name wrong . He should have asked for the name to be changed to Hull City Tiggers , not Tigers . " Tiggers are very different from Tigers , " said Coach Stavros . " There ' s more of a bounce to them . And it ' s the bounce that wins the games . "
