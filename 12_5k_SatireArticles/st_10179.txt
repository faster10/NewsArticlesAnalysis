Ms . Anderson said that after the experience she ' ll probably be supporting somebody who has ' real ' hair . " I think I ' ll probably have to pay closer attention to Ron Paul or Fred Thompson . Ron Paul has a combover but his message is interesting . Fred doesn ' t have any hair so there ' s nothing to distract you . He should leave his wife at home though . Otherwise the males in his audience will just stare at her cleavage . I ' ve been told she ' s pretty hawt . "
