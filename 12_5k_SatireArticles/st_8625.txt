" They wanted the ball . We not give them the ball . When they come to challenge for the ball , our boys pass the ball to somebody else . We make them chase shadows . They not like , but it is football . We give them good spanking . Oh yes . We could have scored ten tonight , or even twelve , but our boys not want to play too hard , because now is holiday time . So we take it easy against Manchester . The football is coming home , yes ? Home to Catalunya . "
