On the drive home on that clear and cool September morning , I couldn ' t help but notice the faces of other drivers in cars alongside of me and at intersections as they patiently waited for lights to change and listened to their car radios in silence . Every face showing a detachment from the normal everyday affairs that usually filled their minds and hearts . Each had a stoic mask of disbelief , shock , horror on their faces . I guess mine too was that way as I sat looking around me .
