" A good solid terrorist attack will enable us to get back to shouting about " blitz spirit " and waving flags about and singing the national anthem . We will say it ' s a attack on all our British values ! Then the people will welcome the government prying into our emails and beg them to set up police checkpoints . They will never question why the NHS is underfunded , why the nation sustains on pay day loans and food banks . We will give them a enemy . A enemy that looks different to them a enemy they can easily hate all together . "
