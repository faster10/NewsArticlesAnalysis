A frustrated Verlander , who threw his second career no hitter last Saturday against the Toronto Blue Jays , said his parents Richard and Kathy had asked if he would be receiving some kind of promotion for his accomplishment , if this meant he would finally be allowed to hit during the games , if he would have received a promotion had he thrown a perfect game instead , why he " slacks off " and throws some pitches slower than others , and whether or not he needed any money .
