Herb is the longtime owner of The Jolly Miser tavern , a favorite haunt of local boozehounds and dead beats . He ' s seen some wild things between happy hour and last call , but nothing quite like this . " Our kitchen is open until 11pm daily , and we serve grain in many forms : sandwiches , bread bowls ah double decker sandwiches . Even though I handle bread daily , this has shaken me to the core . Maybe it foretells something big like , triple decker sandwich big "
