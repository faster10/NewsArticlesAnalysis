Bieber also argues that religion has used it ' s tax free money to create laws that violate the freedoms of the American people because they want to run the country under their religious view points . The religious temperance movement is one example of religion controlling law . Evangelical preachers of various Christian denominations denounced drinking alcohol as a sin and they claimed that people who drank lost their faith in God and ceased to observe the teachings of Jesus . The eighteenth amendment was put into place by religious control . What the founding fathers feared , when they conceptualized the separation of church and state , came to be during the temperance movement . Another example of religion controlling government is the Christian Coalition of America , a tax exempt corporation whose activist controlled Republican and Democratic politicians by turning out large blocs of votes for Religious Right candidates . Politicians voted as the Christian Coalition urged because they feared being listed on Voter guides as casting anti Christian votes . Bieber complains that there are all types of bizarre and extreme religions that are beginning to pull in tax free dollars and whose intentions are to control the people of the nation through legal influence .
