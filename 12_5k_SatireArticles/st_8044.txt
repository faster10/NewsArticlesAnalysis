" We have had numerous beings tell us that they would do anything to save their children the five minutes it takes to say that prayer and the lifetime of keeping up appearances that comes with it . We worked with our professors and drafted a set of questions that we ask each person who answers the call . One of the final questions is , ' Why did you answer the call today ? ' For bound Christians , every time the answer is the same : in order to try and save the world from being saved . "
