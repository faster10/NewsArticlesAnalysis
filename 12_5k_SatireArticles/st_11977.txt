The best was to see the only man not retired and no longer a Boston captain , dressed in his Celtic green . You guessed it : Paul Pierce returned to Boston , but he eschewed that ugly Washington Wizard uniform to wear a Sox cap with his Celtics jacket . You have to love the optimism in Boston . Fans haven ' t had much to buzz about lately and seeing Paul Pierce back here was a delight . It left us wondering why he isn ' t playing for the Celtics .
