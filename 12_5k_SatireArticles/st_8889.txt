' Research shows this to be one of the main reasons why Jeremy Corbyn is unelectable as Prime Minister , ' Professor Jung continued . ' No one ' s bothered about his plan to distribute open toed sandals and sing Kumbaya as an alternative to a national defence policy . Neither are people too concerned about an attitude to workers , management and welfare that became obsolete in the last century . The key problem is his dress sense . He began his leadership of the Labour Party with a sartorial style that might just have suited the Islington North branch of the Trainspotters Society . He then smartened up to a standard that might have got him into the CAMRA meeting next door . Prime Minister , though , definitely not .
