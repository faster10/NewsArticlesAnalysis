The group statement comes in response to an incident last week when a police detective entered Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago and requested church records in connection with a pending sex abuse lawsuit . The Church ' s pastor , Father Joseph O ' Shea , spoke at the conference , tearfully relating his tale of humiliation at the cruel and wanton hands of the detective in charge of the investigation . " Last week , I was preparing Sunday Mass when , without a word of warning , an agent of the law positively descended on me , insisting on seeing church documents , including my personal records and communications . For minute after excruciating minute , he attempted , in effect , to pin me down and examine me from all sides , internal and external . If a person can ' t see how egregious that is , there ' s something developmentally wrong with them . "
