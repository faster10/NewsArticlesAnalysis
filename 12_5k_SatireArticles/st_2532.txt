For in these troubled times of rising unemployment , political infighting , anger , and persecution , America needs a man who can put the issues in perspective and bring us comfort a man who cares not about race , creed , sexual orientation , or party affiliation a man who sees beyond petty political maneuverings , emotional exploitation , greed , and opportunism a man who encourages all of us to disregard the ceaseless clamor of ideologues and think for ourselves a man who sees beyond his own ego and cares only for what is good and right and just .
