In May 2007 , the San Francisco Chronicle reported that a student and two parents were attacked by a squirrel that crashed through the glass window of a San Jose elementary school classroom , beating a child into submission and taking off with one of the parents wallets . As of now , it is not known if these incidents are related but officials aren ' t taking anything for granted and have begun taking hand grenades and painting them to look like acorns to be sporadically sprinkled throughout the park in the name of justice and the American way .
