A July 24 posting read , " Just got back from a lunch with Colin and Adil Moussa ( one of Prince Saud al Faisal ' s guys ) . Colin wants the Saudis to send some troops to Najaf so some of the soldiers are Arab , I guess . This Moussa guy sure wears a lot of jewelry . A golden chain , a golden ring with his initials or something , and some other sparkling stuff kinda effeminate . Anyway , best of luck in Iraq , Iyad . "
