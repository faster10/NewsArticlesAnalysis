Under the terms of the agreement , Palestinians and Israelis will commit to " sharing together , side by side , a real and substantive presence " in the global foreign disaster based news media . The shared headline commitment extends to news about massacres throughout Israel and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip territories , and covers both the destruction of Palestinian homes by Israeli air to surface rocket attacks and the killing of Israeli women and children in suicide bombing campaigns by Palestinian extremists . Although foreign correspondents said they regarded the agreement as a step forward , they stressed that it is only the beginning .
