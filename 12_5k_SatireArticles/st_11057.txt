An impressive finale is planned for the event , in which all the wedding guests will be given parting gifts : among which will be a gold plated Ruger Varminter K1 rifle . And then as the couple bid a fond farewell and depart in their landau carriage handlers will sound a gong and release a hand selected crop of animals for the guests to pursue to their delight : grey wolves , polar bears , elk , black rhinos , mountain gorillas , Sumatran elephants and , for the children , leatherback turtles .
