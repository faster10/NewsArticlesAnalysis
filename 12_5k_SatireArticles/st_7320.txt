" Well I was travelling alone , taking in the sights of Las Vegas , playing the slots and a little blackjack , and I decided to go for a bite to eat . Somehow I wound up downtown , in a very seedy area , and happened along a tiny coffee shop where I bought a small coffee and a pre packaged danish . Having very little space to consume my purchases inside , I went along the boulevard a bit to find a few standup tables and approached a very attractive young lady at one of them and asked , politely of course , if it would be possible for me to share her table for just the amount of time it would take me to consume my comestibles . It was not until much later that I would discover that I was indeed talking to the mother of one of the younger generation ' s mega music superstars , none other than Justin Bieber . "
