The federal government has also gotten involved in this situation with economic threats against the Boy Scouts . Several scout camps , on National Forest lands , that had been leased to the organization at rental rates of one dollar per year have had those leases revoked . The Boy Scouts no longer have access to Scout Camps that they have developed and used for decades . Many areas have had to make the choice of charging more for camps or cancelling them altogether . Needless to say , attendance is down .
