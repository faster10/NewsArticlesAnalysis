" As their indifferent grandfather , I would feel an obligation to be part of their lives in the most insignificant way possible , " Rodriguez said . " I ' ll tell them how Grandpa , Pop Pop , or whatever it is kids call their grandfather , felt when he hit that bomb off of Carl Pavano in the division series . At least I assume they ' ll want to know that . I guess they might have other interests , but I ' m not really going to take the time to get to know who they are . For the short amount of time I plan on spending with them it wouldn ' t be worth it . "
