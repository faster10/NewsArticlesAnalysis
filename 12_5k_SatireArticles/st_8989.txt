" The Gospel according to John states clearly that in the beginning there was indeed ' the word ' . If one imagines the Universe at its inception as an infinitely condensed yet infinitely energetic point one can see its limitless potential . We are not sure exactly what caused that fatal cascade , the first fall of that quantum line of dominoes which caused the beginning of all creation we know as the word . I for one am quite open to the possibility that this is , was and shall be the bird . " ( Copyright : Stevie Hawkman . )
