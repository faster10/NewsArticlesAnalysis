" There is much to love about Brazil , " Costa said . " Our culture is a unique mixture of Native American , European , and African . Explore Brazil , and you will meet cowboys of Rio Grande do Sul , the vaqueriros to the Northeast , the women of Bahia in their traditional African dress , the Native Americans resplendent in ceremonial beads . There is also the nationalistic writings of Jos de Alencar , the art of Tarsila do Amaral , and our rich pageantry of music and dance , ranging from bumba meu boi to tropicalismo , sertanejo to capoeira .
