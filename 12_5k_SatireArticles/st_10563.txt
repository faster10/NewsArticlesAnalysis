" I stayed on the line , just listening to her , " Webb told the court in an emotional appeal . " I knowed sic it was wrong , but she had an angel ' s voice . She was talking to her friend about all the guys that done her and her little boy wrong . I could relate . I wanted to take her away from all that . It was just a fantasy , though , born out of my own pain . The whole time , I kept thinking , ' I need you more than want you , and I want you for all time . ' Could ' ve been anyone , you see ? I ' m just a very sad man these days , trying to make ends meet and find some sense in living . "
