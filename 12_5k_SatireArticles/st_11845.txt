The official policy is that I see you twice a year for a cleaning , but both of us know it ' s once at best . And that ' s fine , as long as you are responsible and floss at home . I know that you ' ll have other stuff to worry about , like getting your routine testing for hepatitis or HIV ( make sure they use clean needles when taking your blood ! ) , but I ' m sure you can always find a few minutes in your schedule to clean between your teeth . I mean , it ' s not like you ' re cleaning a dental office .
