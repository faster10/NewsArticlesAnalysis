" Romney has faced a lot of pressure during this campaign , but it ' s nothing compared to what he ' ll have to deal with if he ' s elected president , " said political analyst William Schneider of George Mason University . " Imagine him having to appear relatable in front of the media for four straight years , or having to meet one on one with hundreds of grieving victims of a tragic shooting or natural disaster . What will happen when he ' s directly and repeatedly confronted about his contradictory views on immigration , gun control , or same sex unions ? It could be disastrous . We could easily see Mitt Romney chuckling uncomfortably throughout his entire term . "
