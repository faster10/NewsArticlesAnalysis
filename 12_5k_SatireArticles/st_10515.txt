Overall though the tour is a real otherworldly spectacle , with the roar of the crowd rolling through the stadium every night as Michael sticks his hand out of packed dirt built into the stage floor , emerging as Vincent Price ' s voice is played from tape . Unfortunately , Michael ' s own voice is being played from tape as well . Right now he ' s working fastidiously with his vocal coach Afal Setti . " It ' s a problem of breathing , or more to the point , not breathing . "
