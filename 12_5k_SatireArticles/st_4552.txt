" I ' m reasonably sure that this ' Calvin Johnson ' fellow was up near the top , for instance . He ' s a wide receiver , though , and I ' m not sure I ' d rank a wide receiver first . And there ' s a young man named Okoye here whose name I remember 19 years old , though , can that be right ? Damn it , how could I do something so stupid ? "
