" I also made the most of good old American mechanics when it came to choosing my bicycles : none of that fancy French crap for me . I used a Huffy Classic single speed coaster on most of my Tour rides . On difficult legs , I would ride my Roadmaster with the big balloon tires . I could pump those suckers up a hill faster than any Frenchman no matter what he was riding and I was able to fix my own bike with an 8 " Crescent wrench and patch kit . The French might do better in their own race if they just bothered to take off those silly training wheels . "
