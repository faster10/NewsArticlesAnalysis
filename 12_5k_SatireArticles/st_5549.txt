" Look , for decades there wasn ' t a bigger Rocky Horror nut on the planet than me , " Piro said . " But my tastes have changed over time , and I ' ve got to be honest with myself : The Rocky Horror Picture Show is actually a pretty irritating movie , and the music , while admittedly catchy on first listen , really starts to grate over time . And dressing up like Dr Frank N Furter or Riff Raff and prancing around like an over caffeinated teenager doesn ' t make the movie any better , it just compounds everything that is already annoying about it .
