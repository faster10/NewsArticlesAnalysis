" Dublin is so amazingly cool me and Irish president Mary McAleese went shopping on Grafton Street , and we saw the Ha ' penny Bridge and the mummified bog guy at the National Museum , which was seriously freaky , " Albright said . " Then , at like 4 o ' clock , we started getting hungry and we were kind of tired from all the walking , so we stopped at this caf near Trinity College , where we met these two guys from Australia , John and Tony , who go to the University of Melbourne . They were really cool , especially Tony . Hopefully , if there ' s ever a diplomatic crisis in Australia , I ' ll get a chance to visit them . "
