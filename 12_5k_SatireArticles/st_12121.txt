It ' s not that these people are members of the Democratic party , it ' s that their liberal socialistic ideas never and haven ' t worked , but that they are so eager to ram it down all Americans throats . It ' s not that these people are who they are , it ' s the liberal victim groups they pander to , the " poor me " attitude , and the victim mentality they represent . Their inability to give a straight answer to an honest question . The hard earned tax dollars that they want to give to people who refuse to do anything for themselves .
