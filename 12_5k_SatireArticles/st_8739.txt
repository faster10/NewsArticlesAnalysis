AN MP has caused outrage by suggesting that high rates of diabetes in his Norfolk constituency , which has seen a growing number of cases among children , could be the result of residents inbreeding . Ian Gibson , a former chairman of the Commons Science and Technology Committee , made his remarks after it was disclosed that 345 children in Norfolk have type 1 diabetes more than double the 160 cases that would be expected for the size of the population . In the past three years doctors have treated 42 new cases of the condition among children , compared with a national average of 24 for a county the same size .
