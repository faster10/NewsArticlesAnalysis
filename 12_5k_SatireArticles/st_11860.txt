Greetings , fellow travellers down the night highway of the macabre . I , of course , am Derek Darklord , and You , of course , will recognize my name from the covers of your favourite spine tinglers , bone chillers and blood curdlers . Some of my more famous works include , " DeadWoman , " Spider ' s Ball and " Literal Blood Hound . No doubt these books have been the stuff of your nightmares , but have you ever wondered what , fair reader , is the stuff of which my nightmares are made ?
