" We think this is a great idea . Polar bears will soon have an ice passage all the way to London , Paris and several other major European capitals . We believe that closer proximity with the human population will sensitise many people to the plight of these pristine white creatures who are just so cute when they are small . We will soon be releasing a stuffed animal in form of a baby polar bear holding an air conditioning remote control . Be sure to buy one , proceeds will go to buying up cows to save them from becoming McDonald hamburgers . "
