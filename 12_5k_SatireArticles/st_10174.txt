Alex Jones , a radio personality who has defied the media blackout on Ron Paul , along with defying most everything else , was on the ground with his bullhorn , guiding in the initial wave of Freedom Fighters and directing the traffic throughout the entire operation . Through years of investigation , and his recent infiltration of the White House as an undercover page , Jones had learned that the security guards guarding the White House were private security guards hired from the Blackwater Security firm . Jones had also uncovered that Blackwater was subcontracting these guards from Arbusto Security , owned by George W . Bush ' s cousin , Edward " Bud " Bush . Arbusto Security has had legal problems in the past due to the hiring of illegal aliens and convicted felons . Jones passed this intelligence on to the Freedom Fighters , who successfully used it to take control of the White House without firing a shot . Rachel , who was part of the initial wave distracted the security guards inside the building by unzipping her coveralls , revealing her negligee clad figure , confirmed that many of the security guards could not speak English .
