" Last week , I made a little friendly joke about the dark hair on Gayle ' s upper lip by calling her Tom Selleck , " said Stuart Runnels , a fellow claims processor at Mid American Insurance . " You should ' ve seen her flip out . I was just kidding around , but she gets all deranged and says , ' I really don ' t think that was very funny at all , Stan . I don ' t make fun of your personal appearance . ' "
