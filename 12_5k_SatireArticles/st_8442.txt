Driving on Route 15 North which glides right above the Little League Complex , I have witnessed several swerving and unacceptable driving habits by Carolina inhabitants who are probably too distracted by their Petey Pablo album from the early 2000 ' s to pay attention to the road . Another , dangerous roadway situation is the larger groups here to support the Far East teams who get dumped off buy large tour busses and push across busy highways and streets as if being chased by a giant sea dwelling lizard . As some of them approach you they meet you quickly with the greeting " Ohayo " ( pronounced : Ohio ) sometimes us locals just want to scream in response " Yeah it ' s the next state over " as we gesture towards the West .
