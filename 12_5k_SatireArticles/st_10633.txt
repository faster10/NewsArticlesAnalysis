" What Gibbs is saying , is that in May of 1993 , Hillary Clinton wanted some friends to get the White House Travel Office all to themselves , and the first thing to do was fire the seven employees serving at the time by having the FBI indict them on charges of embezzlement and criminal conversion , based on innuendo and hearsay . Although a Not Guilty verdict was announced two years later , and investigators concluded that Hillary had made inappropriate statements that had to be knowingly false , the important thing to remember is THE CLINTONS GOT AWAY WITH IT . Therefore , in the DC mindset , Obama should get away with just as much , if not more . Look up White House travel office controversy , or TravelGate . "
