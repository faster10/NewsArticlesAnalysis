Jim DeMint , President of The Heritage Foundation stated that , " My winter home burned to the ground because of the drought in California , and my summer home in Texas just got washed away in all the flooding . The escalation of dangerous weather around the country has had some very direct consequences on me . If my organization wasn ' t reliant on funding from a major energy company I would be inclined to admit that something is going on with the weather , but I ' m not sure I would 100 state that climate change is real . "
