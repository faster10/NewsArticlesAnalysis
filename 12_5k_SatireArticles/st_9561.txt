Mr Garbanzo ' s lawyer insists that his client ' s case isn ' t frivolous . " We believe we have a case against pornographers , not because they ' re peddlers of smut . That was the old charge and that was just a matter of taste . No , our complaint is that , you know , it ' s enough already . They ' ve ruined sex for the next generation . These filmmakers knowingly flooded the market with sexual images that no one has the strength to resist . As a direct consequence , sex has become stale . "
