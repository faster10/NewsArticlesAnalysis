" Like all politicians in training I attended The Machiavelli School for Rapscallions . There I learned how to subdue my conscience , to see the horrors of the real world ever so clearly , and to keep those revelations a secret so I could smile and nod and shake hands with the best of them . I learned how to be cynical , to hold average people in contempt so that I could ignore how they think society should be run and I could fob off my talking points on them . "
