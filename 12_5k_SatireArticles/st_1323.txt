According to preliminary polling conducted by the CUA , the 108th Congress is vastly out of step with the American people . In a telephone poll , the CUA asked randomly selected citizens to list their most pressing goals . Of the top four , only one , " finding a job , " was discussed in Congress this session . The other three " getting something to eat , " " finding something to do , " and " maybe hanging out " have all been ignored by Washington lawmakers .
