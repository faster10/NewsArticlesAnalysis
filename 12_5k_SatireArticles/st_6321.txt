" It ' s going to be a damn travesty , " said the 31 year old All Pro , speaking to reporters months or even years before the hypothetical contract is drawn up . " A travesty . I ' m one of the best receivers in this league hell , after the incredible , record breaking season I ' m sure I ' ll have had when I sign this next contract , I might be the best ever . But I wouldn ' t go so far as to call this next contract the best ever . It ' s going to be an insult on the part of whichever team I eventually sign with , and they ' ll know it . I demand they give me what I really deserve . "
