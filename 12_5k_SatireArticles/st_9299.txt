Attorney General Eric Holder has notified Arizona that the Obama Administration will not enforce Federal Law in Arizona . While " Fast and Furious " sent more than 1400 weapons to Drug Cartels in Mexico , the US Department of " Justice " insists that every Mexican working for the Drug Cartels vote for Obama in the Arizona Presidential Election . Holder has sworn to block the deportation of up to 800 , 000 Mexicans voting for Obama , and if Arizona ' s electoral votes go to Romney , he will sell the state to Mexico for 23 Million while ballots are being recounted . This would nullify all votes cast for Romney in Arizona .
