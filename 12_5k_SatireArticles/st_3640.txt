" Once , we were hanging out at the mall when , out of nowhere , Tom bought me this remote controlled , gas powered miniature helicopter for my birthday , even though my birthday wasn ' t for another five months , " Ruzek friend Cris Harbaugh said . " We had a ton of fun flying it around the parking lot , buzzing cars and freaking people out until the mall security guy told us to leave . Tom got so worked up about getting busted , he filled the toy with M 80s and blew it up in midair right there in the outdoor food court . Man , what a great day that was . "
