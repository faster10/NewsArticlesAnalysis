Social scientists at UC Berkeley have a theory to explain what ' s happening . They call it assholization . It began long ago , they say , at the dawn of technology . Tools made us more efficient and powerful and that started turning our ancient ancestors into assholes . " It ' s largely just a matter of being corrupted by power , " says Dr Stanley Pishposh , the lead researcher at Berkeley studying this phenomenon . " At one point , long , long ago , we must have been settling disputes with just our fists . Then we invented the ax and those earliest ax users were perhaps the first full fledged assholes to walk the planet . They bullied those without axes , you see . Again , we used to have to run from here to there . Then we domesticated horses and you had the rise of the nobles who could afford them again , big time assholes , thanks to that advance in technology .
