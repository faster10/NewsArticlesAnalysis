" Harlem has a good team , " said Manning , who refused to respond to the Globetrotters ' taunts and was unable to think of any of his own . " For instance , I respect their ability to spin the football on their fingers instead of carrying it in the traditional way . But it ' s unfair for the refs to allow , for instance , their receivers to score an extra point by jumping through the uprights after a touchdown reception . Linebackers should not be allowed to trampoline , parachute , or bungee jump into the backfield . Trained monkeys , unicycling go go girls , and Earth , Wind , And Fire have no place on a football field , let alone being a pivotal part of a team ' s game plan . And I know I ' ll get fined for saying this , but if a referee ' s hat is pulled down over his eyes , it should not take him 90 seconds to pull it back up again . "
