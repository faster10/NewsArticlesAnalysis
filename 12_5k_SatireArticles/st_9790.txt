Back on the streets , we caught up with Agnus Flinch , whose been living on the streets of Baltimore for five decades . " I ' ve never felt more stuck in this city , " she told us , who also admitted that duct tape was one very handy product , and had used it to fix almost everything she could think of . The elderly woman planned to save every last bit of the tape they used on her in the coming nights , for ' future projects . ' " Hey , free duct tape ! " was the silver lining in Agnus ' s dark little cloud .
