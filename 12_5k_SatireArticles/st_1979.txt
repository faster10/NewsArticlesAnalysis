" Lately , I ' ve been reading a lot of books about Miami Dolphins cheerleading squad calendars and how they ' re put together how the photos are taken , what ' s going through a particular cheerleader ' s mind as the photos are being taken . It ' s really a fascinating process , " Reinisch said . " So you can imagine how thrilled I was to find out that E ! will soon air a half hour documentary on this very subject . Apparently , when the Dolphins cheerleaders went to Jamaica to shoot their 1999 swimsuit calendar , an E ! reporter and camera crew tagged along to get the inside scoop on the whole thing . It sounds incredible . I ' m masturbating just thinking about it . "
