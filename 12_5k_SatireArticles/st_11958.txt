Now , frosh week has become a yearly tradition for me . Every year I re register for school , book off work for the first week of September , and start counting the days until I can kick some serious frosh party ass ! Then , after the week is over , I log onto ROSI and drop all my classes . It ' s funny , because I always pick weird classes like Parasitic Helminths and Arthropods ' , Evian Biology ' or Wittgenstein ' . Who ' s taking this stuff , really ? Not me . Get a life .
