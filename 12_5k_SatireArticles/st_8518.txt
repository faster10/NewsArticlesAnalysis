Thousands of adoring people lined the streets of Newcastle upon Tyne , as the Christ rode into the city on a donkey , to fulfil the prophecy ' a King shall ride into the Royal city upon an ass ' in Newkiel 3 : 23 : 2 , and ' the King will soon look like one ' in St . James 2 : 32 , and they were crying ' Hosannah , yeah verily , for the King hath returned ! ' , and ' Shearer ! Shearer ! Shearer ! The Messiah is among us for a second time ! '
