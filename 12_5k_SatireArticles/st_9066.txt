As for Lola , she has literally sprung back from her ordeal , having almost taken RSPCA officer , Jack Hoff ' s eye out when he tried to lift her from the wheelie bin . " Christ , the little fecker went ape shite , fair scratched me arm , ear , nose and eyebrows ! " said Mr Hoff . " Mind you , in fairness to Lola after 15 hours stuck in a wheelie bin with only a pair of soiled knickers and tights for company is enough to turn anyone feckin ' crazy innit ? We will of course be conducting our own investigation in this matter and as soon as the DNA report comes back on the knickers and tights we will doubtless be persecuting Ms Bale to the limit , you can count on that !
