Max Clifford was found guilty of several " historical sexual assaults " yesterday , or the day before that or the day before that , it really depends on when your reading this . Appearing outside the courthouse after the verdict had been announced Max looked his normal self , when we say " normal self " we mean like a permatanned Thunderbird puppet villain . He told the assembled press that his lawyers had informed him not to say anything about the case and he immediately walked off to a waiting car . At the time Back and to the Left news were unable to confirm if there were any vulnerable women already in the car when Max got in . We are also unable to confirm if there was anything in the boot or what type of make the car was ( as a Daily Mirror photographer was blocking our view , bastards ) .
