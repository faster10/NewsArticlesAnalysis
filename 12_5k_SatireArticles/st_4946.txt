" This sucks , " Lugar said . " They ' re sending Solana but not me ? I deserve to go so much more than that guy . Powell , okay , he ' s been around forever , but Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov gets to go ? How ' d Lavrov get in line ahead of me for this trip ? I am so briefed on the situation with those state sanctioned killings of Hamas leaders Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Abdel Aziz Rantisi . Colin had better bring me something back some spent shell casings or one of those kitschy religious fanatic posters . "
