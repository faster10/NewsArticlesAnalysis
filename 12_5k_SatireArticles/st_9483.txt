Creel says he gave a free ticket to tonight ' s Deth Knell show to a guy from Chicago he met yesterday at a bar in downtown Toronto who had lost both his legs in Afghanistan . " He took an IED from the Taliban , " said Creel . " How crappy is that ? So I said , " Dude , come to our show tonight . He probably won ' t make it , though . Not that much fun if you ' re in a wheelchair . But it ' s a little thing that I could do to help this guy who has suffered so much .
