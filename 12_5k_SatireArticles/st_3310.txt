" To be honest , I ' ve only been to sanctum maybe three or four times in the last couple years , and only on the most important Self Energy Offering days , " said Walsh , acknowledging that over the past 12 months his only visits to the master compound have come on the Celestial Beckoning and the trillion year anniversary of the Trans Galactic Plague . " I really haven ' t consistently gone to the weekly Thought Purges since I was a teenager . And I can ' t even remember the last time I sat down with a Purity Guide and had my life elementals processed . "
