" There is no such thing as a typical chicken killer , so we have to look at the evidence , " FBI agent James Oberkfell said . " Since the body does not seem to have been sexually abused in any way , we ' re most likely dealing with a someone who lusts only for blood . But whatever the motivation , judging from the efficient , methodical manner in which the body was dismembered , we can assume that our killer is experienced and smart . He ' s done it before . And we believe he ' s working himself up to do it again . "
