In a separate failure , passengers of Flight 209er landing in Chicago were to be met with an empty baggage claim area due to " heightened security concerns . " But due to a mix up , every one of their bags was on the conveyor waiting for the shocked passengers . " We delayed the wrong bags . There were two different flights coming in on a Trans American plane at roughly the same time . Somehow , the baggage of Flight 209 got sent to Baggage Claim 2 on time , " says senior bag boy Boyd Bagg . " By the time we realized our error , there were news reporters swarming the airport asking for comments about the situation . The passengers were all gone . All we could do at that point was blame it on a computer glitch and falsify some records . "
