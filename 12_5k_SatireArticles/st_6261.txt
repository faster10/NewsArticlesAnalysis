Perhaps the most unfulfilling aspect of Tantric sex for the Robertsons is the concept of Kundalini energy , depicted as an inner fire or snake rising from the sexual organs . By failing to awaken this energy and channel it up their spines , unable to transform it as it rises through the body ' s chakras en route to a non explosion in the 32 petaled lotus chakra at the top of the head , the Robertsons achieved a state of ineffable discontentment and complete twoness with the universe .
