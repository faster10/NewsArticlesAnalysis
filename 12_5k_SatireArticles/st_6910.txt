" As much as my country has to offer , our problems must be very apparent to visitors , " Costa said . " A tour through the city reveals some of the worst slums on Earth , with shantytowns , or favelas , stretching as far as the eye can see . A trip to the country shows the shacks of rural laborers in the shadow of the plantation owners ' casa grande , the big house . Everywhere you look in Brazil , there is terrible poverty and suffering . It would take a blind man not to see such pain . "
