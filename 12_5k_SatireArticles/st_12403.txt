If the Boy Scouts have the courage of their Scout Oath and Scout Law and refuse to knuckle under to politial pressure from the left ( a group that doesn ' t particate in the program ) , then I might just become a " Friend of Scouting " ( the name of their annual fundraising drive ) and donate money to the group . If , however , they bow to this pressure and allow gays into the program , then I will do whatever I can to see that my church creates their own program and does not continue with this organization .
