" I have carefully calibrated the settings to 74 degress in the mornings and to 73 in the late afternoon . During the evening , when the temparture outside drops , it then reverts to 78 degrees . Yet every time she goes near the setting button , it ' s the same thing : I come home and find the whole thing completely out of whack and I am either freezing cold or sweating like a hog . "
