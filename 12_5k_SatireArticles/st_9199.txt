" The coup d ' tat , " Krosside said , " was the way the bishops advanced their agenda when they saw the effectiveness of the doublethink offensive .

The same Catholic Church that for decades systematically allowed their priests to sexually abuse children entrusted to their care . Yes , that Catholic Church !
