It is rumored that none of the Dalai Lama ' s characters have made it passed level 1 . Back in August , he created a Dwarven priest class , but he soon dumped it in shame after accidentally punching a rival player . Then in September , he created an Elven warlock class , which he soon realized had the word ' war ' in it so he deleted the character . The paladin is his longest lasting character he created it in early October , but still has not managed to gain any experience points .
