Ms Lance Chaser takes up the story , " These days many people find the idea of going to court rather intimidating and many of these same people revere celebrities like they ' re Gods of some sort who are capable of healing minor injuries with just a brush of their lips . So the idea I had was to provide celebrities to the injured party and they would kiss it better . Of course the cost of hiring celebrities to kiss the great unwashed isn ' t a cheap one . The base price of the policy is five hundred pounds a month . For that you ' ll get someone of off ' Geordie Shore ' to supply the kiss to make it all better . The most expensive policy is fifteen hundred pounds a month . This will give you a host of options , from former ITV newsreader Sir Trevor McDonald to Anne Robinson from the BBC ' s ' Watchdog ' and ' The Weakest Link . ' "
