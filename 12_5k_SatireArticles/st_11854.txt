These tyrants impose crippling taxes , and cackle jovially over our feeble protest . Do you not see that we are fined mercilessly for each ball that is lost to the murky waters that surround holes seven to twelve and are god damned impossible to putt around ? I fear that next they will be taking our first born children into slavery , forcing our sons to scrub the filthy , diseased latrines and our daughters to pleasure the pimpled , high school age gestapo that work in the snack shack .
