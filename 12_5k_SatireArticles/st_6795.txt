" I can ' t wait until you see the card , " Tobler said . " I ordered it online weeks ago . I hardly ever order things online , but it was so perfect , no other card would do . I waited for it for so long , I was about to get another card , but then it finally did end up arriving on Wednesday , April 14 . I remember the day , because I was so relieved I ' d be able to send it out with plenty of time . "
