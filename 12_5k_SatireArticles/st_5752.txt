Before leaving the North , Albright met with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams , who invited her for a pint at a " too cool " little pub in Belfast . According to Albright , the pub was owned and run by a heavy set , chain smoking , 68 year old woman named Molly who " didn ' t take crap from anybody . I loved her to death . The whole time , I was like , ' You go , girl ! ' I won ' t forget her any time soon , that ' s for sure . "
