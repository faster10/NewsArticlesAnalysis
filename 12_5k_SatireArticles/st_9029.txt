" Global warming is the cause of these storms . and the houses of parliament are the cause of global warming . all the politicians have so much hot air in them that when they get to Parliament it is not surprising that they are doing so much damage to the enviroment . in fact they produce so much hot air that i am surprised that the houses of parliament have not floated away like a hot air baloon yet ! ! the amount of hot air being produced by the houses of parliament is having a serious effect on the temperature of our planet . Not only are the houses of parliament causing so much hot air to be produced , they are also producing as much CO2 emissions in a day as the average car does in a year "
