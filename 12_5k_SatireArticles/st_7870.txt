Mr Tukinluk wrapped up the interview by putting on a fedora , wrapping a whip around an overhanging light fixture , pulling it down onto some terrorists while swinging out of a window onto a waiting motorbike which he drove up the side of the Golden Gate Bridge , latching onto a helicopter which he commandeered and flew to the Transamerica Pyramid , whereupon he parachuted out and landed in a convertible which he used to smash through the doors of the building , blew open the floor using some C4 and had a fierce hand to hand battle with Colonel Gaddafi to stop him getting his hands on St . Patrick ' s Staff and rise an army of snakes to destroy San Francisco .
