" Shortly after I arrive home this evening , I will draw a lavender scented bubble bath in my antique , claw foot porcelain tub , " said Barrett , pulling a bobby pin from her hair and releasing a cascade of shimmering auburn hair down the nape of her neck . " Once I have deemed the temperature of the bathwater to be just right , I will allow my terry cloth robe to slip slowly off my shoulders and gather seductively around my feet , leaving my firm , nearly flawless body completely exposed . "
