Irish Social Justice Ambassador and former " rock " musician Bono called a press conference on top of a moving flatbed truck wandering the streets of Geneva , Switzerland to show his support for the snake resettlement . " The Irish have suffered too long without snakes , man , " said Bono . " When I was a boy , growing up on the mean streets of a divided Ireland , I can remember wanting a small scaly friend to comfort me . But back in the bad old days , all we had with scales was fish . The whole of Ireland was surounded by fish . In many ways , it still is . And the Good Book says , when thy son asks for a fish , you can give him a serpent , and it shall be cool , you know ? "
