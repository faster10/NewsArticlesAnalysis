Well , well , my old friend John McCain , the election is only weeks away and I for one can barely stand the suspense ! I am on the edge of my seat not unlike how you used to be when I forced you into that special , narrow bamboo cage for weeks on end . And as the election gets closer , Johnny , I ' m pulling for you pulling like how I did with your hair , your American hands tied behind your back , your face dragging underwater through all those rice paddies !
