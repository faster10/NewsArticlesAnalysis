I guess the man enjoys a good piece of buttered toast ! Strangely , this was the most asked question by Canadians about Mulcair . Canadians queried Google 1 , 483 times in 2015 so far about Mulcair and his smelling like toast . A whopping 642 of those searches were made after the first leaders debate alone . Although Google doesn ' t have many results for this subject , a few posters on Reddit suggested that Mulcair smells like toast because he often has crumbs trapped in his beard . Strange .
