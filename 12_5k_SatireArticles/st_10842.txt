Mr Gobbles was a well known and respected turkey and former resident of Kendall Square ' s in the Cambridge , MA , area . He now lives at a retirement center for turkeys at the Dedham refuge . Since arriving here to live out his life , Mr Gobbles was all too aware of his friends and family who were not granted the residency pass needed to live in this 27 acre refuge . " My sister , Ms Hennypie was supposed to meet up with me in Cambridge in 2004 , but something went terribly wrong and while I waited for her for 5 years at the Volpe Transportation center , she never did arrive . I finally had to accept that she too was among those who had met her fate with the ax . " cried the aging Mr Gobbles .
