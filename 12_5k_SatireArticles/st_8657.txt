" I ' ll tell thee why , " Ken Mither grumbled . " It weren ' t reet . They can use all their bloody fancy KFC logos and all that , but when tha gets reet dahn ter it it ' s chicken and chips . It ' s nowt else ! Nah then tha can ' t have chicken and chips abaht bloody gravy ! If tha ' s ' avin chips tha ' s got to ' ave gravy ! Owt else is just bloody wrong ! It ' s a buggerin ' sin and a shame to ' ave chips baht gravy . I ' ll norrav that bloody McDonald ' s or that Burger King stuff either ! I ' ll norravit ah tell thee ! They all do chips BUT THEY DON ' T DO ' T BLOODY GRAVY WI ' IT ! It ' s got nowt to do wi ' t team I ' ll join in if they ' re goin ' ter ' t chippy , coz they do gravy , an ' mushy peas , and curry sauce , but mainly GRAVY . I ' ll even ' ave a kebab at yon Ali Bullo ' s place coz at least they do chilli sauce , and garlic sauce , and I ' ll ' old me ' ands up kebabs ' d be a bit shite wi ' gravy on ' em . But chicken and chips baht gravy ? That ' s a bloody travesty is that . Oh , and another thing Mickey Chadwick didn ' t get back ' til twenty five past , and we has ter start work again at aff past . Should tell thee summat , that . Fast food my arse ! "
