First stop ? Yesterday , at an independent bookstore in Grand Central Terminal . Commuters and visitors couldn ' t believe their luck , getting to meet the revered author . A Mr Darcy purchased a copy of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies ( by Seth Grahame Smith and Jane Austen ) and asked Ms . Austen if she would autograph it . She refused , shaking her head back and forth in disgust , adding , " Grahame Smith has some nerve . I hope that zombies make a meal of his heart and spleen and then chomp on his brains for dessert . If he has any brains , that is . " Once her tirade was complete , she smiled sweetly at Mr Darcy .
