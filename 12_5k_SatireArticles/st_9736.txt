Roger Ailes , President of Fox News Channel and Chairman of Fox Television Stations Group was asked if he felt the same way . " Absolutely ! " he stated . " A lot of people probably believe that there is some feelings of resentment between Fox News and organizations like MSNBC , but we are all in this together . Sure , we compete on some level for those fringe viewers that pretend to be independent , but overall we all exist to cater to our base demographic . For example , we exist because middle and upper class white people need to get their news somewhere . All those other organizations exist to take care of everyone else . "
