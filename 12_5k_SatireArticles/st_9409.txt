Jay Carney : I want to definitively state the President is in excellent mental condition . His memory may be the best in Washington . He recalls facts about the bin Laden raid easily , and I should add that it was the greatest and most important military operation ever . . . . Since the bin Laden raid , the President has proven his knowledge of SEAL Team 6 again and again . Who they are , where they are stationed , operational limits of their aircraft , Top Secret communication channels , and more . Obama has improved friendships with countries like Russia and Afghanistan with his entertaining stories of what Navy SEALs are doing " right now . "
