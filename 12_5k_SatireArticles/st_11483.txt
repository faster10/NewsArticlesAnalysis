The Italian sausage has long been a popular food around the world , but the explosive kind is only recently becoming a weapon for crazed outlaws . Credit for its invention goes to Bartoni Mastrollini , a man who spent the better part of his life attempting to create a means of suicide that would not cause death . Mastrollini discovered that using a makeshift dynamite stick out of Italian sausage might work . The exploding sausage worked , except it killed the victim . Frustrated and defeated , Mastrollini sold the idea to a local criminal family who began to manufacture the exploding sausage on the Black Market .
