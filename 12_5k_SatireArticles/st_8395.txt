" When a customer sitting on a chair in one of the game pits asked him to stop yelling and swearing , Boynton went over to the customer and shoved him off the chair onto the floor , " one of the police sources told The Buffalo News . " I didn ' t think someone could get so crazy on alcohol . He was cursing and shouting that he knew how to make money and the casino didn ' t . " Yes , this Nick Boynton asshole is a really nice guy . A class act . A prince . A real charmer !
