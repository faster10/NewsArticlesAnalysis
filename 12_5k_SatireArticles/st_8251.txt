But in all seriousness , every time I see an opposing team player come near me , I get scared and I feel that the bullying is inevitably going to follow . THAT is why I throw myself on to the ground and pretend to be in so much pain . And if , as a consequence , it means that my team Barcelona get an advantage , so be it . I mean did you see what happened today ? The ball wasn ' t even in play when I went to the ground . Puyol simply shouted that someone was behind me and I was so scared , that I automatically fell over ! The rest , they say , is history ! "
