" Californians have stated that they do not want people of the same sex marrying " , stated California Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald George . " To stay in compliance with the wishes of the people of California , and the Mormon Church , we insist that at the time of nuptials one party be male and the other female . However , once married for six months or longer , the party who has changed genders may switch back to his or her original gender without a change in marital status " .
