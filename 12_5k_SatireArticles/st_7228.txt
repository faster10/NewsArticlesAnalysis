Spooky the Square Pumpkin is made fun of and left out of the crowds . One day he gets so angry that he purchases dozens of watermelons , carries them over to the farm , and freezes them . The next morning he takes them out and puts them into a canon one by one and one by one he disembodied each circle pumpkin .
