Horace Fraggleton , another Christian man , caught his wife cheating on him . He thought that Jesus would likely have forgiven her , but although he owned a WWJD bracelet , he happened to be wearing the one about the Iron Age yokel instead and so he threw stones at her head . Sitting in jail , Horace beamed with pride and said , " The authorities don ' t understand , just like the Roman soldiers of Jesus ' s day . So now I ' m more Christ like than ever before , thanks to the bracelet . "
