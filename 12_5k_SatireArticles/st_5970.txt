If you haven ' t yet bought yourself a present in honor of Frank Sinatra ' s 78th birthday , consider this compilation , a backhanded compliment from 41 different bands . Ranging from eclectic ( Kramer , Girls Against Boys ) to obscure ( Pool , Nod ) to cult ( Flaming Lips , Ed Hall ) , all the artists combine respect for Sinatra ' s showmanship with contempt for the man himself . The results are great fun , especially Screeching Weasel ' s blast through " Chicago " and Lotion ' s surprisingly faithful take on " Fly Me To the Moon . " Important ironic trivia fact : Not even one of the songs on this two disc , two hour set was written by Ol ' Blue Eyes himself . JK
