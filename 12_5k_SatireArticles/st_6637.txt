" If President Reagan hid the money there , it was for a good reason , " Sen . Lamar Alexander ( R TN ) said . " Perhaps he was creating an anticommunist slush fund . Or perhaps , as one of his notebooks stated , he was hiding it from invisble pirates . Either way , we must not taint this great man ' s legacy by spending these precious funds on trifling social programs . If anything , we need to preserve Reagan ' s memory by sinking the entire payload into an unviable space based antimissile system . "
