I tire very easily so I will make it simple . Even a Ghost can understand . Ha Ha Oh , I sometimes crack myself up . The ghosts are simply in a different time frame . Something causes a wave or warp in time and you see people who once lived in the same house , at a previous time . That ' s why many times they merely walk through walls , dress in old fashioned clothes . They are in their normal times dressed as they did say 200 years ago and during that time , the wall they walked through simply did not exist .
