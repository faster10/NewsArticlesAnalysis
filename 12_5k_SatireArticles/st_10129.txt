Finally , and the most bizarre of all , was the body of Srahim Laceon . He had made it home when the assailant caught up to him . There are no signs of forced entry and the cameras that were recently mounted in the Laceon home did not catch anyone entering . It is not certain how or when it happened , but , a grenade exploded in very close proximity to Mr Laceon . Forensics professionals say that it is not conclusive , but , it appears that it may have been modified with an adhesive of some sort and " stuck " to him prior to the explosion .
