" The course of my life changed last week when a waitress dropped a tray and I was struck with hot coffee , " Lyman said . " As I wiped my eyes and opened them , suddenly I became aware of the full extent of the corruption . Sweet crepes mingling with egg runoff . The sickening decadence of Belgian waffles . A waitstaff more concerned with lining their pockets with tips than with dedicating their lives to service . I stormed from the wicked place without settling my bill , finally realizing what I must do : devote my life to bringing down the House of Pancakes . To bring it down , then build it anew in righteousness and customer satisfaction . "
