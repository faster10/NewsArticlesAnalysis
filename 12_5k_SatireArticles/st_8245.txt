International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said that he was sick and tired of perfectly good athletes being ousted from the Games for taking cold medications or attempting to better themselves in any way possible . " We now encourage athletes to do whatever it takes to be the best they can be " , he said . " With this long overdue decision form the Committee we will now see records broken like never before . Runners will run faster . Weightlifters will be lifting twice what they could before . Gymnasts will be able to perform acrobatics that the world has never seen ! I anticipate the entire world will be watching the Games this year without exception . Advertising revenues will go through the roof ! "
