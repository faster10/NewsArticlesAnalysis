George Wigham strongly denies the accusation and says the collision was entirely Matt ' s fault . Claims George , ' In actual fact I did see Matt ' s conga approaching as I went to turn the corner and so I tried to take evasive action so as to pass Matt ' s conga safely , but Matt veered out into my path . ' George adds , ' Matt wasn ' t looking where he was going , he had his eyes looking down at a mobile phone he was holding in his hands . '
