The Monty Python Flying Circus have entered as outside candidates and it wouldn ' t be a surprise to see some sort of sketch based consortium taking up office come next week . It had been rumoured earlier this week that the devil had been offered some form of temporary role as he does have previous experience but those claims were quashed almost as fast as they ' d been circulated . Of course it can only be a man and if no suitable successor is found the decision will be put before God ' s boss , The Gods , on Monday morning .
