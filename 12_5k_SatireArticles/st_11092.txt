Or how ' s about this weirded out scenario : Having a Big Oil company totally pollute a large body of water say like one of the Great lakes to prove that oil contamination kills wildlife . And while all the birds , mammals , fish , even insects , get sick and die , there would be a big promotional campaign spearheaded to bolster the fact that oil spills are just no good and they kill wild animals . If a few human beings end up as casualties to this mess , it ' s all well and good for the overall cause , now isn ' t it ? It ' d be like adding a fuel booster shot to a full tank of cheap gas . Hip , hip , hurray ! Money could be made by hiking up the price of gasoline from 2 . 65 a gallon to 29 . 55 a gallon until the total cleanup of the effected body of water was complete . Who ' s even counting anymore ?
