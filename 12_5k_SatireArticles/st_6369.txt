2012 was a landmark year for the minority or whatever , who made their voices heard like never before and blah , blah , blah . Many minority groups , including African Americans , Hispanics , women , same sex couples , and whoever else took on a more prominent role in the nation ' s political discourse , or something along those lines . They also made great strides for better pay and equal employment opportunities , making the case that they deserve to be treated as valuable members of society and whatever other bullshit they were whining about all year .
