Many critics have slated the Wachowski Bros . for their incessant milking of the matrix idea . One critic gave us this opinion , " The first film was great , with never before seen special effects . The story was a bit pants , just some of the best bits from many science fiction comics all intertwined , with Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburn thrown in for good measure . All in all though a good film . The second film was really crap . It seemed like the story had been dreamt up in some corner of a pub on a Saturday night . The action in the third film perked it up a bit , but overall the two sequels were very , very poor .
