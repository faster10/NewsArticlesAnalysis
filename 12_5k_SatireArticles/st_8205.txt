At the core of the tracking and interpretation software behind A3 , is the Master Oversight Monitor or " MOM " . It reportedly does so well at interpreting geo positioning and ambient sounds , developers say the MOM software knows where you are and what you are doing , 24 hours a day . " It ' s pretty great to get a phone call from MOM , warning me to avoid a particular Sushi restaurant with a bad inspection record , or with an immediate background check on a guy I ' m meeting for the first time " , says Dr Bichalott . " It ' s not so great when MOM tells me I can ' t order the cheesecake because I already have too much junk in my trunk " .
