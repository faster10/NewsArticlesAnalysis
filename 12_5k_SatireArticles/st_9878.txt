Spokesperson Vin Reaper of Death Advil the leading painkiller for the dead is spearheading the effort to stop what he calls " a deadly rule " from moving forward . " Look , regulation is likely to kill the industry , as most of the players in the market are small entities and have tiny profit margins . Mandating a quality of death care equal to the high health care quality standards set in this nation will make death care a prohibitively expensive service to offer to those buried in coffins . One provision of the proposed rule , for example , would require that death care companies exhume corpses on a daily basis in order to slow the natural rate of decomposition , as this is thought to be too painful for the dead to bear . The compliance costs associated with this requirement are high enough to almost surely cause death care companies to exit the industry for good . " And spokesperson Salvatore Di Morto from Club Dead , the only all inclusive resort for the dead , said that " the small village in which the resort is located will be a ghost town if the regulation is finalized .
