" Unless they can put the piece of litter in somebody ' s hand immediately prior to being chucked on the floor , they can ' t prosecute , even under the environment act of 2005 or the littering act of 1996 . Completely irrelevant , a waste of a stamp sending it out , and if they ever did try and prosecute , the Crown Prosecution Service would laugh in their face . They ' ve not got the litter , any evidence at all and I say to him , bring it on . "
