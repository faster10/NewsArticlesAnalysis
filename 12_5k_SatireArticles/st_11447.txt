The closing statements made in the memo highlighted the need for clergy to deny any link between God and the accident and to take steps to silence the voicing of any opinions supporting this view . " It is important that we distance God from any responsibility in the events which led up to the accident . Any doubt as to God ' s all loving nature reflects badly on him and , by association , on the church itself potentially leading to a drop in revenue . Any such doubts raised by members of the congregation should be immediately addressed and steps should be taken to silence the guilty party using the standard ' bad things happen because people have free will ' argument . "
