Smith ' s plans for this November include clever vote tallying , voter restriction lists , mis cast votes , and cleverly wired adding machines to assure the outcomes of key elections . " And since September 11th , " Smith said , " we ' ve got this thing called ' Suspected Terrorist Voter Limitation Inititiative ' from the boys over at Homeland Security . All we have to do is suspect someone , say 100 people here and there , of being even remotely tied to terrorists , and we yank their vote . "
