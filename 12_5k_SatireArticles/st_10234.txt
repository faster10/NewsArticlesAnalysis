Although the recent tasing of Lew Rockwell only made the local news , the event itself was spectacular by any standard . According to Rockwell , he was merely distressed over the fact that a black couple moved in some distance from his home , a neighborhood that is otherwise inhabited only by Caucasians . " The only thing I ' ve done is complain to a neighbor about the situation , " Rockwell explained in his hospital bed . " Next thing I know , fire trucks , police cars , SWAT vans , black helicopters , and the National Guard are screeching to a halt in front of my home " !
