Well grandma , it ' s not going to take Lt . Joe Kenda the homicide hunter to crack this nut . A security guard who ' s been smoking crack could place all the pieces of this whacko murder for hire scenario together like a kid ' s five piece jigsaw puzzle . And don ' t be looking for James Patterson to write a true crime article on this , either . Your little fiasco is even too strange and diabolical for even him . But out of fairness , I will say that Dylan Loveless is such an unsavory character , using an antagonist like him in any story would cause most readers to throw that copy of Nut Case Grandmothers Their So Called Hit Men across the room and into the fireplace , where it will burst into flames .
