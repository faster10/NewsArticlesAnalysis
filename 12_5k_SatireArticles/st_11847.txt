Maybe they saw him in a blue Dodge B100 parked outside of Rhonda ' s Bakery in Wurstburg Michigan on September 4th , 1983 . Or else maybe they saw him check into a doctor ' s office for a routine angioplasty in Wichita Kansas on April 16th of 2002 . Or else maybe they saw him take part in a top secret supersoldier experiment under Cheyenne mountain on January 29th of 2013 at 5 : 15 in the morning . Who knows ? People come up with some crazy crazy things .
