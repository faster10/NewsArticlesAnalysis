" TV news reporting has always been about breaking the story down into only the barest , most salient facts , but the breakneck pace of contemporary reportage doesn ' t allow for that anymore , " said Professor Robert Kubey , director of the Center for Media Studies at Rutgers University . " Today ' s ace reporter isn ' t the one with the best command of the language , but the one who can say ' Congress ! ' or ' Health care ? ' or ' Slam dunk ! ' with the most appropriate expression on his or her face . "
