" After Mr Close sent me this portrait , " said Pachauri , " I had a Hinduesque brainstorm . I shall return to my palatial home in Golf Links , New Delhi , for much needed rest and contemplation of my future , and then open an office in Mumble Town otherwise known as Mumbai , formerly Bombay and go into the horror film business . I shall cast myself in the leads of remakes of many Western classics that starred Lon Chaney , Boris Karloff , and Chucky the Doll . I shall employ such cinematic techniques made famous by Sergio Leone in his spaghetti Westerns . I believe that is what inspired Mr Close to embark on his unique career . I shall remake the George Romero " Living Dead " movies from Indian and environmental perspectives . "
