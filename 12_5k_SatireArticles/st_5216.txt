When informed of his rival ' s clay based philosophies , top ranked men ' s player Roger Federer was nonplussed . " I do not dispute that Rafael is extremely difficult to beat on his favored surface , " Federer said in a telephone interview Wednesday , " but I believe it is purely because it suits his personal style of play , not because his attendants encase him in a clay sarcophagus every night . We may be rivals , but I worry about him , especially since he was treated twice last winter in Barcelona for clay inhalation . "
