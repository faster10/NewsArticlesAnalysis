A tent shantytown has sprung up about Nativity scene . Those who stand on the exact spot where Herb discovered the mysterious image again , only when the street light is on also claim to see the slice of toast . However , disagreement abounds over what the slice signifies . Some think it spells doom , exemplified by makeshift signs one reads " The Yeast Shall Rise Again " while another proclaims " Repent . The Second Crumbing Is Nigh . " Oh , and " Schwebel 3 : 16 . " Others who have traveled are stricken with gluten allergies and believe that touching the blow mold on Virgin Mary ' s plastic bosom where the image appears will help their bowels simmer down . Still , other visitors just plain old love toast . " I love toast , " says Tabitha Whitman , a claims adjuster from Paducah , TN , who loves toast .
