" This fun , interactive , pre processed food item represents a whole new way of snacking , " said Minneapolis resident Sandra Hirsch . " If the sprinkles came already mixed in , that ' d be boring . But by enclosing the " Magic " Color Changing Sprinkles in a separate , sealed plastic packet , Smucker ' s has given me the opportunity to actively participate in the snacktime process tearing open the sprinkles envelope , peeling back the jelly packet ' s cover seal , mixing in the sprinkles , and watching the two snack components fuse in a snacktacular explosion of color , a snack experience greater than the sum of its parts .
