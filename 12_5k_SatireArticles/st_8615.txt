Professor Tim Noakes , a leading sports scientist with unsupported evidence to back up his claim said , " I can see a time when normal people start faking behaviour patterns to resemble muscular dystrophy or spina bifida just for the chance to take part in an Olympic event . Anyone looks convincing just screwing up their face and adding a bit of an arm tremble . I ' m telling you now , the world of disablity athletics is already rife with cheats how do we really know blind runners are blind . . . . . . . perhaps we need more stringent tests like we do on able bodied athletes who are always being drug tested . Perhaps we need random eyesight tests out of season perhaps the IOC should get into partnership with Specsavers and start taking this seriously . "
