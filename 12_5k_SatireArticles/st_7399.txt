" I know I said I had stopped at Book Seven and would never write another . . . and I am sooooo embarrassed , believe me . But my controllers , . . . er . . . backers , " she explained , " simply want more money . Isn ' t it ridiculous after all the millions I made for them ? Sadly , I have to comply or the media might start saying bad things about me like they did with Prince Charles ( laughing ) . . . and we have the franchises to protect and future film deals , and the magical royalties , of course , stretching far into the future which are sooooooo lucrative . I don ' t know the exact figure . . . but it is huge . Harry will go on forever like James Bond . By the time I am finished I will have written more words than Leo Tolstoy in a quarter of the time . Isn ' t that soooo amazing ? "
