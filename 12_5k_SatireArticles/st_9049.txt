" I was downstairs watching Big Brother when I heard a strange noise from upstairs , like a scream and " help , get it off me ! " . After waiting half an hour to see who was going to be evicted I rushed straight up to my daughters room and found her lying on her bed alongside a large Fox which had a lighted roll up in it ' s mouth . I rushed straight out of the room and updated my Facebook status to tell everyone , then after accepting a few Farmville gifts I rushed back into the room with a broom to chase the Fox away . It just looked at me like it owned the place before casually trotting out of the room . I was terrified ! "
