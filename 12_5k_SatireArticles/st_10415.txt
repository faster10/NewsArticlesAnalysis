Reporter B . Crocker from the Ladies Home Journal asked Vice Assistant Director Counter if he could indicate what interdiction inroads have been made . Counter countered , " Just yesterday we took 12 year old Janie Gertrude Hobson into custody , after observing her exchanging coins for cookie dough with other Girl Scouts while suspiciously walking up Maple Way . Ms . Hobson has been detained in an undisclosed location , pending further interrogation and investigation . We have reliable intelligence that Ms . Hobson is just one member of a very large cell of contraband dealers centered around John Brown Elementary School . "
