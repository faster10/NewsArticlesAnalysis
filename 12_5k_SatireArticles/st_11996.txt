" Our goal is to make flames shoot out your behind , boiling the water in your toilet and making you want to sit on a bag of ice . We want you to have scorch marks , not skid marks , in your shorts . The goal of this product is to actually put off enough explosive pressure to literally send Alice to the moon ! . We intend to give new meaning to the expression scorched Earth . Twelve hours after one helping of our salsa , we think that Elton John really could sing a song about being the Rocket Man . "
