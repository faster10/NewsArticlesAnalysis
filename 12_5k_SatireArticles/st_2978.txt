" I said to her , ' Mom , don ' t pull those weeds in your tomato garden out by hand . Get a soil aerator , so you don ' t have to bend down , ' " said Seely , 46 . " She told me , ' Oh , honey , I ' m used to doing it this way . Besides , you and Hoagland ' s other daughter Peggy don ' t like gardening , so it wouldn ' t be of any use to you once I pass on . ' Good Lord . "
