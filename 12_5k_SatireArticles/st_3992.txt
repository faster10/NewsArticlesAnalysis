Far more ambitious in scope than the previous missions of 88 million , 110 million , and 375 million , Denarius IV is a two stage spacecraft . Its solar probe , Croesus , will disengage from the main craft in October and release 12 million into the sun . The craft , with its remaining payload of 688 million , will travel across the solar system , reaching Jupiter by June 2007 . Once there , it will eject the money from the cargo bay in what will be the largest single financial deployment in NASA history .
