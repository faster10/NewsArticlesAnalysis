Concluding her address Ms . Palin said : " Recently when I was in New York City a Korean grocer told me that the WORLD needs leaders like me . Thinking about this expression of confidence I realised that America , with the G . O . P . , has the strength to deal with the radical pinko leftists in the White House . My talents would be wasted here , but as President of our dear ally I could help them in their unceasable battle with those commie red Chinese people . This , it has been revealed to me , is the reason I am not on this planet . Thank you all and goodnight . "
