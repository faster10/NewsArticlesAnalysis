" It usually brings me great joy to share my love and forgiveness with all God ' s children , but when Derek sought the holy power of my redemption , I have to admit that I really wanted no part of it , " said Christ , explaining His unease over building a spiritual communion with a man He described as " all in all , pretty annoying . " " I would have been perfectly happy with never cleansing Derek of his sins and transgressions , but , unfortunately , when a believer reaches out to me with faith in their hearts , I kind of have to reach back , even if it ' s Derek . "
