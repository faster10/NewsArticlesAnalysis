According to Florin Buttercup , spokeswoman for Congressman Guilder , " One of the best features of the proposed law is to create a permit that frequent fliers can apply for . Once a person obtains the permit ( which costs a nominal 75 ) , no special screening is needed for up to 5 years . Obtaining the permit is practically the same as obtaining a secret clearance . The person ' s background will be checked thoroughly as we do for members of the military who need to handle classified information . "
