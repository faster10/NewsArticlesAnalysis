" We ' ve cured lotsa diseases and invented a bunch of vital technologies , " said Eric Pucci of Gruene , TX . " And I hate to bring this up , because they ' ll just call me a warmongering meathead or something , but we ' re breaking our backs to bring democracy to the whole damn world . England fights side by side with us , and yet they still treat us like they ' re deigning to form an alliance with us . Ask the rest of the world you ' ll find a whole lot of nations who would want to be our friends . No , not everyone . But a lot of countries . "
