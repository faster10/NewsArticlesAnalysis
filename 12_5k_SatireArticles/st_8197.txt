It is believed that around 1930 , some not so bright spark ( presumably having read a back issue of PW ) hit upon the idea that he could perhaps get away with a ' low ' power version of Mr de Corset ' s unit to have music ' throughout his home ' . Could this have been a forerunner of what is called a homeplug or powerline adapter . This chap apparently put together a basic unit with a primitive valve amplifier , either the output or the input would be plugged into a mains socket ( please do not try this at home ! ) after ' isolating ' it using a valve heater filament or speaker transformer ( it is not clear from what remains of the sketchy ' circuit diagram ' ) depending on whether he was ' sending ' or ' receiving ' his ' data ' which would generally be in the form of audio from a wireless or a record player . He used a number of these devices around his house and in his shed workshop .
