I did reach out to both the Southern and National Baptist Convention with regards of using lethal force under a circumstance such as this . They all vehemently denied any endorsement of violence but were strong supporters of the 2nd amendment . I then called 37 different Baptist churches at random , all but four confirmed that their deacons and most congregants are armed and 16 of the churches admitted to a " shoot on site policy " regarding anyone who interferes with the Lord ' s message getting to their God fearing congregants .
