To improve the general feel of the games , the tedious and repetitive sport curling is to be modified significantly . An Olympic Committee spokesperson said that : " We ' ve realised if people wanted to see a lot of women brushing floors , they could just no go home from the office and watch the cleaners . So we ' re changing the sport a bit . " In fact , the brushes remain but this time as weapons . They will be used like swords to attack the opponent , and the first to go out of the circular targets used for the curling stones in the older style of curling . For added bonus , a team will be allowed one " ACME Attack " , where a huge curling stone will be dropped on an opponent ' s head , in typical cartoon style .
