" You have to give the ball away after you score by kicking it off , and no one likes that , but that ' s different from punting , " Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin said . " For one thing , you ' re in a good mood because you just scored . And you can ' t score more than one touchdown each time you have the ball that ' s the rule . So you have to kick the ball away , but it ' s sort of okay , since you can ' t really do anything else . "
