Plus I didn ' t even think my performance was that good . I was going for a kind of Vin Diesel ' thing , and I ' m not sure I pulled it off . Hell , the movie would have been so good if Vin was in it . He could have walked around saying things like " I am the President , cloaked in immense power . " and people would have really believed him because he looks so strong . Especially if he did that scene shirtless . Its lucky for me he passed on the part .
