Grade 1Students will learn to identify all body parts excluding genitalia . Students will have a firm understanding of non sexual body parts ( e . g . ears , forearms , nose , chins ) , but will not be provided correct terminology of sexual body parts until grade 12 ( e . g . penis , vagina , breasts , buttox , anus , hips , thighs , mouth , tongue , throat , and hands ) . Instead , students will be provided with numerous idiomatic means to allude to these bodily features ( e . g . wee wee , tinkler , bum , girl parts , boy parts ) .
