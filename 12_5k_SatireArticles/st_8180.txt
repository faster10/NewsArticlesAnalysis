" I was sitting there on the beach last summer while my big brother and his girlfriend were swimming . She had on this white bikini , see , and when she came out of the water it was like she had nothing on . Nothing ! Then they disappeared behind this dune for awhile , and then that ' s where I came up with the idea , why should he have all the fun ? So I thought if water makes white cloth nearly invisible , then what if I wrote an app that that rendered all clothing white when viewed through a camera lens , while at the same time skewing the properties of light to make the material appear wet ? So , like , that ' s what I did . Pretty cool , huh ? "
