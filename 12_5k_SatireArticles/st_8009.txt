The first of the recorded text messages according to Dr McCorkle , came to a couple in Cleveland Heights , Ohio when they received a text message in the middle of the night . According to the couple , their I pad pinged at 3 AM and was after they had spent an amorous hour together . Startled , Mrs " M " who prefers to remain anonymous , picked up her I pad and the message read : " OMG ! LOL ! That was a hoot ! Talk about riding the Wild Monkey ! Let ' s do it again ! " After that Mrs " M " stated the texts have been unending .
