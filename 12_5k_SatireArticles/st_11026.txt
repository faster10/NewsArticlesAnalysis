It ' ll all be sorted , don ' t you be worrying now Ye know , this was quite exciting there ' s not much crime around our parts , I believe this was something even bigger than when there were two whole cows trapped in a cattle grid aye , now I thought I ' d seen it all don ' t worry Don ' t worry now , everyone ' s calm , and we ' ll all be fine , now .
