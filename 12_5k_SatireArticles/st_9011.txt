Sightings of Grifiniks have increased recently , this probably attributable to the fact that , stupid as it is , the creature can sense when people aren ' t looking it is unlikely it understands why this happens , so the Grifinik is nothing more than a lurking opportunist a little like a hyena albeit considerably less cuddly and infinitely more smelly . One is believed to have surfaced in Yorkshire one day , Manchester the next , then London a few days later where it was pelted with eggs . This , itself , is a curious affair ancient Pictish and Saxon legends both have tales of villagers throwing rotten farm produce at unnamed bogeymen to drive them away and the spontaneous and admirable response of Londoners to the unbidden appearance of a Grifinik suggests some ancient folk memory laying dormant in the British psyche .
