But just this last week I ' ve had something like 60 people walk up to congratulate me on Star Wars : The Force Awakens , or demand I tell them insider information about Game of Thrones . Even for an experienced actor with as thick a skin as I , this is getting to be a bit much . Being repeatedly reminded of missing out on these roles does hurt a little . I could have really used that cheque . Because let ' s be real , no matter how far you go as a Canadian actor you still worry about bankin ' the Bordens .
