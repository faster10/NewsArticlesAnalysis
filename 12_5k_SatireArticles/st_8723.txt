" I ' d like to point out that although Hull isn ' t a " Urban paradise " it isn ' t as bad as " UK ' s Shittest City Guide " has made out . For a start were not Leeds which has got to give us at least twenty " were not shit points " . Hull has many great things to be proud of we have the worlds largest submarium which has a fantastic fish restaurant in it . Two top flight rugby teams reside in our great city and the football team once had Ray Parlour playing for them . Please let us not forget the man who abolished slavery , William Wilberforce , came from Hull . Not London , Birmingham , Edinburgh or New York but Hull . It was here in this fair city that the first slabs of racial equality were laid over the garden of bigotry . "
