SFA Chief Executive Stewart Regan attempted to explain the thinking behind the potential move . " We live in ever increasingly sensitive times and we don ' t wish to offend others . After the decision by the GFRS we feel it ' s only right and proper to review our use of the Saltire . Removing it isn ' t the only option . Another proposal is to have it embroidered inside the shirt . That way the players and fans would still know it was there but the opposition wouldn ' t be offended because they wouldn ' t be able to see it . That ' s my preference . We all know you can ' t be offended by something you can ' t see . Not unless your some sort of modern day Mary Whitehouse . "
