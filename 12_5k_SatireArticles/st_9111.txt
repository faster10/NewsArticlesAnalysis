" There ' s too many people tweeting about absolute bollocks , " an angry commuter at London ' s Waterloo station told Skoob News . " I don ' t usually mind other people tweeting absolute shite , but when I want to tweet that I ' ve been stood in the queue at the chemist ' s , waiting for my prescription for more than three minutes , and can ' t tell the worldabout it , there ' s something seriously wrong . Somebody needs to get their priorities in order . This whole episode is just shameful . "
