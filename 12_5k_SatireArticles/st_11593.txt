In a special piece published in newspapers across Canada , Garneau has set out the reasoning behind the challenge : " For as long as man has gazed at the heavens , he has dreamed of conquering them . Both myself and Commander Hadfield have touched the very fabric of the space , soaring higher than mortal man has dreamed . However , neither of us have ever set foot upon the cursed satellite , The Moon , which few have visited but none have seized . And it is for this reason I hereby issue forth a wager to Mr Hadfield ! A Race . "
