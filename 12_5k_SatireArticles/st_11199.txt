" It ' s tough having that conversation with your own son , " God admitted in his characteristically booming voice . " But we had to move forward with this decision . I mean , we had a good run for what , a thousand years or so ? We were both loved and feared by all of Europe , the churches were magnificent , everyone was willing to kill or die for us , but now we look more like a fast food chain with these cookie cutter churches . It ' s a real bummer . Some of it was our own fault . The Inquisition was a public relations nightmare and the Crusades well they never really worked out , did they ? Then that little bastard Martin Luther came along and ruined it all . And I don ' t have much to say about the guy who made that printing press , Gutenberg , yeah , the guy who got everyone into books . That whole education thing didn ' t help at all once people started thinking for themselves . Anyway , we parted ways for the greater good . We simply have to re brand before all these Muslims , Hindus and Jews make a comeback . Jesus wasn ' t on board with the change . I mean he fought us tooth and nail on that Christian Rock thing in the ' 80 ' s , and those t shirts from a few years ago that said Jesus is My Homeboy , the kid hated them . I actually thought they were pretty cool . "
