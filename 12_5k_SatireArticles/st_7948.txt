As mentioned before , all the voltages can be changed as well as the current limit . In fact , the current limiting function can be disabled entirely . Of course , the power supply can ' t safely deliver an unlimited amount of current , so disabling the current limit is highly inadvisable . The current limit protects against connecting too many components or a component failing shorted . If there is no current limit , and a component fails shorted , the power supply could literally start on fire .
