There was almost a sensation in the qualifying round of the 2002 Genghis Khan Ulan Bator Challenge , in a match between Britain ' s Tim Henman and a Numbat , or Banded Ant Eater from Western Australia . Henman was leading by two sets to one , and the numbat seemed more interested in probing for termites beyond the doubles lines . An upset seemed very much on the cards , until the numbat realised that there were no termites to be found up the skirt of the line judge , and rallied , to win the next 14 games and take the tie .
