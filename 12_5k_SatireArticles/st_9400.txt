" Well first the banker comes in and pays you no interest on your savings account while charging you fees to store your money , spend your money and find out how much money you have . Then a loan officer gets on stage and writes you a 500 page mortgage that will put you into forclosure 90 days after closing , while a derivatives expert bundles that mortgage into a security that they sell to thier clients while taking out a credit default swap so they profit when the instrument fails . Then a credit card company offers you a 0 APR card that charges 30 interest on all purchases and destroys your credit score because your 72 month car loan , your 30 APR credit card and your mortgage company all expect to be paid first after the hospital puts a lien on your liver because yor insurance compoany lists alive as a preexisting condition . Then the big commercial brokerages destroy the stock market so your retirement ends up being worthless , and all those bundled bad mortgages end up in forclosure destroying the value of your home . So the banker f s the consumer , the insurance company f s the consumer , the loan officer f s the consumer , the derivates market f s the consumer , the repo man f s the consumer , the credit card company f s the consumer , and Wall street f s the consumer ! Then they all get off the poor battered and bloodied consumer who ' s paying more taxes than any of these guys , stand up and take a bailout from the Fed ! "
