" The most exciting things in this line of work are the small victories . To give an example , last year me and my assistant Lorna Kelby had to get our hands on the Spear of Destiny before Osama Bin Laden did , or he ' d be able to raise an army of undead super soldiers to take over the world . I only got into one truck motorcycle race along twisty Pakistani mountainside highways . The amount of terrorists I killed was much less than 5 , and the most exciting of them was when I inserted my tiny toothbrush into a terrorist ' s mouth , causing him to reflexively start brushing , making him fall under the slats of the collapsing wooden bridge we were on into the path of an oncoming steam train . I don ' t see how anyone could think the life of an archaeologist is one of exciting adventure . "
