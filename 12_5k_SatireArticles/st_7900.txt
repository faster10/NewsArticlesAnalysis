Unlock to unlock uses a separate device called a ' key ' which , when held over an icon on the screen known as the ' keyhole ' and twisted , unlocks the device . Each ' key ' could be unique , and should you own more than one device you could link all your ' keys ' together on a ' key ring ' . So that you know that these are your ' keys ' a range of amusing ' key fobs ' will be available , with legends such as ' My other phone is an iPhone5 ! ' .
