Also , in the story , Samsa the cockroach is chased by his father , who pelts him with apples . One of the apples becomes embedded in his back , causing a wound that eventually kills him . There is no evidence of which we are aware to suggest that Miley Cyrus has ever been chased by an apple throwing father , or that she has an apple embedded in her back , though that would explain some of the moves she pulls in that green leotard . But soft will Miley turn into a giant cockroach before Isis and Osiris can offer salvation ?
