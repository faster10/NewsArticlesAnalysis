" I do not wish to discuss that at this time , " Duncan said . " I ' m just glad no one was hurt while I was experimenting with Coke , or Pepsi , or root beer , or whatever it was . I just remember going into my apartment , turning on the television , unblocking Showtime , and calling up a few girls from church to say ' hello ' and ' how are you doing . ' Frankly I ' m mortified , and in light of my actions , I wouldn ' t blame them for being cross with me in return . I was brought up to respect women , not to place telephone calls to them at what might possibly be well past their bedtimes . "
