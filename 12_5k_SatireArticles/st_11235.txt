The Parking Czar who has a permanent penthouse office , free luxury car and free parking spot at the expense of the taxpayers , is unconcerned about public complaints as he said they are all a pack of whingers and i can park OK and this role is really great for my career , so i can ' t see any problem . Further he " warned disabled drivers they were a target given they thought they could park anywhere just because the had a bit of a limp " , he said with a scoff while sucking on a beer at lunch time .
