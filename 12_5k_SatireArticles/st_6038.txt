" The Stanley Cup deserves a lot of credit , because , I ' ll be honest with you , I wouldn ' t have had the patience to continuously work with an honor as limited in its mental faculties as Rickey Henderson ' s Hall of Fame plaque , " said Janet Kempley , co chair of the Norquist Prize selection committee . " But that ' s what the Stanley Cup does . It single handedly boosted the self esteem of the Wimbledon plate and made it feel like an important accomplishment even when a lot of people were making fun of it with derogatory comments . And look at it now . It ' s very prestigious for tennis . "
