Burlison recalls , " I was strangely mesmerized by the sight of the craft and just about ran my truck off the road . The craft looked like it was about 200 feet off the ground when the objects starting falling from the bottom . The craft itself looked to be about 100 feet in diameter and about 50 feet tall at the highest point . It was catching the light from the sun and just about blinded me at times . Since I always carry my camera with me to take photographs of wildlife , I pulled over and snapped a photo . I was shaking so badly it is a bit fuzzy . "
