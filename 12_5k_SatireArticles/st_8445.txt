Maybe it ' s because most people played the game at some point or another in their life , and it takes them back to their glory days . Well those days are not so glorified when you were a hell of a young ball player and the leagues President has a son who ALSO played 3rd base who was picked to be in All Stars over you . Okay so he had two more homeruns that year than I did , but I know I beat him in every other category , except strikeouts , and errors . That All Star team didn ' t advance to the LLWS anyway , but I always think could I have made the difference ? Maybe we could have been able to make that trip just over the mountain to get the national attention we deserved ? ? We will never know .
