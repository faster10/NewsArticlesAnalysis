Among the show ' s objectionable segments : videotaped footage of a sudden , brutal attack by New Rochelle , NY , dentist Richard Rosenblatt on an unsuspecting dry cleaner . As the tape shows , tension mounted as Rosenblatt , after waiting in line more than 25 minutes to pick up his clothes at Sunrise Cleaners , became involved in a prolonged argument with dry cleaner Arthur Tong over what he described as " too much starch " in his laundry . When Tong denied that the clothes were overstarched , Rosenblatt suddenly leapt over the countertop and , without warning , began maniacally slapping the dry cleaner about the face and chest .
