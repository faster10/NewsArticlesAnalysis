" Every once in a while , he ' ll say something that ' ll actually make you laugh , " bar patron Tami Neff said . " I liked it when Jerry Rice caught a pass last week , and the announcers were talking about how he was the oldest receiver ever in the NFL , and Glenn said , ' When 600 years old you are , so good you will catch , hmmm ? ' like Yoda from Star Wars . I have to admit , I laughed , even though he made the exact same joke about Cris Carter a couple weeks before . "
