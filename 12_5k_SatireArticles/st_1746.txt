" Time and time again Braley has told us he ' d always be there to provide for us , but then whenever we need him most surprise , surprise he ' s not here , " said constituent Ellen Deaver , adding that Braley " waltzed into town Tuesday like he ' d never left " and offered no apology for his prolonged absence . " And when he does come around , he makes all these promises about how things are going to get better and how we mean everything to him , but then he splits again . Meanwhile , the roads and bridges he ' s been swearing he ' ll fix for months are still a mess , and he ' s way overdue on that stimulus money he told us he ' d send . "
