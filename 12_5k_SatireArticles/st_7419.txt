Yeppers , it ' s all about a man wearing a rubber during sex . It ' s not fail proof , but it ' s a lot better than going bare back . Produced for Norway by the Swedish Association for Sexuality Education , this PSA could easily be shown on American TV , with the simple replacement of the message at the end being translated from the Norwegian language to King ' s English . Ditto for all of the U . K . and actually , every other country in the world . Simply use the penis blasting drama as is , with a young guy crying " Ugh ! " after every scene , replace the written advisory at the end with the mother tongue of the country in which the commercial is aired , and anyone in the world will surely get the point . The drama is totally transparent . Rude , crude , and maybe even revolting , but it ' s very clear .
