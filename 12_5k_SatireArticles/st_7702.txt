Where was I ? Ah . Another great aunt of Lolita luscious Peaches , 12 , was the late Dame Jess Yates , a sinister monk like vampire , who regularly preyed upon simple minded TV audiences in the 12th century , when everybody had goitres and ate raw turnips and worshipped Dame Jess , as he mesmerised them on Sundays , playing his organ like the Phantom of the Opera in the Dark Ages TV show Stars on Sunday . Did I say the audiences worshipped him ( yes you did Ed . ) ?
