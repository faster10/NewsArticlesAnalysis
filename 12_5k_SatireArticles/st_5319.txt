" Between my job at a home improvement store , painting houses on the weekends , and shouting ' Miami Beach ' through an Auto Tune filter until I ' m hoarse , I ' m barely keeping my head above water , " said 42 year old Michael Erickson of Scottsdale , AZ , who noted that he ' s grateful to even have the opportunity to pick up a handful of hours with Pitbull every week given the amount of musical collaboration work that lately has gone to overseas workers or Pharrell . " Clocking out of my regular job at 5 and then flying off to Las Vegas to serve as Pitbull ' s hype man at the Billboard Music Awards isn ' t easy , but it ' s just a sacrifice I have to make if I have any chance of paying off my mortgage .
