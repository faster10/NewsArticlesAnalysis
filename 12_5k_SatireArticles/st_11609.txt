Perhaps most stunning of all , an entire holiday had sporadically spawned in honour of my great family ' s legacy and achievement in the 1960 ' s , when I was just starting to dominate the world of business . I learned that , Kwanzaa , a December holiday dedicated to Black community and togetherness , honours me every year by the lighting of candles , each with their own significance and meaning taken from my life ' s oeuvre . I am thankful that people gather yearly around the same time as the birth of Jesus , and instead , honour me , regardless of how dumb the name sounds .
