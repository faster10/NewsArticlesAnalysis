" This really puts us in position for a very lucrative run , " wrote Brooks in the September October issue of Heartbeats , the FLS Foundation ' s bimonthly newsletter . " We can expect three or four good years of impassioned spokesmanship from Ted , followed by several months of heartrending images of his brave , final battle with FLS the kind of thing that really jerks tears and gets donations pouring in .

Then there ' s the cover of People , guaranteed . All told , that translates to somewhere in the neighborhood of 500 million in free advertising and promotion . "
