Speaking through a surgical mask to conceal his identity , heart surgeon Mr Myocardial Infarction told of regular manipulation of the hospital ' s clock . " It ' s true , " said Mr Infarction , " the clock on my wall is set to go backwards , so I ' m seeing more folk that are actually coming to me , and the government think I ' m treating people before they ' ve fallen ill . Which is good as I get to have September off . "
