Russell Brand is 13 , and a pupil of Lesser Witt Comprehensive School in Paignton . He was recently suspended from the school because he , and a classmate , Johnny " Jonathan " Ross , aged 14 , took time out to get the big blue train all the way to London , saying they were making a radio show as part of their Media Studies GCSE course . However , after gorging themselves on Sunny D and Haribo all morning , they were , as one onlooker said , " quite hyper " by the time they arrived in London , proceeding to go to see a nursie to get some medicine before making their way to the place where they had alleged they were to do their school project work .
