I ' ll admit , it irks me a little that not once on the set of Emotional Arithmetic , Nuremberg , Heidi , or Dreamscape did someone come up to him and say " hey , you ' re that guy from The Battle of Britain . " Why am I the only one getting the short end of the stick here ? Just once , I would like someone to go up to Mr Sydow and say " hey , aren ' t you the guy who played Mike Wallace in The Insider ?
