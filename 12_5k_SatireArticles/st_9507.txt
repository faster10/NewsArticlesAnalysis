Since we are part of the universe , logic would dictate that the whole universe is part of the book and for every book there is an author . Logic shows that this universe was created by a race of intelligent life forms who are alien to all living things in the universe . Logic would also dictate that the universe is scripted and randomness is an illusion to produce a type of reality . Logic also dictates that scripted objects are not alive , but represent the illusion of life . This explains why there is so much religion on this earth pointing to creators . The people that created the universe find it fascinating to imagine objects in the universe similar to humans trying to worship and understand them through the illusion of religious believes . This means that other worlds across the universe were scripted to rationalize creation and the creators .
