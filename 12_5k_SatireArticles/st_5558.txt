" Tennis is all well and good , and yes , I ' m great at it , and sure , I ' ve made millions of dollars playing this sport , but when you get right down to it , it ' s just a game of human Pong , " Federer said . " On the rare occasion that I hear the roar of the crowd during one of my matches , I like to pretend I ' ve just hurdled into the end zone , or sank a three pointer at the buzzer , or hit a home run to win the game .
