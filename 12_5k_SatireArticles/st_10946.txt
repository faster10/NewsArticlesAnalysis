N . sanctioned village idiots with an ongoing observable IQ of 2 . 0 will thoroughly enjoy while either being carefully protected by a properly installed highly absorbent drop cloth , and or , ( in New Jersey only ) treated to a well placed direct hit kick in the nuts , a source close to Saudi policy ( and , surprisingly enough or maybe not so , once you think about it at least 2 of the 3 most well traveled primary orifices featured on at least one , or more , of the currently available Kardashians again , another story ) said on Tuesday .
