Leading neo conservative commentator , Irving Keyhole , has waded into the debate and criticized those who demonize the U . S . for its large nuclear arsenal , yet sit back and allow rogue countries such as Iran , Syria and North Korea , to amass millions of shoes in a vast and sinister network of factories , warehouses , and retail outlets . " Nuclear bombs are one of the safest and most humane weapons in the world " , he says . " Indeed , no one has been killed or attacked by a nuclear weapon since 1945 . Yet thousands have suffered from the pain and indignity of shoe attacks , and our critics say nothing . There is something wrong with this picture . "
