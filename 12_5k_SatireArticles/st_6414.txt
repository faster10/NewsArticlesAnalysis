" I ' ve been looking forward to this day for a while , " said 42 year old Kevin Washington , who added that he really didn ' t want to talk about why he was jumping off the Empire State Building but confirmed his plans to go through with it . " I actually tried to jump off it about eight months ago , but I got caught and had to go through this whole mental evaluation thing . It was a real pain . I was told to come back on Suicide Day when it would be smooth sailing . "
