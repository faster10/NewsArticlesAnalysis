" Like every professional basketball player , I grew up watching and idolizing Yao Ming , " former Chicago Bulls player Michael Jordan has surely said . " His play reminds me of the ancient Cao Cao poem , ' Walking From Xiamen And Looking At The Blue Sea . ' The poem ends , ' The path of the sun and moon , seems to come from within . The splendid Milky Way , seems to come from inside . Oh , I am so lucky , to be singing my song ! ' "
