NBA officials say the ball initially bounced near the Izod Center sideline , where Nets guard Bobby Simmons jumped , turned , and saved the ball , but inbounded it at a severe enough angle that it struck Knicks forward Al Harrington ' s shoe . The ball was then sent high into the air , ricocheting in turn up the arena ' s aisles , into the concession area , out the front entrance , through the parking lot , and on to I 495 East towards Manhattan , leaving multiple flailing players in its wake .
