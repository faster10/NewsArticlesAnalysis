" This is unacceptable ! " , exclaimed Phelps . " It is obvious that Chuck has drawn inspiration from the Westboro congregation and my own messages of hatred for those our God hates . I first had the inspiration to not only build a camp for degenerates to slowly expire from this life but to also place a bounty , or ' Soul Exchange Fee ' , if you will , on anyone supporting the degenerate lifestyle . What Chuck has done is usurp my ideas , put my devoted congregation in a position of demotion in the eyes of our loving , yet judgemental Lord , and therefor reduce the income of Westboro Baptist Church by hundreds if not tens of hard earned dollars .
