" I think Holmgren and I would make an interesting team , " Favre said . " He could teach me a lot . We could learn from each other . And I know Ron Wolf would have my back . If , say , our number one receiver gets knocked out for the season in Week 7 , I believe Wolf would go right after a great veteran free agent , like maybe Andre Rison , to give us an edge in the playoffs . I can almost guarantee that . "
