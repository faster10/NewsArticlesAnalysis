Immediately following the escape , the physical body of the footballer was apparently observed sitting alone in the hotel lounge reading a paperback by the popular " Chick Lit " novelist Marian Keyes . Natalia Marchenko , an employee of the hotel said , " He was suddenly a different man . First of all he tripped carrying a tray of drinks and spilt red wine down his trousers , then he declined to sign an autograph on a woman ' s breasts in case his mother found out about it . " Another eyewitness , Isydora Lippnik claimed , " He kept getting his words mixed up but managed to talk to me for a full 10 minutes without realising he had a booger sticking out the end of his nose .
