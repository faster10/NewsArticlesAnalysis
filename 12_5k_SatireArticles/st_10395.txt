Poor , inner city neighborhoods have always been a haven for street gangs . Residents typically do not have the community resources nor the support of the city to protect themselves . What makes this situation unique is the origin of these groups . Typically gangs are bred from within the community . " When dealing with gang members , you ' re usually working with individuals that grew up in the neighborhood , " says Lola Hollander , a social worker for the District . " These gang members appear to have traveled from the DuPont Circle area and from as far away as the Chelsea neighborhood in New York or the Castro District of San Francisco . They appear to be well funded and very , very organized . "
