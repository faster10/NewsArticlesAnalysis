Forking is similar to spooning , but instead of the your bodies resting side by side , one partner ( almost always the woman ) is laying on her back with one arm behind her head and the other one somewhere on her partners leg or hip . Both partner ' s legs are intertwined together somewhat sexually , but in the end one of the two will invariably become uncomfortable in this position ( most likely the woman when circulation to her arm cuts off and her arm becomes numb . )
