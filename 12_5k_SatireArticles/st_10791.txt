A turning point in Searcey ' s demeanor occurred at a Spec ' s liquor store in Houston about two years ago , where Searcey began to get belligerent with his victims . The clerk ' s name was Harold Anderson , and he remembered the whole nerve racking ordeal from start to finish . " This guy came in and demanded the contents of my register . He had a big gun and a comedy routine that stunk . " Anderson recalled . " He kept yelling at me to laugh at his jokes or he would blow my head off . I thought I ' d better do what he said to keep my head on , so I laughed my ass off . The guy thanked me for laughing and with a bow , he quickly left with 500 bucks and a bottle of cheap Scotch . "
