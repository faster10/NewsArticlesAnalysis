Walter de la Merton , head of Eco Impactive Research at the college says that the coins just evaporate when left in the sun too long . " The base alloy mix was fine in the years prior to Global Warming , but are a bad choice today " . Although a trade secret , the alloys include copper , zinc , lead and coal tar . The closure of Britain ' s Coal Mining Industry , by Clement Attlee in the 1920 ' s has lead to a shortage of coal tar , and no new five pence coins have been issued .
