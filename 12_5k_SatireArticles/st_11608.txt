I ' ve always been a student of history . My book , Rise to Greatness : The History of Canada from the Vikings to the present , illustrates the deep impact the Black name has on today ' s world , and of how little importance anyone else was . Through my extensive research , I have learned that the Blacks , such as myself , were responsible for creating many of the world ' s most cherished art forms . The Blues , Jazz and Rock and Roll , all have their roots in the Black family . And perhaps most fascinating , when my Black cousins invented those influential and soul stirring musical genres , there were quite poor , making ( adjusted for inflation ) less than 2 . 5 million a year , as struggling White Anglo Saxon Protestant business owners , in a world systematically turned against them . I look at my own life and my heart sinks seeing how little has changed , myself a casualty of history ' s vicious repetition .
