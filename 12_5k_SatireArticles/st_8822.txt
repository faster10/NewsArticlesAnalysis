The documentary will feature Kyle meeting inmates on death row where Kyle will patronize and humiliate the inmates for the entertainment of Jeremy Kyle ' s profoundly thick audience and presumably nobody else with an IQ higher than 55 . Jeremy Kyle will also stand by on a number of the inmates ' executions and call them " scum " as the electricity passes through their bones , boils their insides and ultimately kills them to death . During some of these executions Kyle will burn a picture of a long dead relative or spoon feed the roasting inmate a cat turd pot noodle and in one instance he will even do the barbaric act of eating a scotch egg and then breathing it in the face of the inmate making it the only smell less favorable than the smell of their own burning flesh .
