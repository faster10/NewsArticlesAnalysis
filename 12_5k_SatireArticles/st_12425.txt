I know there are many out there , especially in the more conservative sphere , that regard me with disdain . I don ' t fit into the traditional Republican box that the wingnuts who have hijacked my party think all Republicans should . For the last four years , I ' ve been calling for Republicans to stop concentrating on social issues . I am a single woman in my 20s and that fact alone gave me the perspective that I don ' t want to regulate a woman ' s right to choice . I am pro life , but because life is complicated , that choice is between a woman and her idea of a higher power . I believe if Roe vs . Wade were repealed , abortion would still go on . I care more about my economy , national security , and fiscal conservatism than I do about what other woman do with their bodies . It ' s not my place , and I don ' t believe it ' s the government ' s place , to make such decisions .
