The pilot of the plane , Captain Mohammed Benjamin al Buttoni who has since been revealed to be a Jihadi sympathiser had plotted to crash the plane into the twin towers at Kuala Lumpur . The plan was to bring down the twin towers in a chilling echo of the September 11th attacks , but only as he approached the towers did it dawn on him that you need two planes to bring down two towers . Now blinded by indecision the deranged Captain decided he would attempt to hit both towers simultaneously , but he then managed a feat previously thought impossible as his completely full passenger jet screamed straight through the gap between the towers at 650 mph . This delighted the diners in the 185th floor restaurant who assumed the astounding fly by was part of the evenings entertainment .
