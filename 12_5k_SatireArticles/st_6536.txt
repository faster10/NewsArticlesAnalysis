" It ' s true they tend to let their opponent hang in there , scoring just enough to make the game interesting , " said Colts defensive coordinator Ron Meeks . " They usually win in the fourth quarter , and although they win by an average of 23 points , it ' s almost always a one score game with 10 minutes to go . If we can contain their tricky Human Cannonball Blitz , penetrate their ingenious Linebacker Pyramid run defense , and interrupt their insidious pattern of combined referee depantsing and flagrant pass interference , we know we can play them close .
