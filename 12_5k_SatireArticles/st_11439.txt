Pachauri prefaced his retirement from the climate change business with what he said was a cabal of international dimensions . " I am not wanted here . North Carolina State University is annulling my Industrial Engineering and Economics degrees , and has disinvited me from stepping foot on its campus . The annulment leaves me jobless and without credentials . New York City police issued me a parking ticket , for the first time ! My publisher has remaindered my novel , Return To Almora , because they say Indians are ashamed to buy it . I don ' t know why . It has lots of sex in it . France has asked that I return the Legion of Honor medal it awarded me for my climate efforts , and Toyota and Deustche Bank have barred me from offering them more advice on how to be environmentally responsible .
