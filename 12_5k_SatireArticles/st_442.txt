" When we first met , I knew there was something special about Pete he was like a big teddy bear you just wanted to tuck into bed , " Hyams explained . " That ' s not to say we don ' t still have our problems . Sometimes he throws a tantrum when he doesn ' t want to do the dishes , and I have to discipline him . But when he falls asleep with his head in my lap , it ' s all worth it . "
