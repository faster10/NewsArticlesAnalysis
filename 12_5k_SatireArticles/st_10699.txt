" In 2008 , twenty six women were murdered or went missing while on online prostitution endeavours " states Davies . " It ' s not safe out there in the cyber world , we do not want these young women risking their lives to pay off their student loans . " Conversely , approximately 2000 governors , senators , politicians , and civil servants discreetly hire prostitutes each month , " and that ' s just an approximation , we suspect the numbers are actually much higher . What this means is that we already have a blazing market for young , amateur girls we figured why not pair them with powerful chieftains who are seeking harmless sexual satisfaction , and in turn wipe their debts free ?
