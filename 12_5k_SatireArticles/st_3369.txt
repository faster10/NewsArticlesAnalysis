" Leslie was totally crying , " said Katie Jacobsen , 19 , one of Heenan Lynn ' s roommates at the Tralfamadore Co Op housing facility . " She said Amanda had been acting weird and avoiding her all month . Then she said Amanda told her she wanted to re evaluate their relationship . Leslie said maybe it ' s because their sex life was so bad . I never knew this , but , apparently , Amanda wasn ' t ever really all that affectionate in private . Isn ' t that strange ? The way she ' d yell and scream at rallies , I always assumed Amanda was a total lesbian sexual dynamo . "
