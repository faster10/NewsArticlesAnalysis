Founded in 1821 by James McGill , a prominent member of the Chateau Clique . A group of Tories who ruled Montreal with a catty fist in the early 1800s , the Chateau Clique crushed all resistance from the Chateau Geeks , the Chateau Jocks and the Chateau Stoners . The university library maintains the only known copy of James McGill ' s personal 1824 " burn book , which contains such cutting remarks as , " I remember when Anglican Archbishop of Quebec Jacob Mountain could fit into a size 2 frock , but of course back then he was called Jacob Hill , " They say William McGillivray is a fur trader , but I just say he needs a Brazilian , and " Prominent banker Horatio Gates is a full bag of slut .
