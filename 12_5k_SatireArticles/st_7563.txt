" Popeye became extremely ill several days after eating a can of spinach he had with him at a local tavern . He became weak and bedridden , at which time his nephews and I removed all of the spinach from his home . Still , he was able to produce a can from thin air as he always does , and he ate it while we were all in another part of the house . He called out to us and mumbled something we could not understand . He reached out for his corncob pipe and clearly said , ' Me life was so much simpler in black and white . ' He then closed his eyes and passed on .
