" I get the recipes for ' Homemaker ' s Helper ' off the wire , so I can ' t really claim credit for them , " Schoepke said . " And I do the Who , What Where society column , but my name ' s not on it , because I feel it ' s better off attributed to a fictional character so it remains consistent through the years . I also leave my name off the movie reviews I write because , although I do write them quite regularly to help Wendell out , I don ' t want to get into any conflicts over negative reviews with local theater owner Tim Hough , who ' s a good friend .
