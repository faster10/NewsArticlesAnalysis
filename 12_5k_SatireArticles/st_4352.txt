" This year we ' re making the pills a little stronger because not all the candidates were weeded out right away , " said Tim Bernard of Thrive Academy in Washington , D . C . , a public charter that had 200 elementary school students apply for eight open spots last year . " Some kids would seem fine , we ' d extend them an official offer of admission , and then a few days later they ' d start hallucinating or slurring their speech . Meanwhile parents are scared sick we ' re going to rescind their kids ' offers because too many applicants survived . "
