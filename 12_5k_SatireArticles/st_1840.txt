" You know , we ' re not really married to the name Motor City anymore , either , " said Duggan , claiming that Detroit would gladly become " Ladder City or " Deck Sealant City if need be . " I was just talking with some residents the other day about how we could easily become the pool supply capital of the world . There are thousands of pools in the United States , and they each need to be cleaned , right ? We could make the chlorine , or the pool skimmers , or that long vacuum thing that sucks stuff off the bottom , or those big covers that go over the pools when it ' s winter and they ' re not being used all right here in Detroit .
