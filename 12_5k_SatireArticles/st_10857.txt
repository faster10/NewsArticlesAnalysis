Senator Dissiplin continues on to explain that this new law is part of a wider movement for reform and equality in US schools nationwide . " The goal of our education system , and all education systems , is to make our students into gender neutral , race neutral , perfect English speaking hollow shells to be filled with whatever their duties are , as assigned to them by their appointed employer . The plans have already been drawn up for how this can be accomplished . Students will mandatorily have their skin dyed green , the most race neutral color . Prosthetics will be fitted to the the student ' s bodies and faces , creating confusion over which gender they are . Their hair will be cut to shoulder length , and they will all wear completely black uniforms with tracking devices and small surveillance cameras in them so parents and teachers can monitor them at every moment of their lives . Our students will be among the brightest and most beautiful in all the land . "
