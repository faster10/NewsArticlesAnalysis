" The possibilities are endless ! " Says Anthony Brown , VP of marketing at Under Armor . " We have now only scratched the surface of what ' s possible with this new technology . With the release of The True Commitment Shirt coming out later this month a similar shirt designed for athletes with more ambitious fitness goals we definitely have our hands full . However , I excitedly anticipate the development of this same technology adapted to running shorts that will burn body fat , as well as a lead core and iron plated sports bracelet that builds arm strength . The arm bracelets are already ready for production we are just looking for the perfect slogan to imprint on them . "
