" Look at sea turtles , a species rapidly disappearing due to pollution and poaching , " Aberg said . " Several years ago , EcoToys Inc . introduced Sam The Super Sea Turtle , a green turtle , or Chelonia mydas , complete with a tag describing its natural habitat and status as an endangered species . It was so well received that the company then introduced Louie The Loggerhead , a large headed , brownish red turtle better known as Caretta caretta . That , in turn , was followed up with Lepidochelys kempi , a small , gray Atlantic ridley named Bo Ridley . Store shelves that were once devoid of sea turtles are now teeming with all manner of them . "
