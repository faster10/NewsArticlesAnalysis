" At the end of the day , " said Matthew Matthews , son of Bernard , and CEO of the largest turkey farm in the world , " a dead turkey is a dead turkey . If we can sell turkeys to another ten million more Britains by killing it in a certain way that ' s still humane , we ' ll do it . We used to slice their head off . It wasn ' t very precise . Now we cut three quarters through their neck , same effect , more precise , and Muslims can have a turkey burger . It doesn ' t affect the burger in any way . It ' s still tastes like fat and crap .
