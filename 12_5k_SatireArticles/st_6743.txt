Mull , whose wife , Brenda , 32 , forced him to enter the garish scented candle store while en route to the food court , said he attempted to run from the shop shortly after hearing the initial gunfire , only to find the killer had moved toward the display of balsam and cedar decorative votives , effectively blocking the exit . The shooter then proceeded to fire a loaded automatic shotgun into the store , striking Mull in the leg and torso and destroying a table full of ceramic potpourri warmers .
