Senator Clinton , best known for numerous congressional hearings regarding accidental suicides within the White House Staff , shady real estate deals , and her residence on the River Denial , offered her thirty five years of " monster busting " experience when asked to explain how she knew with any confidence that she was , in fact , not a monster . With calm certainty , Senator Clinton declared , " I have known monsters , and they have always been part of the vast right wing conspiracy cobbled together to bring an end to the Clinton dynasty . Since I am the Clinton dynasty , I can not , therefore , be a monster " .
