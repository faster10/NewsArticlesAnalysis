Asked for comment , God said : " This kind hearted child ' s simple prayer hath moved Me . Never before have I seen such faith . His trusting soul , so full of innocent devotion to Me , hath offered seventy times seven prayers asking , ' God ? Can I please walk again ? ' It was indeed right and fitting that I , in My infinite wisdom , should share with him the One True Answer to this long repeated question he put before Me . "
