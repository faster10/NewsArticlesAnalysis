Eloise Altoids woke early , showered , and quickly dressed in a brand new set of surgical scrubs . She was excited because today she was designated to work alongside Dr Ward in the Moorview Infirmary . She wasn ' t a great fan of Ward , his detached demeanor , and insolent attitude toward most staff kept people away , and from getting too close . In some respects Altoids thought he was a little creepy too . She adjusted her makeup one more time , adding a little more foundation powder to cover a wide swatch of hickeys she had on both sides of her neck . Her lipstick was a pale blush that highlighted her violet eyes . Lastly , she hung her new stethoscope around her neck and closed the door to her room . She thought about the opportunity and wanted to thank the Administrator for allowing her the chance to assist a full fledged physician as a surgeon ' s assistant . As a first year medical student , exposure and teaching were important first steps . Her pace increased as she heard the whine of Herbie ' s bus coming up the road .
