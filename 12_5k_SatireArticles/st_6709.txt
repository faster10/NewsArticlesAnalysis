" Should we determine that a nation has been giving refuge to this fiend or fiends , as the case may be we will effectively be at war with that nation , " Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ( D SD ) said . " Then again , what if we declared war on Afghanistan and they didn ' t send anyone to fight us ? It ' s plausible that we could declare war on them , but they wouldn ' t go to war with us , since they weren ' t the ones who actually attacked us . Who would our soldiers even shoot ? "
