Haddy also made it a habit to never hire a girl who had a tattoo ( EDITOR ' S NOTE : Of course back then , it was virtually unheard of for a woman to have a tattoo , and only the most hardcore of whores had them and then it was a little flower the size of a dime which was on an extremely intimate part of her body , that no one but a ' customer ' would ever see . . . boy oh boy have things changed ) .
