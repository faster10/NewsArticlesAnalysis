U . S . Secretary of Small Furry Animal Behavior Jerry Lester admits that he was skeptical at first . " These reports kept coming in , but I figured the witnesses were just a bunch of bored farmers who had been drinking some bad moonshine , " said Lester . " But after last week ' s incident in the park , I began to understand the magnitude of what we may be dealing with . " Lester went on to explain that he had paused in his walk through the park to stop and watch a squirrel as it climbed a tree . Just as he resumed his stroll , he heard a loud cracking sound , after which he was hit by a branch that the squirrel had dropped from above .
