" We determined that we could apply the rollback concept first to wages , simply by issuing pay stubs which show what an employee ' s earnings would have been , with a slash drawn through that number and a cute little illustration of a smiley face dressed up like Zorro , having just run his sword through the old number , producing the desired slash ' effect . Underneath that , there would be a line with the employee ' s new rolled back ' pay amount , with a winking smiley face symbol to the right of the number . We can start by reducing wages by 5 across the board ( not counting the salaries of upper management of course ) , translating to an across the board savings to the end consumer for all Wal Mart products .
