Larry has used the Internet to assist friends , as well . " Last week , we had a houseguest who was wondering if there were any Jesuit colleges in Ohio , " Wisniewski said . " All I had to do was open up my AOL software , enter my password , point the browser to www . yahoo . com , and click on Society Culture , followed by Religion Spirituality . From there , I had only to click Faiths Practices , then Christianity , then Denominations Sects , and then Catholic . Then I simply clicked on Orders , Jesuits , Colleges Universities , Ohio , and boom , right there in front of me are Xavier University in Cincinnati and John Carroll University in Cleveland . "
