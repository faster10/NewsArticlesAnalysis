When asked why he felt the need to break wind in a place known for reverence to Diety , Pissgums said " I don ' t know why people are raising a big stink about this . After all , God did create my body and is responsible in the end for people farting . A few people giggled after the first few , so I decided to have some fun with it . It was a lot more entertaining than anything that the boring priest had to say . All in all , it was a blast ! "
