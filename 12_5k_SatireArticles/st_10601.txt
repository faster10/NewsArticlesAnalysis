First Lady Laura Bush was at the president ' s bedside . " Laura , I ' ve got something to tell you about that time we visited France . Remember at that big state dinner , the men all gathered after the meal for cigars and ? Well , I really don ' t know how to tell you this , but they brought in this goat , and I just don ' t know what got into me , but when Jacques got finished with the goat and invited me for seconds , I just went and . Oh Laura , I ' m so sorry ! Do you think I might have caught Mad Cow disease from just two minutes with that goat ? I know you told me to be careful about staying away from cows , so I thought it would be OK to have a little fun with a goat . How did I know . . . ? "
