" We as a nation need to experience some sort of closure , " said Marcy McGinnis , CBS senior vice president of news coverage . " And no one needs that more than the people who lost loved ones on Sept . 11 . They will never forget what happened , but they need to move on and feel whole again . They need the sort of tasteful tribute montage set to Bruce Springsteen ' s ' Empty Sky ' that we ' ve got planned at CBS . "
