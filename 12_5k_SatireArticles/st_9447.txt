The future is uncertain for Terry Snogawd , whose family and friends are deeply entrenched in the atheistic not church . His not godfather is highly esteemed atheist author Godfrey X . Zistents , whose works include Mere Atheism and The Purpose Drivel Life . His father , Darruss Snogawd , is dean of the Harvard School of Irreligious Studies , and his son is up and coming ACM ( Atheistic Contemporary Music ) star Darryl B . Nogawd , who recently dropped the " S " from the beginning of his last name in hopes of disassociating himself from his disgraced father .
