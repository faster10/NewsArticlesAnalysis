" There are fewer kids at this school , so the bullies can really get to know you well , " said Christiano , recounting an incident last month in which a bully pulled him aside , took the time to go over all his personal shortcomings , and made sure to stay there alongside him until he was on the verge of tears . " Before , guys would just call me a dicklicker , but it would never really sink in . But these bullies make me repeat it out loud ' Yes , I ' m a dicklicker ' until they ' re sure I ' ve got it . "
