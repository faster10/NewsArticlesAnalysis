" Charlie makes a lot of changes that are totally arbitrary . A perfect example is my paragraph on removing and cleaning the crumb tray , " Leff said . " He changed ' scrubbing pad ' to ' scouring pad ' purely for the sake of change , as though he needed to feel like he was an editor . I specifically asked Charlie about his thought process behind that one , and he couldn ' t even give an answer . He just said , ' I don ' t know , something about " scrubbing pad " just didn ' t sound right . ' "
