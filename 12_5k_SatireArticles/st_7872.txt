The continuing problem of marketing Banderas to the American heartlands was recently highlighted when a cinema goer shot the screen of the cinema , because they felt he was a Mexican immigrant and didn ' t trust him . Sensing growing hostility from the American cinemagoer , Banderas felt he was never ever going to fit in and decided he wanted to go back to his roots . In an emotional phonecall to Almodobar , through a translator , he begged to be given the role . Almodovar lectured him on the betrayal of his country and instructed him that he needed to return to being a Latin Lover and a connoisseur of Spanish stereotypes .
