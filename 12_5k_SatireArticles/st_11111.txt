Putin has an answer at the ready . " Oh I will continue on messing with the EU and America . I ' ll see how their response is to my actions in Syria , then maybe I ' ll try a couple more land grabs . I always wanted an ice free port in northern Norway for instance . Another one on an island in the Arabian Sea wouldn ' t be bad either . Hell , I might even go for taking over Guantamo Bay would be cool too ! Imagine the headaches I could give the new U . S . President with a base only 90 miles from Florida ! How about you ? "
