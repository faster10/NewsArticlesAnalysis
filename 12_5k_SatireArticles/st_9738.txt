Rupert Murdoch clarified his opinion on the matter , " We are a business after all , so our customers interests will drive content . It also ties into the original question of bias . " Asked to clarify Murdoch explained , " our perspective also helps draw interest to stories that may otherwise be ignored . For example : If you present a story about , let ' s say nutrition , it is going to garner interest from a certain demographic that cares about that sort of thing . Now , take that same story and ask Sarah Palin what her opinion on nutrition is , and it is going to draw interest from a much greater number of demographics . It could become a nationwide story that appeals to many different outlets for different reasons . News Corp could use a story like this to expose how uninformed Mrs Palin is about the topic , while Fox News could use it to highlight how important good nutrition is . There is a lot of money to be made from a story like that . That is why we love quoting politicians so much . They will garner positive and negative interest from both sides of the aisle , which is all the same to us . It all generates profit . "
