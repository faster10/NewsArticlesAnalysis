Hans Spiegel revealed that the Eurovision Song Contest , like the World Cup , will be expanding under the control of Sapp Bladder and co . " Yes . Also the Song Contest will expand to more of the world . We have accepted China , and also Qatar , Saudi Arabia and India for the next contest of 2011 . We feel that there is much to be gained by the relations with these emergent nations , and less with the old countries who won the world wars in the olden day when the singing was by your Vera Lynn and the George Formby with his teeth and dumpkopff sticks of Blackpool rock innuendo and silly ukulele playing . Also it was the Jolly Old Arsenal with the brylcreem and the Dixie Dean who would headbutt the muddied leather ball with the laces and knock the goalkeeper Fatty Foulke into the goals and the Englischers did not salute Herr Hitler .
