" I love finding old classmates and seeing what they ' re up to , " said Peros , who regularly skims the " Work and Education " section of profiles without reaching the soul crushing conclusion that his own accomplishments are pathetic by comparison . " And if I ' m not friends with them already , I ' ll send them a request . I figure , what ' s to lose ? Even if you ' re rejected , it ' s presumably just because they don ' t remember you , or else like to keep their friend list limited to people they know really well . Why else would they reject you ? Right ? "
