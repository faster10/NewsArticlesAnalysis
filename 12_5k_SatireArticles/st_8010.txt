One such student vying for the honor of the winning idea is young David Mersch . He has a startling concept drawn from a summer backpacking trip he took in New Zealand several years ago . There he experienced Nature ' s " glow worm " caves which are native to many of the caverns of that country . Early explorers had , in their own way , stumbled upon the amazing luminous properties of these pudgy , wiggly and sticky creatures . History tells of one lost , lone explorer when his last light failed him , he in despair looked to the rock ceiling above him , expecting only sheer blackness . Instead , he found an array of small , yellow greenish lights . . . fantastic glowing worms ! The bright torch light had barred his eyes from noticing their continual presence . He followed the glowing lights , and in time this led him to the escape from his subterranean prison .
