" I ' ll admit , I was under pressure to shorten the title to something more commercial , like the snappier Scenes From A Jiffy Lube mostly from my dad , " said Rivers , speaking from Muddy Waters , a local coffee shop prominently featured in the film and a favorite haunt where he often goes to think , people watch , and spend his parents ' money on imported blends . " But I couldn ' t let vulgar market considerations dictate the terms of this project . I wanted the title to reflect the very spirit of independent filmmaking itself , the ' rising above ' of everyday mundanities in the pursuit of something far greater : the singular artistic freedom that comes from not actually having to work for a living .
