Congress began funding the monkey collider in 1983 , after Reed convinced lawmakers that the U . S . was lagging behind the Soviet Union in monkey colliding technology . Funds were quickly allocated so that Reed could spend a week procuring monkeys on Florida ' s beautiful Captiva Island . Though Reed returned with a great tan and a beautiful young fiancee , he reported that there were no monkeys to be found on the sunny Gulf Coast island . Congress funded subsequent trips to the Cayman Islands , Bora Bora and Cancun , but these searches also yielded negative results .
