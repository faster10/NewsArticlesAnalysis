" This stuff ' s in such bad shape , it ' s hard to even enjoy it for the kitsch factor , " Litt said . " I saw a can of Lincoln Logs over there and got excited . But when I opened it , there were only , like , three or four logs and a bunch of other crap a Tinkertoy wheel with gum stuck in the holes , about a dozen bent Uno cards , a pair of lens less sunglasses , a couple jigsaw puzzle pieces , a marble , and a bicycle reflector .
