" Even if I don ' t do any serious exercise , I ' ll do 20 minutes of stretching , " Vanderbilt said . " That ' s a bare minimum . If I ' m lifting , then I stretch out before and after the workout . You wouldn ' t believe how many injuries could be avoided if people stretched before they worked out . If I have time , I like to stretch the muscles I ' m working out between reps . You look pretty flexible . Do you do yoga ? "
