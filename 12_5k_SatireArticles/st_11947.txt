I can already tell that dating Paulthaniel is going to be great . He said he would never leave me , and to prove it , he stuck his hand into a jar of mosquitoes ( he thought they were like fireflies and lit up at night ! So cute ! ) , scratched one of the bites , and we made a blood pact . It ' s too bad Paulthaniel is a severe hemophiliac . We spent the night in the ER , but it was definitely a memorable second date .
