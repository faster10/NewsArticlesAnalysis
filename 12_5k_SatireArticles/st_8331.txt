What Alan saw next will haunt him for the rest of his life . " I thought there were burglars in the practice room , so I picked up my cue and burst in to confront them . And that ' s when I caught the horrible sight . I seen two people on the practice table , clearly nearing an end of a frame themselves . It was difficult to make them out in the early morning light but then I heard " oh my god it ' s 1981 again " and it looked just like Davis . Then someone resembling Irvine popped up from the baulk end and I nearly died "
