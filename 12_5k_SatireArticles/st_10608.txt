He said that after his tour of Iraq he will make an ironic fashion line for hipsters who are imitating hipsters in order to pretend to not be hipsters . There is a novel in the works about this and there will be a movie version as well , which will star indie legend Joseph Gordon Levitt who will play Smith , except much more handsomely . After the fashion line , he is planning on growing the world ' s largest muttonchops and writing a poem in their honor . After this he is going to lead a revolutionary coup in some obscure Latin American country while wearing his beret so he can be featured on thousands of indie hipster shirts like Che Guevara . He wants to achieve the fullest level of meta after this and lead a coup against himself . A poetry collection will follow after this .
