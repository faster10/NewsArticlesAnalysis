Biblical scholars noted that while God certainly appreciated Mary ' s remarkable obedience , humility , and purity , He saw Erica as His soulmate , the only one who truly made Him feel understood . The lowborn daughter of an olive grower , Erica is said to have been flattered by God ' s advances , and according to the texts , did not rule out the possibility of one day having His child . But she continually put it off , reportedly saying there were still many things she wanted to do with her life before she could settle down to raise the King of Kings and Lord of Lords .
