As a goodwill offering to Discovery Communications , Fox News is lending Discovery the right to use " Fair and Balanced " in its show headlines . It is rumored that this deal was negotiated with Roger Ailes by Sarah Palin herself in the executive bedroom of Fox News because she wanted to be able to use the slogan in her shows . When asked if this was true , Sarah Palin acknowledged the fact saying , " I screwed him for Jesus so we can promote Christian values . "
