Plans for military action in Iraq mean that there will be a lot of playing on the so called shoot ' em up games , in preparation for Saddam v Bush II . This is new territory for the President , who is more used to playing baseball games and ' Mario Kart ' .

It is believed he used his Geoffrey the Giraffe loyalty points to purchase them .
