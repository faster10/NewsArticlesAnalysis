Over the course of the next few months , the fertilized female will ready herself for the eventual birth of her offspring . After procuring a larger , more comfortable nest , she will store several layers of fat to help speed up incubation and , in order to secure the constant attention of her mate , will alternate between crying and laughing until the moment of delivery . The inseminated female will also shriek several times a day about how her partner ' s family should pay for the upcoming wedding in full , though the biological purpose behind this ritual is unknown .
