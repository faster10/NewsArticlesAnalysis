As a test , we took one of Kell ' s newer computers and set a system password , installed the newest anti virus software as well as a firewall . Then we wrote a script on another computer that set all the voltages to 12 and disabled the current limit . We put the program on a jump drive , disguised as an image file , and put it on a jump drive . The anti virus program read the image and determined that it wasn ' t really an image and flagged it as a potential virus . Fair enough . Then , we disabled the anti virus software . Almost immediately , the screen went blank . A few seconds later , we heard several pops and crackles , and smoke began to come out of the back of the computer . Before we could even pull the plug , flames had begun to come out of the computer and we had to hit the computer with a fire extinguisher .
