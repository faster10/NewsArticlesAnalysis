VANCOUVER , CANUCKS Scientists have often speculated ( i . e . , theorized ) as to what might lie within Mother Earth ' s " twilight zone , " the space between her epidermis , or " upper crust , " and her dermis , or " lower mantle . " They once believed ( i . e . , hypothesized ) that the planet ' s twilight zone might contain only the cast aside ideas of Rod Serling and other " debris , " but , now that they have unearthed a gem full of water , they imagine ( i . e . , conjecture ) that the space may be filled with amniotic fluid .
