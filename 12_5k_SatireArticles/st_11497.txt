He was under no threat , his head having emerged , but his feet and legs were still inside the womb . We kept him occupied by making faces at him and making him laugh until his mother pointed out that , as with other babies , Jose was kicking out his feet in joy when he laughed . We spent the rest of the time teaching him Valenciana one is never too young to learn .
