Rocky ' s most recent attempt was last night , when he approached Lyle ' s friend , Carl , who was seated on the living room floor . Carl hadn ' t been paying attention to the dog before the incident , when Rocky attacked his arm with the enthusiasm and energy of a felon who had been recently released from prison . Carl , who was disgusted by the dog ' s advances , reacted by quickly moving his arm , sending the disappointed dog flying across the living room . An apologetic Lyle then carried Rocky outside , where he scolded the dog and imprisoned him in their fenced in back yard .
