Speaking at 10am after a brisk jog around the East End ' s former Olympic marathon route , the Chancellor grew more and more morose as he recounted the story behind his decision . " We really thought we were onto a winner with the Department for Dogshit " , he remarked ruefully . " It was set up by Clement Attlee after the war with the purpose of making sure that there was enough dog mess on the streets of Britain ' s medium sized towns . These days , there ' s very little call for that sort of thing and the whole business is horribly mismanaged . They don ' t even produce their own dogs ' eggs anymore they import the stuff from France , which is incredibly inefficient .
