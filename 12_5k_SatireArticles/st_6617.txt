Air Force general Mitchell Holt , who explained that standard operating procedures now call for the immediate deployment of a condolence drone upon determining that a prior Reaper drone attack resulted in the accidental death of one or more noncombatants . " This unit is equipped with the most sophisticated commiseration technology available , and with it we can swiftly and efficiently deliver our deepest sympathies to those who have lost a friend or family member in an erroneous or inaccurate drone strike .
