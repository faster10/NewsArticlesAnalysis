See , it ' s just that the original Ghostbusters was a big part of my childhood . Or so I ' m told by these photo albums full of pictures I no longer recognize myself in or have any emotional connection to . I mean , dark necromancy performed by hooded creeps doesn ' t actually exist , so the only conclusion I can draw is that the new Ghostbusters shit the bed so hard that it actually ruined my ability to enjoy the original movie . Not only that , but it also ruined my ability to remember 6 years of swimming lessons , the smell of my mom ' s shortbread cookies , or whether I once owned a pet cocker spaniel who loved me very much .
