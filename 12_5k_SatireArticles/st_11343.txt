President Abdul Latif was resplendent in his army uniform trimmed with gold leaf and carrying a gold cane . The eye catching ensemble was topped off by a trilby , and in his other hand he brandished a hunting rifle . In his inaugural address , Abdul Latif mixed encouragement and admonition . " My children . My Iraq . Abdul Latif loves each one of you . I am Iraq personified . I am your nation . Return my love and you shall prosper . But those who spurn it will taste hell on earth " .
