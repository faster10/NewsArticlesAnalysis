With an overall record of 105 wins and 140 losses since the days of grunge and big hair rock roll , maybe Snyder should consider selling his team to a very wealthy old rocker who knows one or two things about football . Hey , didn ' t Pink Floyd record a song way back when about " buying a football team " ? And hopefully , this celebrated musician whoever he or she may turn out to be will be an owner with a magnanimous and sensitive personality and consider ditching that that horrid racist name , Re sk ns !
