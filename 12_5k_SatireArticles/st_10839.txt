Libuse , La . Mrs Del Taylor remembers last Friday morning when , she says with a bit of nervous laughter , she discovered only four eggs and a small packet of grated American cheese in the refrigerator . Her husband Kenny was in the bathroom readying for his work day down at Zimmers Iron Works . Shortly , she knew , Kenny would be in the kitchen ready for his breakfast of bacon and eggs with wheat toast , the same lucky breakfast he enjoyed every day since landing the job of crane operator down at the plant back in December of 1974 .
