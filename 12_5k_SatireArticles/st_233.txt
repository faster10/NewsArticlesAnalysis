Vatican handlers said they first noticed signs of papal deterioration on Jan . 26 , as he deplaned at St . Louis ' Lambert International Airport upon his arrival in the U . S . After descending the airplane staircase and kissing the runway , as is papal tradition , the pope broke free of his handlers and blessed a luggage cart , a podium , a Life photographer ' s camera , the plane ' s left side landing gear , three TWA flight attendants , and two of the Swiss Guard who were attempting to release his grip on the landing struts and subdue him . Upon realizing that he was being physically restrained , the pope worked his papal signet ring bearing right hand free and blessed the entire aircraft , which now resides in its own special five story grotto under St . Peter ' s Basilica .
