Pondering the future of TV trivia , Bennett said : " One day , I envision a world in which every American knows that Happy Days was a spin off from a 1972 Love , American Style episode . A world in which the phrase ' No whammies ! ' is instantly associated by all with the ' 80s game show Press Your Luck . A world in which the importance of TV trivia is as universally undisputed as the greatness of the first three seasons of St . Elsewhere . "
