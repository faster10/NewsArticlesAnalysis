Actress Kirsten Dunst apparently is one Hollywood actress that has the ability to express an opinion that is contrary to the non traditional , liberal , feminist agenda of her industry . In an interview with Harper ' s Bazaar UK , Dunst said : " " I feel like the feminine has been a little undervalued . We all have to get our own jobs and make our own money , but staying at home , nurturing , being the mother , cooking it ' s a valuable thing my mom created . And sometimes , you need your knight in shining armor . I ' m sorry . You need a man to be a man and a woman to be a woman . That ' s how relationships work . "
