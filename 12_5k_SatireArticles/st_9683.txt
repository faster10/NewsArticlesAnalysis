Republicans have been almost unanimous in quoting that a Divine inspiration has descended upon them . Apparently this heavenly apparition was bestowed upon their golden leader , John Boehner . Mr Boehner , his eyes glowing with enlightened envisionment , has come forth upon his Republican brethren much like Moses descending Mount Sinai , and he delivered unto to them the vision that was presented to him . " My fellow conservatives , the Lord has issued unto me that we shall now strive to work together with Brother Obama to set forth things within this land that will cause it to grow and to thrive ! " Mr Boehner then held his hands out palms outward much the same way that Jesus must have when addressing his disciples .
