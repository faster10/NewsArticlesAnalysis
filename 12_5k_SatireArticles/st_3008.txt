" I saw Jerry Mathers on Entertainment Tonight a couple months ago , " said Barry Carter , 34 , of Duluth , MN . " It was weird . He still has that baby face , but he ' s , like , in his 50s now . I was like , ' Whoa , look at Jerry Mathers , he ' s getting up there in years , ' and my wife said , ' Well , aren ' t we all ? ' I guess it ' s true . I ' m not as young as I used to be , either .
