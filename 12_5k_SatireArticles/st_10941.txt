As one might guess the local retail shops in Norway is not too happy about the new fashion . Many supermarkets have been forced to hire guards . Others have quickly built a system of " air vents " to slow the customer ' s exits from the shop ( making it impossible to run off with the food ) . This has led to some cases of people just eating the stolen goods inside the shop . One went as far as to start a single use grill up in a customer rest room , in order to prepare to roast the moose meet he just stole . This kind of behavior is however discouraged by Doctor Horn , as it does not gives the exercise of running off with the products and you can ' t consume too much food this way .
