" Her teaching methods are unorthodox to say the least and possibly a federal crime , too , but she knows how to grab the kids ' attention and keep it , " said Maggie Faulkner , who had her son in the class last year . " I use to have a hell of a time getting my son to read , do his math or even stop picking his nose . But after I enrolled him in her class , I don ' t have to ask him twice to do anything . Now if I could only get him to stop wetting himself whenever he hears a loud noise . I ' ll talk to her after her trial . I bet she can help me with that too . "
