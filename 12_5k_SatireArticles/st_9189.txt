Many constitutionalists like Ron Paul claim that the federal government is violating individual choice , freedom , and liberty promised to us by the US Constitution . Proponents of this bill call this a triumph for protecting the poor , and children from obesity due to sugar consumption . Senator Harry Reid ( D Nevada ) said the following to reporters during a press conference , " Due to the increased epidemic of obesity in this country , selling sugar as a non regulated commodity has become counter productive to the Affordable Healthcare Act that is due to take affect in 2014 . " Senator Reid continued by saying , " But even more important than our countries health concerns is our nation ' s energy crisis . We need to find a viable replacement for oil that is harming the environment , and we need to become energy independent sugar provides us with a viable replacement . 99 of all sugar imported into this country and 100 domestically produced sugar will now be used to create clean burning ethanol which will then be used in our cars as a replacement for gasoline .
