When Madison or my best friend writes a letter , seals it in an envelope , and mails it to me , is this " the press " ? Certainly not . A private letter writer is not " the press . " Nor , in fact , would it be " the press " if the handwritten letter was posted on a street corner . Without " the press " and its duplication by pressure and by ink , the letter is just an open letter . It is not a protected right of the freedom of the press .
