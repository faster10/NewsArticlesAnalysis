" Things were very comfortable between Teri and me . Maybe too comfortable , " Hubrin said . " We ' d meet at the Days Inn out by the highway every Wednesday while Nancy was at her aerobics class . We ' d get together at her place on Mondays during my lunch break because that was her day off . Sometimes , on Saturdays , I ' d tell Nancy I was going jogging with my friend Henry , then go to Teri ' s apartment for a quickie . We had a nice little routine , but somewhere along the way , our infidelity had gone stale . That became painfully obvious once I met Amanda . "
