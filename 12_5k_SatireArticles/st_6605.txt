" We ' re not holding anything back , honest , " Jones said . " If there was some way to make your teeth whiter , we ' d be thrilled to offer it to you and charge you an arm and a leg for it . You ' re just going to have to come to grips with the fact that your teeth have a slight natural tint . Unless you want us to start painting your teeth with correction fluid , you ' ll have to accept that cruel fact . "
