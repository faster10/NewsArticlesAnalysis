Doggone it , all this talk about Seamus is taking away from Mitt ' s central messages : " Don ' t look at the number of jobs I eliminated when I worked at Bain . " Also , " Please don ' t focus on the tens of millions dollars I made when I gutted those companies . " And , my personal favorite , " Uh uh , I didn ' t create no universal RomneyCare health plan in Massachusetts when I was governor . No , sir . Not me . Not never . "
