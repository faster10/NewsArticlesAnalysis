Skeptics of global warming prefer the game just as it is . Jimmy Joe Johnson , a self proclaimed Tea Party activist from Madison , VA , believes that snow will continue on into the future and will remain a part of late season college football . " We got snow here this winter . A lot , " Johnson says . Referring to the two major blizzards that ravaged the Mid Atlantic states this past winter , Johnson stated , " It done snowed twice as high as my dog and I had to dig my truck out a couple times . That ain ' t warming to me " . Gore , aloft in his ( non carbon emitting ) private jet , believes that global warming was directly responsible for the blizzards in question . " Water vapor is a greenhouse gas . And as global warming continues , more water vapor is going to be in the air so that when it does get cold now , precipitation will fall as snow . But that won ' t be the case in the future , and that ' s where I have a problem " .
