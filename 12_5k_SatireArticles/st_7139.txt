" We are simply inundated with enquiries from many professions , legal mostly , barristers , judges and the like but which also include the media , finance , the armed forces , MI6 and so on . The media are particularly interested and many journalists and editors have already signed up . It has been most encouraging . Our books are full for years in advance and we are currently looking to get government to finance the building of proper training centres to take care of the overload . We are very excited . I have been liaising closely with the U . S . administration who are very keen indeed . "
