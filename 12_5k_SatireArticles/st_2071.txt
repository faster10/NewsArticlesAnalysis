" It ' s too long , the characters are interchangeable , and there ' s no third act , " Black said . " That said , it ' s hard to turn down a vampire movie , particularly one with so much softcore nudity . If I were a little studio looking for a shot in the arm , there ' s a chance I ' d option it , give it a quick coat of paint , shoot it on the cheap , and dump it straight to DVD . It won ' t do much domestically , but you could stand to recoup and then some on the international market . "
