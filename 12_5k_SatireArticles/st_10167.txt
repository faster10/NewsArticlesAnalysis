Billy Joe " Fred " Bello , a patron at the Laramie Lounge that night , explained it this way , " I comes in there , and the only free stool was near these non smoking , mean looking gals . So I alls sit there , order a brew , and lights up a smoke . Wouldn ' t ya know it , theys all start giving me them stupid fake coughs that non smokin ' gals enjoy doin ' when they see a man with a smoke . Land sakes that pisses me off ! "
