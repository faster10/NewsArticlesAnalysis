" As soon as I am Prime minister , I shall order the immediate annihilation of Iceland and the Icelanders . There are only about the same number of them as the population of Wakefield , so it will be economic to use four nuclear warheads the equivalent size of the ones used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki , and a small task force can then cap the volcanoes with concrete . That will consign the Icelander problem to history , and I know about history because I done it at University before I swopped to Law . "
