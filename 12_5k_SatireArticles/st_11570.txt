" Throwing shoes at someone is a sign of extreme contempt in Iraqi culture " , Oxford University political scientist J . Clement Cheedles said today . But added that " there is something much more sinister going on with this attack . " According to him , there is a consensus among terrorism experts that shoes used as projectiles are not to be taken lightly . Indeed , the first recorded death from a hurled shoe was in the year 482 BC in Athens , when Ankliodosus the Elder was assassinated by a jealous wife . Since then , explains Professor Cheedles , shoes have been greatly improved in their sophistication , and many people have been killed . In the last one hundred years alone , at least 7 people have died because of thrown shoes , and " the carnage continues on into this century with no sign of abating " .
