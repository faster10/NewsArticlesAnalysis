When asked why he had held that view , Mr Smith went on to explain that he had seen Mr Johnson on the BBC TV programme Have I Got News For You and had thought he seemed good fun . ' Me misses and me lives in the sticks , ' Mr Smith explained further , ' but we visits London from time to time . We think London ' s great : there ' s loads to do , lots of places to eat and , if you avoid the rush hour , it ' s got really good public transport . We knew that Boris was mayor so we sort of associated him with the fun we had when we went up to town . When he announced his plan to concrete over the Thames estuary and build an airport on it , we liked him even more . We don ' t live anywhere near London so weren ' t bothered by any problems the airport on Boris Island might cause . The idea seemed like a bit of a laugh though , and it would have been a great place to visit on one of our trips . '
