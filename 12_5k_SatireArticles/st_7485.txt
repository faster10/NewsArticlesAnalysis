Of those jurors , 72 year old Edward Salinas of Miami Beach , gave a statement on behalf of the panel . He said that " it was really difficult to come to a quick decision on this . It took a lot of long , slow , contemplation and repeat viewings of the films and the girls before we could make up our mind . We felt the need to be alone with our thoughts in our rooms while we watched the films and contemplated any suffering sustained by these two kids . "
