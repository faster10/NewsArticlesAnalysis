" From what I read specifically , pages one through 76 this computer was put through a lot of painful , torturous passages , " said Department of English graduate faculty advisor Judith Mendel , who was scheduled to meet Samoskevich on Thursday to discuss the possibility of publishing the " atrocity " in the department ' s academic journal . " Thanks to this laptop ' s valor , Jill ' s classmates or future students will never have to pick their way through dense and discursive passages about ' The Red Wheelbarrow ' and North Carolina farming communities . Also , I get to have a free lunch period Thursday . "
