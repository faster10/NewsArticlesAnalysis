Watt enters the game late in the second quarter at tight end , then shifts to quarterback as Brock Osweiler splits out wide . Watt fumbles the snap and covers it , but is immediately pounced on for the sack by Von Miller . In the second half , Watt wraps up Mark Sanchez for a sack , thus becoming the first player in NFL history to be sacked and record a sack in the same game .
