Linda Lobsterapple , a sociologist at Perdue University , has published widely on the correlation between bony , protruding jaws and gravitas . She explains gravitas as a person ' s perceived authority which intimidates others and compels them to defer to the authority figure . " Gravitas itself is best thought of as a force that acts through certain embodiments or symbols of it . Two of the most powerful such symbols are the archetypal hero ' s lantern jaws and prominent chin . Traditionally , only manly men with those facial features were admired . But now , after the feminist revolutions , women too can become famous if they possess those traits . Think of the actresses Olivia Wilde , Reese Witherspoon , Claire Danes , Minnie Driver , Jodie Foster , Rosario Dawson , Jennifer Garner , Rachel McAdams , or Angelina Jolie . Or the female news anchors Ashleigh Banfield , Amy Robach , Megyn Kelly , Melissa Theuriau , or Susan Hendricks . "
