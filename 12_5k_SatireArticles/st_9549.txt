" He ( Chris Christie ) saw me panhandling in Jersey City one day and said to me , ' Father Tyolect , how would you like to blow up the George Washington Bridge ? If you don ' t want to do it for God and country , at least consider doing it for Jesus . He still loves you . I ' ll pay you three grand a month and give you an unlimited expense account to buy all the explosives and armaments your little heart desires . That Second Amendment , Padre ' , it ' s all yours .
