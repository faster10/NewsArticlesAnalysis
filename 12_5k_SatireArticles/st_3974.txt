Porcia spends each morning with her grandmother , who drops her off at Wee Ones at 11 : 30 a . m . The girl remains there until Sweedlin picks her up between 6 and 7 p . m . , depending on whether she takes a detour to Walgreens , where a quick stop can take an hour . While Sweedlin often complains that money is too tight for new clothes for Porcia , she does budget funds for the beauty products she needs to look " professional " for work .
