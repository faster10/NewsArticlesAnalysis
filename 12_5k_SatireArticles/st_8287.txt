Aussie cricket pundit Shane Dunny sympathises with Christian . He said , " I reckon he ' s frustrated with his and the teams performances . It ' s understandable really . I used to get quite annoyed when I got out . I even used the word damn once and told a team mate to " stuff off . " I ' m not proud of that outburst . He should take some time away from the game . In the cold light of day he ' ll realise that he ' s right , cricket is a waste of time but what else can he do ? He talks about becoming an airline pilot but imagine if he got his landing a bit wrong . He ' d smash the bloody cockpit up . I don ' t think Qantas would be too happy with that . Stick with cricket fella , that ' s my advice . "
