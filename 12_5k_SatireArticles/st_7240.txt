' Well to be fair , if I tell you that , I ' ll have Brucie on the blower left , right and centre trying to get me back . Suffice to say it ' ll be somewhere hot and sweaty . . . . maybe Paul Daniels ' head now he ' s got a vacancy . Perhaps I can have a rest as well , as he ain ' t been on telly for years now , cos that ' Strictly ' stint has well aged me . I swear down I ' ve sprouted a few grey hairs after that ! '
