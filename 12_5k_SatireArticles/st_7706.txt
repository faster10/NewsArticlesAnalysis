" You do have to be careful , though if you list yourselves as a couple , everyone except your really close friends might assume you ' re a lesbian . But saying you ' re married is pretty obviously a joke , so it works out alright , " maintained the woman who has not been in a serious relationship since last April . " Also , some guys could be thrown off and think , ' Oh god , she ' s one of those chicks who does nothing but gab with her idiotic friends and hates to be away from them for more than 30 seconds ' , but once they meet me they ' ll know that ' s not the case . "
