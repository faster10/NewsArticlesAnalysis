This is how we live our lives and we believe it is how we should live our lives and this madness we sell at home and abroad as a fiction called American ' freedom ' . Our youth trash their own lives in the name of this myth and are encouraged by the film industry and media gurus to do so . Suitably conditioned they are sent overseas to die trashing the lives of others to protect the accursed lie . . . while their president goes on speaking eloquently about it over their graves , ( furious shouting and boos ) .
