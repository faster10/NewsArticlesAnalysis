" Sure , Access doesn ' t pay as much as ET . But we don ' t have to , " said Pierce , squeezing a lime slice into her margarita . " People know they ' ve stalled and that the culture just isn ' t the same . I met an ET researcher at a party last month slightly phony guy and , anyway , it was clear he didn ' t believe in the job . It ' s much more of an assembly line mentality over there : Just churn it out . And that ' s really not helped by having Bob Goen and Mary Hart at the desk . Bob ' s a poor man ' s John Tesh , and Mary , she couldn ' t say her name without a cue card . Access Hollywood anchor Pat O ' Brien is trusted and really knows his stuff . We could go live if we had to . "
