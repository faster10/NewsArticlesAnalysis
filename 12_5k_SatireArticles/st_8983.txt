" We found that one thing people said they liked about airports in other countries is the planes landing and taking off without delay , taxiing straight to the gate and the smart handlers carefully and quickly managing the luggage , " continues the statement . " Clearly there is no chance of any of that happening at Heathrow , so rather than show the planes wasting fuel in holding patterns , stacked up on the taxiways , sitting for hours on the tarmac waiting for gates , and scruffy baggage handlers huddling under a shelters smoking cigarettes , or occasionally scurrying out to throw bags onto the tarmac , we came up the the ' virual airport ' screen which obliterates the passengers view of the real world and provides the kind of experience the customers would wish for and have paid for .
