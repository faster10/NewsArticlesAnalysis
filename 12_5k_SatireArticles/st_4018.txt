" What I like most about working here is that although this job is incredibly demanding , I get to show up each day knowing we ' re really doing something meaningful , " said the man who has the ability to queue up several hours ' worth of social media posts ahead of time , allowing him to sometimes leave work as early as 2 p . m .
