" So you see , I am ready to spend a lot of money on players who are good , experienced and more importantly , should not have won any trophies before and should have no intention and ambition whatsoever of winning trophies in the future . Arsenal FC is not a club that aims to win trophies . We just try to play beautiful flowing football . Our fans have understood that perfectly well and have stuck behind us all these years . We are not worried about our fans . They will continue to support us . So right now , we are still looking for that ' right player ' who satisfies all these criteria . I am sure we will find him someday . "
