" I don ' t know about Dr Chen , but I know that Dr Kerri Bruce , who has been a real trouper through all of this , is quitting science to start a catfish farm in Louisiana .

I may still do something in science , but if I do , it ' ll probably be something easy , like re linking cigarette smoking with lung cancer , just to get my confidence back up . It ' s too early to say . I ' ll have a better idea after a month of watching the Game Show Network and eating raspberry danishes . "
