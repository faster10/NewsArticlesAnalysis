4 ) Thank you all Brexit fans for plunging all of your ex pat comrades into a situation where we will all have to apply for work visas , resident visas and broken marriages because we Brits have no right of abode anymore in the countries of our choice you are all wonderful ! I also hope you will remain forever on the island of your dreams ( my nightmares ) , and do not bother to join me for a lovely drop of Vino Tinto on the wonderful sunny beaches in viva Espana ! Enjoy your over priced English pints of piss during miserable English summers , and be careful not to drown in them when the perennial floods appear !
