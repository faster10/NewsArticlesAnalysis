" Look at these superb Anszczaks here , " said Dorian Childsworth , a photography historian at George Eastman House in Rochester , NY , as she gestured at an open portfolio of portraits . " Observe the immediacy of his work . We see closed eyes , drifting gazes , unattractively agape mouths , tucked in collars , and hair sticking up all funny . But Anszczak did not weed such imperfections out . He embraced them . In so doing , he captured the awkward hearts and souls of these individuals . These photos show an intuitive sympathy at work the mark of a true artist . "
