Pattinson told me , when no one else was around : " I am being offered a lot of roles , where i literally play the teen hunk , or the teen football capitan , and I did not feel comfortable playing those roles . So then I was offered the role of Josh Elton , in the new Indie film , " Burning Star " and one of my close friends , Brenda Song was also in the same situation where all she was offered were teen roles , so the casting producer of " Burning Star " , was really rooting that Brenda plays the female lead in the film .
