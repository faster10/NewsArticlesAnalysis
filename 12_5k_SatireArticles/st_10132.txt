When asked of the morality of a policy that might lead to the execution of innocent people , Dr vonKleist Smith retorted : " No man is innocent of hate speech . My own research has proven that men are genetically predisposed to hate speech . Just because a man has not yet uttered hate speech , does not mean he hasn ' t thought about it , or felt it in his heart . It is more important to excise the cancer of hate speech now than to worry about a few seemingly innocent men who get executed . You can ' t make an omlette withot breaking eggs . "
