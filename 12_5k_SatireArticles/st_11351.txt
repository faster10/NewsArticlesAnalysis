Animal slurries require special bio secure handling and are usually treated by containment in anaerobic lagoons , with the potential for causing severe pollution . Some animal slurries are treated by mixing with straw and then composted at high temperature to produce much more bacteriological sterile and friable manure for soil improvement . BMW research discovered that internal treatment of the cows with the new ultra soft synthetic rubber allowed for improved handling of large amounts of bovine excreta at the point where the waste is evacuated . The waste is now ready packaged for ethical disposal and goes some way to producing a more sterile manure using the beasts own internally generated heat .
