Congregants visiting the basilica have provided additional accounts of the emaciated former pontiff . A woman who was lighting a candle for a deceased relative said she saw a shivering Ratzinger attempting to warm himself by huddling close to votives in the Chapel of St . Helen last February . In addition , several altar boys have reportedly seen him in the sacristy devouring communion wafers by the boxful . And just this past Christmas , a group of nuns found him clinging beneath a pew during midnight Mass , after which he is said to have darted out the bronze doors and quickly scaled a travertine column to the basilica roof .
