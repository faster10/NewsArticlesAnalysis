Ladies and gentlemen , I don ' t have to say what a startling development this is . For years , I ' d been a believer in man made climate change , accepting what the scientists said about the cause of warming that it was due to human greenhouse gas emissions , but I suppose I should have known better . Those graphs were just too convenient . The science too rational , the theory just too logical , the data too perfect for it to be anything but a hoax .
