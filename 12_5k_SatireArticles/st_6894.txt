" I am proud to be a modern woman , " Asaad said . " I believe that women should be allowed to attend the university , so long as the school provides a separate area for women to sit in and they do not speak to the instructor before being spoken to . I even think it is acceptable for a young woman to ride a bicycle , provided she is out in the country where no man can view it . This is the 21st century , after all . "
