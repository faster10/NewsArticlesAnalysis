White House employees in the laundry room admitted that the cost of replacing the First Family underwear supply is so high because First Lady Michelle Obama refuses to wipe her ass . Laundry supervisor Elaine Hotchkiss said that " she thinks the Secret Service Agents or some white folks should do it for her . They say that it isn ' t their job and they refuse ( well , except for that Chris Matthews guy and he says he gets a thrill down his leg every time Mrs Obama lets him do it ) . Keith Olbermann also thinks that evey American has a duty to wipe her bottom , or else they are a racist , but he never does it himself . "
