So , my chil ' ren are both a blessin ' and one helluva calculated business move . As for Kevin , the divorce was also strictly business . It was nuthin ' personal . I just read somewhere where was it , Mama ? STAR Magazine ? that his album bombed , he looked like a loser , and that I ' d be one smart cookie to give him his walkin ' papers . Besides , he ' d already done the only decent work he ' ll ever do , which was knockin ' up America ' s Princess . Which is me . But y ' all know that already .
