And the problem is not confined to books . TV shows aimed at children have a corrupting influence too , according to child justice groups . Nigel Spiderman , who runs a youth project in London , said : " These programmes revel in glorifying these so called gangs . I watched one recently that showed a gang of pesky kids driving around in a pimped up vehicle they called the Mystery Machine , breaking into houses with their talking dog . Such programmes can only lead children directly to criminal activity so I welcome the Home Secretary ' s intervention . "
