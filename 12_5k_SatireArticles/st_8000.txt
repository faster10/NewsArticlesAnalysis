" I was the greatest alien police fighter in the fourth realm . That is before Pluto exploded and I was cast out into space . I was the only man who survived the explosion who could breath in space . And luckily for earth I was the only person from my planet who learned how to travel through time using my perplex muscle . A muscle inside my brain that only I knew existed . It was only a matter of time before I needed to change my name . The Mexican super cyber scientific secret base bad guys had already mastered time travel , and were hot on my tail . I knew that Constable Police Man was the only alias left that wouldn ' t draw attention . As I ' ve used every other possible combination of letters , in a large but finite world of parallel universes . "
