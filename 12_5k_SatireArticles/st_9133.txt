Jocelyn Wildestein aims to go to trial in November looking her best . She ' s already had another breast enhancement , to add to two previous operations and is currently doing her third nose remodeling plus the monthly Botox boost . " By the time I ' ve finished I will have removed every single line and wrinkle from my perfect face , darling " Jocelyn said in a light almost happy tone , although myself and the photographer could not tell from looking at her . She added in a more sterner tone " It ' s my face and they are my emotions . I can do whatever I please with them " Now she was getting real heated , although looking at her we still could not tell " And with this Court case I am gonna bury those little bastards for good . " She banged her fists down hard on the table . And almost pulled a slight grimace . But we ' re not really sure .
