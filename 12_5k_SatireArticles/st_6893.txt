" I wanted it to be eye catching , so I went to Bartz Party Supply and picked out some classy pictures from their clip art book , including a couple ballroom dancing , two hands clinking champagne glasses , and a top hat with white gloves and a cane , " Smalls said . " Now , that would ' ve worked just dandy for a wedding or New Year ' s Eve invitation but , as I found out the hard way , not for a pancake breakfast . Only eight people showed up , and some parishioners complained that they thought the breakfast was going to be a ritzy affair . They were too intimidated to attend . "
