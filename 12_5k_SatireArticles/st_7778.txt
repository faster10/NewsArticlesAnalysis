When asked to explain the knockwurst , a tearful Ms . Lawson stated " I didn ' t mean to break the law . It ' s just that I am somewhat of a sausage freak , and when I saw that this particular brand of knockwurst was being sold in America and not in the United Kingdom , as far as I am aware , something in me snapped . I knew I needed that particular knockwurst to make my famous German sausage , cabbage and potato stew . "
