The researchers hypothesize that we ' re adapting to an environment that contains more and more machines , which makes us more robotic in our thinking and behaviour . " Computers don ' t yet have much emotional capacity , " explains Dr Pishposh . " There ' s something about programming a computer with a lot of math and logic you don ' t get much intuition or feeling out of that machine . So assholization itself begins with the advent of technology . An ax is an asshole . Just try dropping one on your foot and you ' ll see what I mean . The ax won ' t get out of the way , let me tell you . And a car is a big , whopping asshole . Cars kill people all the time , the buggers . And computers , too assholes , the lot of them . They cost an arm and a leg , they always crash on you , and you think your porn is well hidden , but no it turns out you forgot to password protect one of the directories and then your wife finds it . I hate it when that happens .
