" Much adverse publicity has been made out of pictures of passengers laying around in terminals for hours waiting for delayed flights . Nearly all our flights are delayed for at least 2 hours , which is how long it will take the average passenger to walk from one end of the mall to the other . Therefore for the average passenger , the delay will appear to be zero . For longer delays passengers can treat their trip to the airport like a ' day out at the shops ' , so bring along your credit cards and extra cash ! " enthuses the statement .
