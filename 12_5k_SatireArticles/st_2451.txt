According to Milner , the beliefs of the Aesopians are simple and direct . " We honor the courage and the noble sacrifice of Aesop , who gave His life to educate the world , not backing down even to the day of His execution by the wicked Athenian despot Peisistratus , " Milner said . " That event , though tragic on the surface , was actually a day of exhilarating triumph over evil , for as a result of it , the histories painstakingly recorded by Aesop gained immortality . "
