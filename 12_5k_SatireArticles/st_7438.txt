Although their popularity was built on having squeaky clean fun whilst educating children , Jim revealed that his and Rosie ' s lifestyle was the polar opposite of their on screen personas . " We may have come across as f cking saps who spent all day sat on that f cking barge whilst some bloke drew some s it in the corner but our parties were out of control . The second those cameras went off we shared a bag of cocaine with the duck at the front of the barge . Then it became two bags , three bags , four bags , we were hooked . We needed it after recording to maintain the high before getting pissed on whisky ' s worth hundreds of pounds . We were untouchable in the 90 ' s , the producers knew they couldn ' t sack us . One of the directors quizzed Rosie one morning before the camera ' s started rolling as she had the shakes really bad . She just nutted him in the face , told him to f ck himself and put a lit cigar in his eye when he was on the ground . I can still hear his cries of pain right now during my prerecording pick me up toot of coke " .
