" As I was buying coffee in the quad one morning , Stan came by waving those roller skates he sometimes wears on his hands , " Lundergaard said . " I distinctly heard him say , ' I can ' t be in two places at once ! I can ' t meddle in my own affairs ! I can ' t destructively interfere with my own future plans ! What do I look like the uncollapsed wave function of an electron ? ' He was referring to the seemingly paradoxical aspects of wave particle duality as illustrated by the ' two slit ' experiment in electron diffraction . Stan wasn ' t just mouthing phrases : The crazy homeless man knows his stuff . "
