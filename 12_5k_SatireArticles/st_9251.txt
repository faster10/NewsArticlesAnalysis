My firm has valued " auditees , " not valued " clients . " I will be reminding my colleagues to be sure and add the term " auditees " to their spell check programs . After all , if they forget to do so , the word will be tagged as misspelled in their communications . Should they make the mistake of choosing the suggested change of " nudities " to replace " auditees , " they would be doing irreparable harm to the reputation for quality , excellence , and family values we hope to achieve in our firm ! We have nothing to hide . Wearing no clothes feels right to us , but we don ' t want to force our lifestyle on others . 2 . Print is " out " as a means of communicating financial information . Whenever possible , the auditors in my firm will use sign language . It ' s trendier and has the benefit of saving the trees I may need , should I decide to leave the jungle of the boardroom and return to my ' original ' jungle habitat .
