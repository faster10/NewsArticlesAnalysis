" There ' s a right way and a wrong way to do this film , " Beresford said . " One of the wrong ways would definitely be to make a big deal out of the truck . Don ' t get me wrong , this guy ' ll have a nice rig , like the three axle Ford Super Duty I drive at Central Montana . But I could see some Hollywood type putting him in a big 30 foot rollback tower with all these extra hydraulics and a crewcab and that kind of crap . That ' s not how it should be done . Towtruckin ' is all about the tow trucker , not the tow truck . "
