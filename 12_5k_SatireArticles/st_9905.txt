The restaurant ' s owner , Dan Gilding , recalls when he had the idea to open the business : " My wife and I were eating at a Dick ' s Last Resort in San Diego . The waiters are told to be rude there and we thought it was a lot of fun . We then thought , hey , the gay people where we ' re from in L . A . are twice as rude as these people without even trying . We should open one of these there . But we had no idea how cunty these gays could be if that type of behavior was encouraged . I , myself , was afraid to check in on the restaurant for fear of my outfit or hair style being mocked . No one was prepared for this level of verbal brutality . "
