Nintendo lays the blame on the over manufacturing of the Wii Systems , and too few game choices . Nintendo started production of the first 5 million Wii ' s back in November of 2005 , and continued with 1 million system every month since then , world wide . The company only sold 500 units in the U . S . alone , only 1 3rd of the projected sales for North America . With nearly 30 million units left on the shelves , stores have already started to auction the machines to Dollar store distributors .
