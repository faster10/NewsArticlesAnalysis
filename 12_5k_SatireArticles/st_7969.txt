The design of this new earth , or " Heofon " as it is presently being referred to by the PIETI team , is unique in nature . Blueprints on charts displayed behind the panel of technicians and project coordinators at the conference showed , not a spherical shape as one might expect , but a decidedly flat , thin shape . When questioned about the counterintuitive design , Jacobson responded " . . . well , there will be no need for a ' hell , ' of course , since the team is united in agreement that the existing hell below earth ' s crust , with all of its circles , has plenty of room . There is no proof to the contrary . So we feel assured in our design decision . Also , the bible teaches us that no one really goes to hell until judgment day . Besides all of that , Heofon will be inhabited by Christians exclusively . Need I explain further ? "
