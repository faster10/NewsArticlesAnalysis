North Haverbrook ' s Sacred Heart Hospital officials say they ' ve never seen anything like it , and intend to never see it again . Four doctors and two nurses have been immediately suspended and may face a season long suspension for their part in an ugly brawl that began when Dr Artest disagreed with Dr Jackson ' s diagnosis of a patient . What makes this particular hospital brawl stand out from other recent brawls is that this time the action spilled over to include not just patients , but even family members in the waiting room .
