" The woman ' s a tool , " Shuttlecock raged , as he cracked another can of Belgium ' s finest and sparked another roll up . " I could have told you that from day one . It isn ' t so much that she ' s out of touch she can ' t even see what it is that she ' s supposed to be touching . It ' s like watching a blind woman in a cake shop . I mean , we had riots last year , and she decided to cut the police numbers . The woman ' s a complete public school educated and I use the word ' educated ' lightly buffoon . These union people have very real concerns , and the best she can do is to try to shame them by labelling them as ' unpatriotic ' ? Why doesn ' t she just TALK to them ? Her and Boris Johnson would make an ideal couple . Two halfwits together . "
