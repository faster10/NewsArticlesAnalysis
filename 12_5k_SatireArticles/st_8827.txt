The Lawyer kills because he can and once he has landed his prey he simply tosses its cadaver to the rest of his kind to be devoured . Older lawyers are given the best cuts . If he is not hungry he is content to maim his prey for life and will let it go back into the undergrowth to suffer a lingering death , such is his cruelty . Every other creature in the jungle is at its mercy , especially media people and creative people who imagine they are safe and no harm can come to them .
