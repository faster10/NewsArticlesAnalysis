In reply to Mr Turnbull , the leader of the extra terrestrials said that the claims that they wanted to take over the country and the world " are despicable lies " . He said that just because they have very big families and belong to a militaristic religion that tells them that they are better than anyone else , are destined to kill off all unbelievers and rule the universe did not mean that they are bad people . " We are entitled to our religious beliefs just like anyone else . " he said , " Our religion tells us that it is good and holy to use terrorism against non believers , which is all we are doing . "
