It all kicked off when hours into the party , x factor reject and I ' m a celeb runner up Jake Quickenden , who stood flexing his muscles and is known to get rather gobby after a few drinks was watching journalist Michael Burke do some impressive back flips across the dance floor . Actress Vicki Michelle arrived and said ' oh my , is that Jimmy doing those flips ' . Bringing up the long running joke that caused controversy resulting in Jimmy ' s early exit , Jake shouted across to Jimmy ' Jim , Vicki still reckons you ' ve got a body like Michael ' s ' . Jimmy who surprisingly for a comedian can get rather touchy yelled ' eh what the f you sayin that again for you vain twat , ' and shoved Jake . Foggy who had heard the commotion ran over and shouted ' Jimmy ain ' t got a body like Micheal but he sure got a face like him ' .
