" Every time I go to the dentist and get a cleaning , I vow that I ' ll start taking better care of my teeth , " said Naasz , who brushes two times a day and flosses once or twice whenever he buys a new flossing product . " If I could just find something that would make fighting plaque and tartar less of a boring , repetitive chore like a really flavorful toothpaste or a cool electric toothbrush then I ' d want to do it .
