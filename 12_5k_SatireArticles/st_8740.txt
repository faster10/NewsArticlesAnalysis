Deborah Gibson , a consultant diabetologist at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital , described the MP ' s remarks as disgraceful . " It ' s an insult to people with type 1 diabetes and their families and it ' s an insult to people in Norfolk , " he said . " There ' s no suggestion that that is the case . It ' s not the way that the genetics work . There is a genetic element but it may be triggered by an environmental factor . Nobody knows why it is rising . "
