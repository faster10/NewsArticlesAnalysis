" I don ' t say this often , but visiting this little bar is actually worth extending your time between flights , " Meyers said . " It ' s never crowded , the chairs are incredibly comfortable , and it ' s set back a bit from the terminal walkways , so it ' s not nearly as loud as your average airport bar . I ' d have to put it up there with the Cheers bar at Detroit Metro and the one they used to have at the end of the United terminal at Denver ' s old Stapleton International . "
