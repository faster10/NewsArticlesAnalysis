" Boy , our agents picked that posting up in a heartbeat . Man if that is not a threatening terroristy type message I don ' t know what is " exclaimed Knucklehead . " We had some of our female agents befriend her and let her know that ' there is something that she can do about it ' . We set her up with a bomb in the basket of her bike and had her park it near the booth where her mom was and then detonate it . By her detonating it , we will be able to pile on the charges and hopefully get her the death penalty . She is definitely going to be tried as an adult . She knew exactly what she was doing " .
