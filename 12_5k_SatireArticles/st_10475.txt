Al Gore , who went out of his way to speak reporters , had this to say : " I think President Bush ought to stay away from Idaho . If he eats a potato , he might call it a carrot . C ' mon , guys , isn ' t that funny ? I hope you put that in the newspaper . I stayed up all night coming up with that great joke ! Please please please don ' t walk away ! I must continue to be in the spotlight ! "
