" Sony is pressuring Allen to make significant script changes , including a totally new ending , in which an old high school friend runs into Reuben and convinces him to move to his Jewish , upper middle class Denver suburb . Freed from the angst that dominates his Manhattan life , Reuben opens a bookstore coffee shop , which becomes very popular . Energized by his newfound success , he marries his attractive blonde assistant and overcomes his destructive obsessions with existentialism , art and early jazz , abandoning such longtime heroes as Freud and Marx for more positive , contemporary Jewish role models like Steven Spielberg and Calvin Klein .
