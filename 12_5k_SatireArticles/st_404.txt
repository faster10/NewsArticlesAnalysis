Standing at the excavation site , a 20 by 20 foot square pit along the Nile River , Hutchins noted key elements of the find . " The skeletons lived in this mud brick structure , which , based on what we know of these people , was probably haunted , " he said . " Although we found crude cooking utensils in the area , as well as evidence of crafts like pottery and weaving , we are inclined to believe that the skeletons ' chief activity was jumping out at nearby humans and scaring them . And though we know little of their language and means of communication , it is likely that they said ' boogedy boogedy ' a lot . "
