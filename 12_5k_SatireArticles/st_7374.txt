Ant and Dec , who reckoned this was the best wrap party they had ever been to , were seen nicking a man ' s Yamaha motorbike with Ant driving and Dec clinging on at the back . As the lights went full beam , the bikers shouted with their fists in the air ' WE ' RE GONNA GET YA JIMMY BULLARD YOU FLAMIN GALAH ' and they sped into the hotel scratching the marble flooring in reception . After destroying the hotel ' s remains , Ant and Dec were the ones who rode too fast into Jimmy , flying him up into the air like a doll where he went flying out the door and landed in the deep end of the pool outside .
