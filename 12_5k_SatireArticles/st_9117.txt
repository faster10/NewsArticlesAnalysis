" It ' s true , " one hacker admitted . " It ' s a pity that this has all come out really , because I was quite fond of me pork pie hat , but as a recognition device for hackers it ' s no longer viable . We aren ' t going to go away or anything , but we ' ll have to devise something new , and a little bit different . Like a tam o ' shanter , or a fedora . Or maybe even a kilt in Buchanan tartan . . . Hang on . . . I ' ve just got to make a call . . . "
