" When ' Crazy ' Leo Krafchek first disappeared , we just assumed he ' d gone off on a tri state killing spree or something , " said Fisk ' s long time friend , Chainsaw Chuck . " But when there weren ' t any nun killings in the news , we started to worry . Then Otis Glen Ankrim ' s trademark birthday slayings stopped , too . When they found Henry ' s body , we knew we ' d never see Otis or Leo again , either . "
