In addition to retooling the interior , the Air Force has also instituted new fees to stay competitive and cut costs . Passengers bringing extra luggage items on board , such as fishing gear or a Scottish terrier , will be subject to a fee of 25 . Nonalcoholic beer , the most popular beverage on Air Force One for most of the past decade , is no longer free , but sold at 3 a bottle . Customers , however , can now choose to pay 98 a year to skip the hassle of going through the security measures required on standard carriers .
