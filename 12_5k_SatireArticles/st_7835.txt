Travis Mustafa Jordan of Black Entertainment Television agreed : " White are trying to take away the cultural identity of our black youth again . This system will be The Man trying to put down the brothers and bring back slavery and Jim Crow laws . At BET , we want to show the importance of our heritage . We want our children to know where they came from and why they are important . We want them to respect and honor their culture and to embrace it into their daily lives . Our young , and all viewers , must come to understand why they will be the leaders of tomorrow . It is their destiny to run this country in the future and they must embrace that . A new network that promotes Whitey and tries to show and tell everyone that they are better than us is just wrong and prejudiced . This is a racist agenda . "
