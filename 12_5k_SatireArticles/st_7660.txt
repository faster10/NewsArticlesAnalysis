Daisy followed the rocket ' s smoke trail back towards home , but the coyote wasn ' t finished . " A few minutes later , I looked over towards the horizon and there was this coyote , stretching himself on a giant slingshot pointed right at me ! I couldn ' t believe it ! I thought , ' Surely this isn ' t the same coyote . He couldn ' t have survived that fall , and if he did , how did he get back up here so fast ? And how did he build that giant slingshot ? ' But it was him . I didn ' t even have to hide though , because he shot the slingshot right into himself ! "
