" Just a few weeks ago in Cedar Rapids , there were a number of reports of weird signs with the message Jindal 2016 ' appearing out of nowhere in the windows of houses , " said Marion County sheriff Jason Knight , who assured residents that the " Kasich object was harmless and would not affect them or their behavior in any way . " This sort of thing just happens from time to time in these parts . Folks will eventually reconcile themselves to the fact that we may never really understand it . After all , people barely even mention that night four years back when the phrase Cain 9 9 9 ' flickered onto everyone ' s TV screens out of nowhere . "
