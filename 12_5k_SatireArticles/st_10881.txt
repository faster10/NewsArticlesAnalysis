As moving as O ' Shea ' s words are , some say he may still be understating the problem . Psychiatrist Dr Paul Crimmons says the scars of police inquiry can linger for years in even the strongest of clergymen : " What ' s most important is to see this from the priests ' point of view . They are humble and devoted servants of God true innocents , perhaps the only innocents left in modern society I certainly can ' t think of any others . When the only world where they feel safe is suddenly shattered by accusations and police procedures , they are made to feel devalued , like mere objects egoless props whose only function is in some lurid , tawdry legal process . This is a devastating event for someone as vulnerable as a priest . That ' s just how bad this situation is . "
