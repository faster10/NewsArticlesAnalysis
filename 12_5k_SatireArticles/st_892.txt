" I eat a high protein meal one hour before working out and a mixed high protein and potassium rich carb meal one hour after the workout , " Tuttle told Schuitt . " Then I take a Creatine Monohydrate supplement if it ' s an arm day , or a 32 ounce Twin Lab Amino Fuel shake if I ' m doing legs . You probably don ' t have to worry about that , though , if you ' re just looking to lose weight . Still , a good antioxidant wouldn ' t hurt . "
