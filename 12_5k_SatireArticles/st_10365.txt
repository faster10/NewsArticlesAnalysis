Perhaps even more shocking than the breadth of corruptive knowledge within the state government apparatus is the abject failure of pundits to thus far name the scandal . Typically pugnacious AP punster Bill Roll had this to say : " This is just awful , we can ' t call it Obama gate , or Rahm gate or Rahmbo gate , because there was so many people in on it . We can ' t call it Illinois gate , because people expect scandals out of this state . The really obvious clich is finally too clich d . I know we ' ve had nipple gate , Paris gate , condo gate , tuna gate , and Senate ethics committee chairman lewdly soliciting young boys gate , but water gate , WATERGATE ? ? ? That ' s too far , its over , I truly think it ' s finally over " .
