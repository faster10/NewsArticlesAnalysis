" People have been buying each of the models to reserve themselves a car parking space , which is the intention , " said Williams . " Think of it as a sun lounger towel . The Audi is the top of the range inflatable car . It self inflates when it detects that the car above it has driven away , and deflates when it senses the owner ' s car approaching . The Ford is pretty good too , with it ' s remote control inflation and deflation . It ' s our most popular seller . The Fiat has to be let down manually and pumped up with any foot pump . We ' ve sold a fair few of these to the cost conscious . "
