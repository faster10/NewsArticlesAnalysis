Club owner " Smoking Salvador Matrapoli , is not surprised by this outcome . " I run a perfectly legitimate business here , " Matrapoli said , brushing cigar ash from his white suit . " Firefighting is as much of our culture as bullfighting or kickboxing . All I do is provide quality entertainment and take a few bets . As for the safety of the fights themselves , many athletes in other sports have to face being incinerated or extinguished . The danger is what makes it exciting . "
