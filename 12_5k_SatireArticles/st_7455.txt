A third clause is that all the original characters from the first film must be dredged up and prettified for a reappearance no matter what condition the last 30 odd years had left them in . Leia , Luke , Solo , Chewbacca ( he should have bald spots by now ) and the two droids are all in the show . You would think the two robots would be rusted tight like the Tin Man was when Dorothy found him in the beginning of the Wizard of Oz movie . Leia had to get off the booze and Solo had to get off Calista Flockman .
