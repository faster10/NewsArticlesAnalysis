A summary on Domino ' s website elaborates on their new corporate philosophy , reading : " Pizza is merely a collection of matter , much like us all . It is made up of atoms , as is your door , as is our driver , as is the car which may or may not bring your hot , mouth watering Domino ' s pizza pie directly to your home . The universe is a meaningless maelstrom of happenstance and chaos . Nothing is fated nor inevitable , not your children , not the inferno of the sun , and not the delivery of our delectable cheesy bread . "
