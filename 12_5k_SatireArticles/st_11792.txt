Despite some logistical challenges , GOT ' s writers are working on integrating contemporary brands into the show ' s medieval setting . " Product placement isn ' t something we want viewers to notice or detract from their enjoyment of the show in any way , " said showrunner David Benioff . " So we ' ve tried to incorporate products in ways that help build the world of the story and make sense in the context of the scene . For instance , when Daenerys and her counselors are gathering for a meeting before they sack a desert city , how are they going to make their coffee ? They ' d probably use small disposable pods that are lightweight and require little preparation , and Keurig coffee pods are all of those things so yeah , this kind of writes itself . "
