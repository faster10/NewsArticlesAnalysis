When asked if the idea for a name change was because the team was on the edge of the bible belt and did not want to be assosciated with the devil , Balk said that " the Satanic idea has nothing to do with it . We actually tried selling our souls to the devil for a World Series victory early in the season . He laughed and said that he did that once for our football team , and didn ' t really care much for our city . "
