If you don ' t have the money to purchase a firearm , how about getting a box of ammunition ? If you can ' t use it , give it to a friend as an early Christmas gift better yet , give it to a family member or friend as a " Protect and Defend the Constitution " gift . If that is beyond your budget or means , you can always buy some targets they run pretty cheap . Even a box of bb ' s sends a message .
