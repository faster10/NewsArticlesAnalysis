Landlady Lucy Timms takes up the story , " It was the usual Monday night , quiz going on and regulars in the main bar getting quietly pissed . All of a sudden I heard an almighty thud , raised voices and glasses smashing . I ran round to the snug and there was Eamon pouring his drink over the quizmaster and going berserk ! ' Eamon ! keep your hair on ' I told him . Which wasn ' t much use as he ' s going full on slaphead . So I chucked him out and barred him . "
