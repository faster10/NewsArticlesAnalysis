The next 15 minutes or so were about the wireless alarm ' s features , the fact that they just happened to have a free installer at my zip code the next day , and there wasn ' t an obligation until the alarm was fully installed in the home , when the need to sign a 5 year contract with Alliance Home Protection for 47 . 50 plus tax per month would be required plus a pre payment either by credit card or check . Funny , they never said anything about that free sign in my yard !
