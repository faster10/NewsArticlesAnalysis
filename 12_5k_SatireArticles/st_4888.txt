" This Saturday will mark my sixth arrest , or possibly seventh . I can ' t tell the future , " Jones said , shaking his head in apparent anger . " Yet I won ' t get charged this time , either . They ' ll just be persecuting me for the stabbing that ' s going to happen because of the other stuff that already happened . Is that fair ? I don ' t think that when Mr Smart Mouth Darrent Wilson gets stabbed it should affect my career like that . "
