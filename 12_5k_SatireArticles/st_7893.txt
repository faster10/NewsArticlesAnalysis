" It ' s a stupid diet , " Doctor Eddie Wareing of Halifax University told reporters . " People just don ' t lose weight by living on pies , pizzas , fish and chips , kebabs and burgers with cheese and fries . They just get fatter . Even moreso if they don ' t exercise like the clappers . Steak and kidney pies in shortcrust pastry have so many calories that they have been known to cause people ' s intestines to explode . Especially when combined with chips . There ' s no merit whatsoever in this nonsensical piece of dietetic buffoonery . It ' s just bloody stupid if you ask me . "
