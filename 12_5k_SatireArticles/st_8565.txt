" The end of rounds are all the same as darts , like ' Game Shot , and the first set , Tim Henman to serve first ' , just an example . Another great thing about it being in the pub is that we can have instant replays with the CCTV . It ' s far better than Wimbledon , I feel , and you can have a pint of bitter and a packet of pork scratchings while your at it , marvellous ! Not only that but swearing at the umpires is compulsary . Incidentally , Greg Rusedski is seeded number 1 in the Pub Tennis rankings . "
