Feb . 23 : The new cave is not what I had hoped for . When the rental agent said it was " one up " he neglected to mention it was 500 feet up the side of a cliff . Or that the running water he referred to was running in the river at the bottom of the cliff . Hassim is hanging curtains . There are no windows in the cave but I humor him . He has not been the same since he fell off the camel last month . Akmed claims it was due to his ( Hassim ' s ) landing on the seat of his burnoose .
