Thursday started off pretty damn shitty for New York City ' s Danny Suds . When he got to work at his job as a stock broker at U . B . Sucker he was told he was being fired for not once screwing any customer over in the five years he had been with the firm . Things got even worse when he returned home to find an empty apartment and a note from his wife telling him she had left him for that really weird guy that hangs out in the lobby all day dressed in a bunny suit . She had sold off everything they owned so the two of them could buy a giant live in Easter Basket .
