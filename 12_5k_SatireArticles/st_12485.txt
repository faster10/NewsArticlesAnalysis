On the night before Valentine ' s Day , I would address my cards . I would do them only to the girls in the room ( and never to the boys ) . My mother would invariably get mad because I should have used all of the cards and I still had half left . I would explain that I didn ' t think it was right to give Valentines to other boys , but she would throw one of those Mom style hissfits ( the one where they use your full name and threaten to tell your father ) . It didn ' t matter that it was a queer thing for me to do I ' d end up having to do them anyway . ( Political correctness over morality , even back in those days )
