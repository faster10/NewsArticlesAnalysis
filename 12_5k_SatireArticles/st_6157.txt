" The last few years have seen so many exciting advances in high tech health care for pets , " said Hentrich , also chief of cardiology at UCLA ' s Veterinary Hospital . " For example , at UCLA , we ' ve developed a balloon angioplasty technique that can open a cat ' s deformed cardiac valves . A catheter is passed into the deformed valve , then a balloon is inflated , allowing blood to pass more freely . This painless , revolutionary procedure has already been used to save the lives of thousands of beautiful , lovable cats . "
