' It has also been brought to my attention that many of the well meaning naked passengers on their flights this week had clothes in suitcases . That must stop . Unfortunately a suicide terrorist could easily board a flight naked and yet still have a pair of explosive nanosocks in their luggage . From next Monday it will be compulsory for all air passengers to fly naked , and in addition it will no longer be permitted for any flights entering or flying through American airspace to be carrying any luggage . There will instead be rails of cheap second hand clothes available for passengers to select and wear after arriving at their destinations . Or , if they prefer they can of course , like me , choose from now on to remain naked 24 7 . "
