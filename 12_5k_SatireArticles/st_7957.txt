Tom Johnson , a truck driver from Smelling , WI , was given a particularly rough quota from his boss last week . He was supposed to pick up a load in Augusta , Maine , and deliver it to San Francisco . Once in San Francisco , he was supposed to take another load and drop it off in Atlanta , GA . Despite the fact that this is an 83 hour drive non stop , and without hitting traffic , Johnson was supposed to be able to make the trip in 80 hours , when he had another assignment .
