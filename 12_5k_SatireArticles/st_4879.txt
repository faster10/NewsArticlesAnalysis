" I used to worry that the spark had left our marriage , but ever since we started having sex according to a rigid , preset schedule that we map out weeks in advance , we haven ' t been able to keep our hands off each other , " said Sarah , 37 , adding that carefully charting the narrow window in which her cervix is most receptive to her husband ' s sperm never fails to drive both of them wild with desire . " Now that we feel an earnest obligation to make love as often as possible during that monthly 72 hour window in which it ' s most feasible for me to conceive , we ' ve been going at it like a couple of frisky teenagers . I swear , sometimes we have silent , mechanical sex three , even four times a day now . "
