MARIETTA , GA The golf course at James J . Berner Park in this suburb of Atlanta is a little less shabby today , as city workers replace the worn out putting greens on the back nine . The new greens , which will provide golfers with a smoother , more reliable putting surface , are the first upgrade for the Berner Park golf course since 1994 and the first for the park overall since the tennis courts were repaved in 1996 . The renovation is part of a new , much needed federal aid project to help keep suburban parks afloat . But here in Marietta , as in so many other inner suburbs across the nation , it is a case of " too little , too late . "
