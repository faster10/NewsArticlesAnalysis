When asked about the relationship , Sven ' s reaction was passionate : " I ' m so in love with Laura , she ' s the most wonderful person in the world . I don ' t understand why everyone is slagging her off . Her love making is out of this world . She does this little thing where she bends backwards over a wheely bin . . . . . . . oh dear I ' ve said too much . You guys are so tricky , you ' ll always get me to spill the beans . "
