In announcing his resignation , the outgoing attorney general did acknowledge a new provision of the soon to be enacted Patriot Act II . The law , designed to protect all Americans against the sinister forces of terrorism running rampant in our streets , will require all homosexuals to wear a large pink triangle on their clothes . Women ' s fashions will also be affected by a provision inserted into the law by a newly elected Colorado congressman . The provision will require those who have ever practiced birth control ( which has been declared illegal in the U . S . Homeland ) to display a large scarlet letter " A " on their clothes at all times .
