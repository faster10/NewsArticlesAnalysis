The infirmary building stood by itself as if forced to be away from the other buildings that housed life and a slim glimmer of hope . Completed in 1872 , the brick building was dark and grimy from years of coal soot and mold . On one side thick vines crawled up to the second story windows that , at this hour , were still dark and appeared without life behind the grime streaked glass . In the rear of the building was a later addition , from appearances , it looked like it was added on in the 1920s . It housed the morgue and refrigerated storage rooms . The covered loading dock was large enough it could accommodate two trucks , and at present was deserted . The three steps leading up to the front doors were stained and worn white marble and matched the buildings doorway facade . Altoids turned the brass knob and let herself in . The deserted waiting area had about a dozen dark oak chairs , a small table covered with old magazines , a book on cross word puzzles and a few discarded paper cups . Antiseptic hung in the air , mixed with dust , and the smell of long stored paper . A partition made of aged , dark , oak and frosted glass housed the reception area and the double frosted glass doors that lead to the physician ' s area . She could see a light was on the other side and opened the door .
