Bernard E . Willsson , Assistant Associate Vice Vice Manager , discussed the usefulness of combining health exams with airport line holding . " Our thought was that queueing after a bomb threat would produce high anxiety and thoughts of one ' s own mortality . It was apparent to us that ordinary screenings would not allay that fear well enough . After all , screening for cholesterol and taking blood pressures are stiflingly boring . Fear of crashing mid Atlantic in a fiery blaze could only be countered effectively with ANOTHER , equally strong fear . Since most people dislike , not to say fear , intrusive medical exams , they are a perfect complement , rather , counterbalance in this instance "
