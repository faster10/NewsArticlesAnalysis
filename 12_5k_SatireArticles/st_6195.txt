Continued Blaine : " I can always tell when something ' s wrong with the U . S . populace when they come into my shop . Their posture ' s drooping , or they avert their eyes , or they tell me they love my new turquoise polka dotted shoes . Oh , boy ! That ' s when I know something ' s wrong . So I roll up my sleeves , brew up a big pot of java , haul the cheesecake out of the fridge , and say , ' Okay , American people , this is Garrett you ' re talking to here . What ' s eating you ? And don ' t say ' a Brazilian cabana boy , ' because I won ' t believe you . "
