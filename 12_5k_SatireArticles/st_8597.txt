" Before the race starts , the big question is not whether anyone is bad enough to lose to Guftuson , but whether he has the will to lose for a tenth time . " It ' s hard . Sometimes I think , ' hey , I can pass that guy . I can beat his time , ' " he said . " But then I remember I ' m not just doing this for me , I ' m doing it for America . "
