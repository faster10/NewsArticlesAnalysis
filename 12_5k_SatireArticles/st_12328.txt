Now that we have those facts straight , in our opinion , it is too easy to conclude that the problem is guns and that the solution to the problem is more and stricter gun control laws . For politicians , it is politically expedient to take that position and pass more gun control laws and then claim to constituents that they have done the right thing in the interest of protecting our children . Who can argue with that ? Of course we all want to find a solution . But , is the problem really guns ? Would increasing gun regulation solve the problem ? Did we outlaw cars to combat drunk driving ?
