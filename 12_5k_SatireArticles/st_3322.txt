" Krystal , we are deeply saddened for you and your family , " a condolence card from the Seattle Storm team read in part . " But you can take comfort knowing that you are not alone . Last year we won the WNBA championship trophy , so we have some sense of the empty sensation you must be feeling right now , a feeling as if the entire universe has made a mockery of you . If you want to talk about it , just know we are here for you . And that we ' re very , very sorry . "
