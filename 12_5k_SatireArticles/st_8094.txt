Professor Mike Wibs and his team are credited with breaking the news . Professor Wibs said " Over many years each walker has been responsible for a downward shift of the underlying rock structure of 0 . 003mm every time they step on the mountain . With sheer weight of numbers it is easy to see how this adds up . The problem is the loose shale that is easily moved . The unfortunate thing now is that it is likely heavy people will have to pass a " fit for purpose " test before they can tackle the mountain " The news will dismay countless walkers , not least those who are stout , but will not come as a surprise to many who have stood at the summit of Scafell Pike and gazed across to Scafell wondering if it was higher . The commonly held belief was that this is due to an optical illusion or mountaineering sickness similar to the bends . However we now know different .
