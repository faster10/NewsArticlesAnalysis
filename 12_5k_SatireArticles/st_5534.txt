They asked me to leave , but they were very nice about it . I take that as a sign from above a sign of encouragement . I ' ll keep trying . Journalists like persistence . It shows I ' m serious . In fact I ' ll keep circling around their booth , step in and out and wave to them occasionally . That will keep me on their mind . Maybe I ' ll bring them some coffee , give them some compliments on today ' s edition maybe even some pointers on how they could improve the USA Today . It ' s not everyone who would take the time to thoughtfully share some free advice .
