" I had competing offers from both Dairy Freez and Lube In 10 , but neither of those companies makes the list of top grossing Massachusetts businesses , much less the Fortune 500 , " Novato said .

But in the final analysis , I felt it was in my long term best interest to go with a global leader . "
