In her native Massachusetts , Mrs Voortface is something of an icon . " Oh , Biddy , " reported Mayor Jerome Westbrook , " she ' s a fixture in our community . Yup . Back in the 70 ' s she sued the MBTA for all the rumbling on the Purple Line . Rumble , rumble , rumble , all day long . In ' 88 she led the protest against Donelans Supermarkets to prevent the sale of Rice Crispies for obvious reasons . Just last week she filed a grievance in my office against the Whistle Stop Caf across the street , well , you know , because of the name I can ' t say people love her , but she keeps them entertained . Y ' ever notice that there ' s not a bumble bee or hummingbird within twelve miles of Lincoln ? That ' s no coincidence . "
