If you skip the fancy meal altogether , it ' s as though the holiday ( and your family ! ) never happened . Try things other than sitting down for a meal go for a jog , practice your clarinet , see Gone Girl ( Haha we ' re kidding , see anything but Gone Girl ) . If you ' re feeling extra ambitious , take a moment to share your Nothing with your friends and neighbours : an empty roasting pan or soup tourine on their doorstep will always get your gesture across .
