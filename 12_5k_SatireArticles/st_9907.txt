One server , named Stefen , accounted for almost half of the psychological fallout from the restaurant ' s brief stint . Manager , Dustin Jones , remembers interviewing Stefen : " I wasn ' t going to give him the job because he had little experience and was fired from every job he ever had . But when I walked away he picked up his cell phone and began talking about me behind my back . His words were damaging and deeply penetrating . He was the rudest person I had ever met , so it felt appropriate to give him the job . When I told him the effect of his words he replied that damage and deep penetration were his specialties . I tried to have minimal contact with Stefen after that . "
