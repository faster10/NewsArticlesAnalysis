" I always made sure to save every cent I could and live cheap . I own about three hundred pounds of gold and I have no idea how much silver right now , " Nelson admits . " As well as a couple gyms , four diners in North and South Carolina , land in North Carolina . I have a diverse stock portfolio , and plenty of money in savings accounts . Best of all , I own the biggest greenhouse and gardening centre in North Carolina , or at least in the western half , and I can always just go work there . Nothing would be more wonderful than getting paid to create beauty , to grow plants and teach others how to grow plants . " He laughs . " I bet you ' d never have expected that out of Nelson ' s mouth ! Oh , and for the record , I am heterosexual , and there are at least a dozen women who work somehow in making the Simpsons show who can confirm that . "
