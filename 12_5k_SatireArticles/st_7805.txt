Adam quickly became good at musicals , starring as Dolly in Hello , Dolly ! and as Wendy in Peter Pan . He also enjoyed a successful winter season in the UK , playing Widow Twankey in pantomime at Scarborough to Dale Winton ' s towering Aladdin . Adam learned so much from Dale Winton , and really benefitted from playing underneath Dale , who equally enjoyed towering over Adam . The irrepressible pair became known to the rest of the cast as Hinge and Bracket , and exchanged addresses , phone numbers , and so much more .
