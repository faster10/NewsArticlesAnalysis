ALF . The ultimate illegal alien , ALF comes from outer space , but talks like he ' s from Brooklyn . He has been in and out of the public spotlight ( mostly out ) since his TV series was canceled decades ago . Would be a magnet for the Hispanic vote , but doesn ' t have Bloomberg ' s gift for speaking another language . Triumph " the insult comic dog . " Bloomberg has been criticized for not cracking down on the organized crime mob known as Wall Street , mainly by people who don ' t realize he draws his power from the organized crime mob known as Wall Street . Triumph could change all that by directing his insult comedy at Wall Street ' s fiscal gangsters to provide the perception that justice is being served . ( That ' s a funny line , " justice is being served . " )
