Young Stevie ' s ordeal began two weeks ago , when his parents , Duane and Francine Burke , lost control of their vehicle while driving their son to daycare . According to police investigators who later reconstructed the accident , the Burkes swerved wildly when a fuel truck failed to negotiate a tight curve , jackknifing into their lane and hitting the Burkes ' Honda Civic . The Burkes ' car , it is believed , drove off the highway after sliding under the truck ' s chassis , rupturing the tanker as sparks from the collision ignited the spilling fuel . Engulfed in flames , the twisted wreckage of both vehicles plunged down a steep embankment , rolling several times and coming to a stop moments before exploding .
