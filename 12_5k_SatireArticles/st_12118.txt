Just to show how stupid this administration is , not only by having Joe ' Brainiac ' Biden as their pitch man , but by not allowing the Senate Democrats to NOT refuse to vote for the President ' s jobs bill . Many Senate Democrats are openly stating that they will not support the bill . Afterall , the bill wasn ' t ever intended to be passed , it was , and is , just ' voter bait ' for the Republicans to nibble on and say NO to ! Then to take the blame when it didn ' t pass . Not the President ' s party the Democrats !
