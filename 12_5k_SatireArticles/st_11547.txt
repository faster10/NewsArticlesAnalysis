" We ' ll have no overhead except for the office in my home in Malibu , which incidentally is next to Al Gore , and for which I ' ll be paying myself rent . We ' ve got lots of unpaid stringers waiting to sign on including bored housewives , teachers with a lot of free time on their hands during the day , and we ' re even starting to hear from thousands of ' non essential ' government workers anticipating to be furloughed due to the impending shutdown of the federal government . And even better , I ' ll have no no healthcare premiums to worry about , even though Barry said he ' s give me a waiver if I needed it ! "
