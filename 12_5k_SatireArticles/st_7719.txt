" Directional Affair . " In this sort of affair , a woman looks for a man who can find his way from point A to point B without forcing her to roll down the window and ask for assistance from random passers by who have just moved to the United States from a foreign country or alien planet . She has perfunctory sex with him first , and then they drive around various states in a nondescript rented car while wearing sunglasses and those tourist type L . L . Bean hats . The directional driving , not the sex , is the truly satisfying part .
