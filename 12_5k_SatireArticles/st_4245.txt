Those in attendance , many of whom had trekked hundreds or even thousands of miles , spoke of the great sacrifices they had made solely so that they could look upon an actual Christmas tree with their own eyes . A number of the Christians recounted how they had secretly carried a brightly painted plastic nativity scene and an inflatable 7 foot tall snowman to the secret site , the latter item having been trafficked across three states in a truck with a false bottom . Others mentioned how they had sewed a few star and wreath shaped sugar cookies into the linings of their coats to avoid detection by the masses who sought to erase their holiday and ultimately , their entire faith from American life .
