Pressed to explain what life is like in his time , Wolcott described a fantastical world in which grocers ' freezers are stocked exclusively with Dippin ' Dots , birthdays are celebrated with hot fudge Dippin ' Dots sundaes , and , in the summertime , children run excitedly through the streets following the familiar jingle of a Dippin ' Dots truck . The Dippin ' Dots man then distributes cups of Dippin ' Dots to the children , who rejoice heartily . Dippin ' Dots , the future man said , are a world famous treat and a staple of Americana .
