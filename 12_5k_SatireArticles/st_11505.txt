" In my country only the intellectuals get a say . The intellectuals are decided by me , the most intellectual of them all . I got a 2400 2400 on my SAT and a 1st from 5 different North Korean universities without even attending there . It ' s only right that the intellectuals get to rule a country . Why should non economist decide the economical policy of a country ? Do you want a repeat of Zimbabwe where my dear friend Mugabe pleaded with his people that printing more money wasn ' t the solution ? He reiterated constantly that it wasn ' t as simple as that but them being non intellectuals decided against his advice , look at their state of affairs now . "
