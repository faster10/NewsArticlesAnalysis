Creel says Satan doesn ' t look at all like what you think of , if you think of Him as a red guy with a little beard and horns . Instead , he looks a lot like Creel himself . " Looked just like me , " said Creel . " Not that I ' m the Satan or anything like that , but that I think He must reflect you back or channel your image or something . And that ' s what makes it so scary . "
