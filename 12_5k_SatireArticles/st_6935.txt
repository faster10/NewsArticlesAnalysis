Seriously , if you don ' t put the right things into your body , you ' re not going to get the maximum benefit from all that sweat . I usually eat a chicken sandwich without the bun about two hours before a workout and then maybe a can of tuna mixed with vegetables 20 minutes after I ' m done . To build muscle , you need protein lots of it . "
