" Onlookers reported Ronaldo looking like a little school boy , as he sat down on his bum and crossed his legs . Fergie approached him , sliding his arm slowly into his small bag , Ronaldo kept his eyes routed to the floor . " I ' ve brought ' a little somethin ' for ya " said Fergie softly . Ronaldo lifted his head and widened his eyes " Boss , you brought me the hairdryer ! "
