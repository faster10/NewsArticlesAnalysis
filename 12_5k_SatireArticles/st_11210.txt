A landfill holding medical waste , including the corpses of dead rats and mice used in scientific experiments at hospitals and medical testing facilities from all over the world , is another key cog in the economic solvency of the little hamlet . Also deposited are the scatterings of monkey , rat , and mouse bowel movements . This fecal matter is collected from lab chimps , along with medical rats and mice on a worldwide level . Every primate and rodent that has suffered immensely through medical researching experiments and has taken a crap over the course of the last 15 years is very well represented here . Most of the experiments deal with testing for AIDS , HIV , various types of cancer , smallpox , Ebola , Creutzfeldt Jakob disease ( or Mad Cow Disease caught by human beings ) , and the bubonic plague . The foul smelling material dumped is so noxious and hazardous that workers dress like astronauts just to be safe from being poisoned by this biological train wreck of refuse . But the pay isn ' t bad . Workers start at 95 an hour and there is a 10 increase to any employee who lives and lasts more than three months . This landfill is humongous , the size of three contiguous 18 hole golf courses laid side to side .
