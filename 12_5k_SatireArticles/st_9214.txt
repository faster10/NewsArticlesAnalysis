President Obama has asked Congress for legislation to establish the Population Moving System Administration ( PMSA ) , with a sizable budget . The president made the case to a skeptical Congress that millions of new jobs would be created , new skills learned and ObamaCare would cover every American anywhere . The real estate housing markets would boom moving companies would prosper interstate commerce would increase trains , buses and airline ticket sales would flourish automobile sales would skyrocket and no American would ever do home improvement projects themselves again , but hire a contractor .
