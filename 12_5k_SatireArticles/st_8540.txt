Third InningContinuing on the " angry fan " theme , elderly patrons at a Florida Marlins game attending " Hearing Aid Battery Night " became so enraged during a musical break between innings that they began hurling thousands of the free hearing aid batteries onto the field . Apparently upset at the incredibly loud and poor quality music of Britney Spears , the seniors also tossed several colostomy bags from the upper decks , nearly hitting attending Governor Jeb Bush who slipped and fell amongst their discarded contents . Cheers erupted , although the Governor later had the offending elderlies euthanasized . Fourth InningIn an unsurprising move , the US Olympic Committee has unilaterally and in advance awarded all of the medals for the 2004 Olympics to US athletes . USOC Chairman Peter Ueberroth explained the move by saying " And whatcha gonna do about it ? "
