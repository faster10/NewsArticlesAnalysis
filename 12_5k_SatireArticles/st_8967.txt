Illness use among the young population of Britain is growing rapidly . It is estimated that " clubbers " aged 18 25 are most at risk , especially from evil dealers in AIDS .

One test is to nick the skin of a suspect , and if they bleed like a human , they ' re clear if the bleed like a horse , then they ' re taken in to the station for charging .
