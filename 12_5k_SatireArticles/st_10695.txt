" I am confident that if the hopes and prayers of all Americans and people around the world are with us , my team and I will be able to lay an overly elaborate trap for the Oil Ugly . After some hi jinks , possibly Mr Shatner and myself dressing up as nineteenth century barbers , and stalling the ghost by pretending to offer him a haircut and shave , the Oil Ugly will be ensnared in our trap . After removal of a rubber mask , we hope he will be revealed to be a completely mortal human , with petty personal interests for faking the haunting rather than ones of international intrigue . Likely he will be the aforementioned Old Man Dithers or possibly third party Presidential spoiler candidate Ralph Nader . Once his supernatural exploits have been explained away as an old Vaudeville performer ' s parlor tricks to the satisfaction of a kindly local sheriff , and the culprit admonishes us as meddlers , I fully believe America can and will move forward to a new era of unprecedented progress and well being , as affairs of state return to normal " , Obama finished .
