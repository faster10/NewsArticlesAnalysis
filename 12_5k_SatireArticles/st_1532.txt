" People are always yelling and yelling here , so I drew this secret room that ' s hidden above the House gallery that ' s full of pillows and stuffed animals and things like that , " said Rep . Kurt Schrader ( D OR ) , who later had to be separated from Rep . Jimmy Duncan ( R TN ) after Duncan called Schrader ' s Capitol drawing " so dumb . " " No one knows about it but me . You get in through this little door here , and nobody can bother you for stuff they want you to do just ' cause they gave you a bunch of money for your campaign . "
