When I returned and drank a bit of my coffee , I began to feel a bit woozy , as if to be dozing off to sleep . When I finally came to , in a very luxurious hotel suite , I found myself stripped naked and prone face down on a bed which , for some strange reason , had a full length mirror hanging above it . "
