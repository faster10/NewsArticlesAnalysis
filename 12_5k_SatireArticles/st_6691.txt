" We ' re going to have superior production values , inspiring music , and live , prime time coverage straight from Baghdad , " said the State Department ' s media coordinator , Ellen Grainer . " Hussein ' s body has decomposed so much that his remains will have to be wrapped in canvas and covered up , but we plan to display a full color oversized photo of him directly behind the gallows . That should have a real impact on viewers . We ' re pulling out all the stops to make sure we get the feel good media moment everyone ' s looking for . "
