" I mean the Falcons and Niners are teams that would pride themselves on being worse than us and we can ' t have that . Cincinnati is scary too , those guys might try to tackle us and run into their own guys on accident . . and Chad Johnson might be too busy bitching at their coach , that screams trap game . "
