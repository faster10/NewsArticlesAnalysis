" My fellow Americans , I stand before you today to tell you that Diane has been riding my ass ever since my re election , " Clinton said . " Further , let us not forget that I was not even hired by Diane . I was hired by Rick , long before Diane even transferred here from the Odana Road office . In fact , I practically have seniority on that bitch . To get elected to the highest office in the United States by this nation ' s people and then be treated this way is unfair . It is what I would call ' bullshit , ' is what it is . "
