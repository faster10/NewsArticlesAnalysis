Mayor Tetchy continued , " We used to have a local fella who ' d come in every Friday causing trouble on the blackjack table . I said to him , ' Just because your name is Jack and you happen to be black it doesn ' t mean you automatically win . That ' s not how the game works mate . ' He never listened . Every week the same thing . I barred him eventually and he accused me of racism as a result . I told him , ' It ' s not because you ' re black , Jack . It ' s because you ' re an idiot . ' Never seen him since . "
