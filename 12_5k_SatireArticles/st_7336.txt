The categories for which Oscar is awarded change periodically , but , currently , actors can win an Oscar for either Best Actor in a Leading Role or Best Actor in a Supporting Role , and actresses can take Oscar home with them for winning Best Actress in the same roles . Others in the film business also have a chance to make Oscar their own , as the award is given for such categories , among others , as film , design , makeup and hairstyling , production , screenplay .
