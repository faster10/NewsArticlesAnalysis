" Don ' t get me wrong , I love them ladies , " says a bank teller , Dirk Simmons . " But sometimes I wonder if it ' s too much to ask not to have to start thinking like a monkey whenever I see a foxy chick at work . She ' s bending over the desk in this tight skirt and her phat butt ' s as round as the full moon , man I mean , it ' s like having the moon itself fall towards our planet just to smash you in the face . And I ' m like , " Gaddayum ! ' you know ? "
