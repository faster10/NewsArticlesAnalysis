The ' ' Iraq Study Group , ' ' was created by Mr Baker last March with the encouragement of some members of Congress to come up with new ideas on Iraq strategy . His comments offered the first glimmer of what other members of his study group , in interviews over the past two weeks , have described as an effort to find a way for Mr Bush slowly to extract the United States from what some have called a civil war . ' ' I think it ' s fair to say our commission believes that there are alternatives between the stated alternatives , the ones that are out there in the political debate , of ' stay the course ' and ' cut and run , ' ' ' Mr Baker said .
