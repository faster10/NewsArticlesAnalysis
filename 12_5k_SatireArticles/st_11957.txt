My friends , am I ever glad I listened to him . Jules , I don ' t know what you are up to these days , but if you ever need a job , you can come back and work with me at the plant I ' ll be a supervisor starting this winter . I ' m sorry again that I kissed your girlfriend the one time on high school prom night . And a couple of times more during the summer . And the night of commencement as well , but I never told you about that time .
