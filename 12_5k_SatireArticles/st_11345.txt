The treatment is a two part process similar to powder coating , where the helmet visor has to undergo a specialist cleaning treatment and surface preparation before the ultra soft synthetic rubber can then be applied . The visor is then placed in a centrifuge driven auto clave to heat treat the rubber to cure and remove any minor surface imperfections . The process is best done on a brand new visor . However , visors ( without any previous anti fogging treatment ) can be retro treated and a side benefit of the process is that it will eliminate any light surface scratches .
