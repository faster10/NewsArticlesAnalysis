Directed back to the link between the Bustards and the implications of this particular Act , Mukharjoy had this to say : " You know it ' s difficult to get a new bill passed in Parliament . . . the A C is very good and people are always getting up to go to the loo . So our beloved sub Leader Mr ah , forget the name of that chop ( sic ) too anyways , that sick man some problem with the spine , I am told he has this bright idea . He has these things once in a decade , fifteen years . . . well , anyway , he suggested that rather than waste time writing new laws , we just add to old laws . Anyways , it ' s common knowledge that our beloved Rajkumarji invented the Internet when he was working his dual PhD in Brazil , or Colombia . . . or somewhere . "
