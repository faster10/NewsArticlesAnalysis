The letter goes as follows , " This is the Zeta Cartel speaking , up to this moment we have killed 21 people from listeria contamination . We paid a worker at the Jensen Farms in Granada , Colorado to put listeria spores on the equipment in the farms packing facility . We have grown rather angry with the police for their efforts to stop our drug shipments , so we have changed the way we deal with our problems . We shall no longer kill people on an individual basis . When we commit murder it will be by the hundreds , by the thousands and eventually by the millions . Our killing tools have become sophisticated and beyond your reality . The death machine is already made . It ' s not difficult for you to save people , just leave the Zeta Cartel alone and stay out of our drug operations .
