" Basically , " said Alan Johnson , Home Secretary , " we are going to request that journalists take relief to the areas that they report on . They wouldn ' t be there if everything was hunky dory , so any relief that can be got through by any means is welcome . In the UK we are obviously asking that they take basic supplies to cut off villages and farms , but should there be a proper natural disaster somewhere in the world , all those thousands of journalists that somehow manage to get through to report on how cut off it is , can take some medical aid , and the like .
