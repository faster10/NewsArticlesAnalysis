" We were the better side out there today ! " Summerbee fumed . " we played some wonderful stuff . Silva is a fantastic player , and probably the finest exponent of the arse goal in the game today . Trouble is , everybody ' s going to be talking about Rooney and his bloody spectacular shitting overhead kick . But we ' re not worried they know we can match them in every department with the possible exception of results . One of these days , we ' re gonna come here and give ' em a right proper tankin ' ! Just like we did , back in the day . And I will love it ! LOVE IT ! when that happens ! "
