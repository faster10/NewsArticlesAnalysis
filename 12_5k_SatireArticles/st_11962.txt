I must say , old bean , they sure don ' t train engineers like they used to . Being allowed to bring a calculating device into an exam is sacrilege . If you cannot determine the square root of 5 in your head , you deserve to be shot . In fact , the Faculty used to enforce that rule literally until 1939 , when the blasted Liberals came into power . There were so many bodies in the examination hall after the first year calculus final , you ' d think you were at Dieppe . On the plus side , the university had to employ extra custodians to clear out the corpses , which created jobs . Forgive me , I tend to drift off topic in my old age .
