" They waited till late in the day and the birds must have eaten all night " , stated owner George Hatcher . " We have autos that have scratches , paint ruined in some cases , the pavement slicked down and we will have to remove the cars one at a time to clean it . Then we will have to get in some professionals to see how to clean up our buildings and lot . I really don ' t think 500 , 000 will do it . "
