After I took up my new post , I wasted no time getting my buddy Barabbas elected to office and we ran a neat little racket on new civic construction road works around Jerusalem until some two faced bastard ratted on us . We got it sorted with Roman help . . . but it taught me a lot . Never trust " your own " , as my old man used to say shortly before they hanged him for stealing horses . Thankfully , shit always blows over . That is the first and last maxim in political life . And , of course , you have to take care of your women . That , above all .
