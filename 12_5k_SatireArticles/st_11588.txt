Martin continued , " He could have a smoke ghost sneak into his house and kill him , he could get hired as a prostitute to a psychopath who shoots him with arrows . He could have a little girl who borrows the likeness of another little girl kill him ooh , I forgot , he could just have a huge pot of molten gold dumped on his head , he could be in a gladiator match , hell he could just be a character another character gets told about the death of from a raven . Oh ! Exposure too , plus getting trampled by a horse , falling out a moon door . Did I say burned to death ? That could happen to him in a weird alternative way too , like have him suspended in a suit of armour over a bonfire . Or heck , maybe just blood poisoning , no need to reinvent the wheel , here . "
