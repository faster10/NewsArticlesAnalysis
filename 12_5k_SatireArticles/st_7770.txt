" Michael is one of many trans age people he is a child trapped in the body of an adult , " said Dr Myers . " With this surgery we will shorten and make narrower all the bones in his body and replace his internal organs with ones donated from children . He ' s lucky to have such a thick skull , because we can make his head significantly smaller without removing any neural tissue . His eyes , nose , and mouth , may end up being disproportionately large , but that will make him all the more adorable . Actually I take that back about the nose , it ' s too small as it is . And we ' ll have to permanentely wax off his facial hair and transplant some peach fuzz to his upper lip of his buttocks . "
