" It ' s not fair , " said Darren McHoney , a phone thief from Manchester . " I ' ll trek up and down Deansgate , or round the Locks all night , and maybe find one iPhone . It ' s just not worth the effort to take these other white phones . They ' re normally pay as you go with a quid left on them , or worth about a fiver . You can get ninety quid for an iPhone , now that ' s worth pegging it down the street away from the victim . "
