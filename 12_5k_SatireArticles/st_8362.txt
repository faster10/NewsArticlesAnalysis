The Atlanta falcons squared off against the Detroit Lions in Wembley stadium as part of the NFL England series . After an adequate version of Star Spangled Banner and obviously better version of God Save the Queen it was time to take the field . The Falcons looked to be in good spirits even though they are giving up the advantage of one of their home games to play in London . They started the game by beating the pants off the lions in the first half . 21 0 . Troy Aikman the announcer seemed baffled as did everyone else . Was their a mix up in jerseys ? This cannot be the same team who has under performed all year after allowing the rest of their opponents the advantage of watching their preparation for the season on the HBO series hard knocks .
