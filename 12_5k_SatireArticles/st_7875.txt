" There are still some areas of a car that could do with increased safety , " said McWilliams . " Airbags , for instance , are really dangerous . If one of those hits you , you know about it . We are going to wrap the airbags in bubble wrap . Also , the support struts of the car and the dashboard will be covered in bubble wrap for those impacts not severe enough to cause airbag deployment . Should the car occupants strike their head on a hard surface the bubble wrap will protect them from injury . It has the advantage that it is light , and adds virtually no weight to the car . "
