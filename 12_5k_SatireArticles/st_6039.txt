According to keynote speaker Gary Bettman , the Stanley Cup ' s greatest role has been changing societal attitudes about intellectually challenged trophies and getting people to understand that many of them have faced brutal neglect , been called terrible names from the moment they were first awarded , and , in some cases , been victims of physical and sexual abuse . Bettman said the Stanley Cup has made a lasting impact , adding that before it became an advocate for the rights of physically and mentally impaired awards , it wasn ' t taboo for people to call them " stupid " or mock them for their abnormal shapes .
