" We ' ve been trying to find some way to take this thing down , but so far nothing ' s worked , " said Monsanto security chief Lydia Jarrett , citing steel doors torn completely from their hinges , tunnels bored through solid concrete by means of a highly concentrated form of citric acid , and the failure of industrial strength herbicides pouring from the facility ' s sprinkler system to slow any of the destruction . " We used a trellis and a bed of fresh , loamy soil to lure it into a waste processing bay where we intended to have it incinerated that is , if anything can still hurt it at this point but it escaped at the last minute . It ' s almost as if it knew what we were planning . "
