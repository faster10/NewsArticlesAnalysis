" My God , it was horrible the president let out this awful scream , a look of terror flashed through his eyes , and then his body started getting larger and larger , bursting through his suit coat and shredding his pants , " said Deputy Secretary of Labor Chris Lu , explaining how the cowering commander in chief fell to his knees and started convulsing after being doused , his head lashing back and forth and his voice dropping an octave with each pained , guttural moan . " A Secret Service agent ran over to try to help , but Obama threw him through a wall . After maybe a minute or two , his body became too big for the room , and the ceiling crashed down around us , and we all started running . That ' s when we heard him start roaring something about corporate tax policy . "
