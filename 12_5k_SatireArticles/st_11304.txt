And Vegas itself was in an uproar , with odds makers in an mind boggling flurry of activity , with the usual statistics and computer models rendered virtually useless in calculating who holds an advantage if any . According to Richard B . Dressler , race and sports book manager for the Imperial Palace in Las Vegas , " There is no accurate or accepted methodology in place to determine a favorite . " Many insiders were speculating it may indeed be an extremely rare 50 50 match up . Even the coin toss at the Superbowl has slightly different than 50 50 odds , based on the weight of the coin being ever so slightly in favor of it landing on heads . " This may be one of the most exactly even matches in Vegas history . "
