Emergency rescue teams , working with what Hedrick called " speed and efficiency on a level I ' d never before seen from them , of course , " recovered Schiller ' s body less than 40 minutes after Hedrick and substitute teacher Jeff Lindenbaum , 30 , met for dinner at a local seafood restaurant . Approximately 15 minutes later , Hedrick received a call from Ankeny police summoning her to the scene of the accident , as if her immediate presence would somehow bring Schiller ' s bloated , waterlogged corpse back to life .
