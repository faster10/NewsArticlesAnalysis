" Corrupt CEOs must be treated like any other criminal , " Bush said . " The damage they do to this country , eroding investors ' faith in our stock market and corporate institutions , is extremely serious . I would like to deliver a clear message to those who would bilk hardworking Americans out of their hard earned 401K plans while greedily lining their own pockets : We cannot , and will not , sit idly by while this threat continues to mount in the Middle East . Iraq has stood in violation of U . N . resolutions since 1991 by refusing to allow weapons inspectors into the palace compound , where we suspect there are laboratories for creating weapons of mass destruction . We must remove the dictator Saddam Hussein and install a government that is committed to working toward free and democratic elections for the nation of Iraq . "
