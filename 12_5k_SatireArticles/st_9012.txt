We should not be cruel to Grifinik however unpleasant it is it is largely harmless and in better times is amusing a willing dancing bear , a clumsy if unendearing mimic . By all means throw eggs at it it loves the attention but will rapidly tire and crawl under a stone somewhere . Left to its own devices it is as likely simply to die of forgetfulness as it is to get up again . This is its natural life , not a happy one by our values , but ideal for the Grifinik .
