Spokesman David Blender said in a news conference that : " We started doing research into the number of mice and rats used in our expirements . After looking at the numbers that died of cancer due to different color dyes , nicotine , recreational drugs , artificial sweeteners , yogurt , and broccoli , we found that there were actually no lab rats or mice left over . In fact , no rodents have died of old age or natural causes in a laboratory in the United States in thirty years , with the noted exception of one stoned white mouse who got out of his maze and tried to attack the lab tech ' s cat . We consider his quick ingestion and death to be caused by the a reaction to the drug making him feel like super rodent and not the fault of the siamese . "
