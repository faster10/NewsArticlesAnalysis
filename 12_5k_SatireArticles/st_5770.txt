Anszczak was the first school photographer to offer matte finish . He was the first to seat subjects on a stool , to direct them in proper placement of their hands , and to offer them the use of a black plastic comb before the photo was taken . He pioneered use of soft focus , previously seen only in Hollywood glamour portraits , in senior year photos . And he introduced the now famous " fence post , wagon wheel , and bale of hay " tableau , which became an industry standard .
