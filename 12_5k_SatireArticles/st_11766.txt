According to believers of this ancient mysticism , if a house does not cut down a pine tree , place it within their abode and decorate it with lanterns , glass bulbs with hooks and shiny pieces of plastic , gifts from the heavens will not be bestowed upon the family , as they have been deemed unworthy to the red , bearded Saint , whose single minded duty is to tally the deeds of the living , and judge them on a year by year basis , placing them in one of two categories : naughty or nice .
