One detractor , a part of the 10 in the town that disagrees with the award , is a man we ' ll call Leroy the HVAC Repairman ( no relation to Joe the Plumber ) . Leroy works 62 hours a week just to pay his bills and feed his family . Said Leroy , " there are parts of this town where I won ' t go because they refuse to pay me . They tell me to go get me some Obama money and treat me like crap when they want me to service their broken down air conditioners . They think it ' s a government right to be cool in the summer and that they shouldn ' t have to pay for that either .
