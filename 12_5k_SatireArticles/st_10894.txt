As we tour the plant located on the shore near Osaka , Miss Inoue shows us the vast secret tunnels full of laborers that cut the whales into pieces small enough to fit into the massive cleaving machines . It is no secret that undocumented workers , mostly from Thailand and China , for years have labored in extreme cold temperatures to process the vast number of whales needed to supply Japan ' s appetite for whale meat . The secret is the huge increase of such workers here in Osaka Prefecture over the last 12 months to process fish and whale scraps . The government has now hired TEPCO TEPCOW to convert the waste stream into electricity .
