" Allen ' s a real prankster , " fellow sales manager Gene Budzig said . " I remember that one time last month , when Bill McCullers was saying all morning that he had to make sure to FedEx a proposal that day , but when he went to drop off the package , Wohl told him the FedEx guy had just left . You should ' ve seen the look on Bill ' s face when Allen told him he was just kidding ! Boy , was he relieved ! "
