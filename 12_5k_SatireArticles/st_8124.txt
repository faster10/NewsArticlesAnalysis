As Kleinfeld and other researchers have pointed out , this is a massive investment of time for staggeringly little in return . As they well know , as their research methods were meticulous . " We used an eye dropper to determine the exact amount of drops in one gallon of water , which was 90 , 804 , but then tested several different grades of gasoline to come up with a representative sampling . We had 13 grad student volunteers work on that alone . We also videotaped and timed 317 different men and women from all walks of life from coast to coast to come up with the average time for pump shaking . Volumes of records and datas on the price of labor versus cost of gasoline from 1963 to 2009 was also done by a private research firm we contracted out to . " , related Kleinfeld , " But it was worth it . "
