" Sometime last September , we were filming the big breakup scene for Beachball between Tony Charlton and Heidi Adamle in my backyard , " Draper said . " Right in the middle of it , this beach ball from the kid playing in the pool next door lands right between them . Instead of re shooting the scene , Tony picks it up and says , ' Remember this beach ball ? You got it for me that time we went to the beach . Now I ' m giving it back to you . ' We ended up changing the title from Crushed to Beachball because of that scene . Those kinds of moments , where you take a screw up and turn it into gold , are the reason I dreamed of one day becoming a student filmmaker . "
