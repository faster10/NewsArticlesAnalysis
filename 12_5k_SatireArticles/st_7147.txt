And here ' s a picture of a guy who ' s so crazy about guns that he sold every one of his guitars and spent all the proceeds to purchase every machine gun ever manufactured , foreign and domestic , though the history of time . He ' s so crazy about machine guns , in fact , that he has two models of every machine gun ever made . He ' s got such a complete collection that he stores all of them in a large 100 , 000 square foot warehouse somewhere near Waco , Texas .
