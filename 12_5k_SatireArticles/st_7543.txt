Reaction from the Jewish Community is mixed . Rabbi Yosi ben Eliezer of Congregation Am Yisrael Chai offered this comment when asked about the proposal . " Nu ? They want to give a special award to Hitler ( may his name be blotted out ! ) for providing ample villains to Hollywood ? The move is not without precedence , I suppose . For over 2000 years we ' ve been declaring that Haman ' s name be blotted out , and yet , he still takes the main stage in every Purim Schpiel . Maybe someday we will delight children with such irreverent portrayals of Hitler , too ? "
