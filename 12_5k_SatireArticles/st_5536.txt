For the record , I ' m not above helping out in this area . I ' ve got a commitment to my own paper , but occasionally time allows me to create original political art for other publications as well . Editors : don ' t be intimidated by my long years in this business ! I want you to feel comfortable approaching me . Perhaps we could go out to dinner and discuss a project you have on the horizon , make a night of it . I know a few spots we could become more than just work colleagues , we could become friends . I could call you on the weekends , check and see if there are any new illustration assignments worth discussing over at your home while we grill on the barbeque or mix cocktails at the wet bar . Again , I want you to feel comfortable . My calendar has a few openings so just give me a call .
