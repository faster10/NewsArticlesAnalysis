" I want to assure fans and athletes around the world that very little will change now that you are all my fans and athletes , " Cuban said . " Of course , there will be a review and streamlining of all the rules as soon as possible , so I can settle certain things once and for all , like what is and isn ' t a foul , and where the Cubs will be playing after they leave Chicago , and what Dwyane Wade will be doing now that he ' s banned from basketball . Oh , yeah , and the Olympics are canceled . And I need to see former Texas Longhorns softball player Cat Osterman in my office tomorrow evening , dressed appropriately for dinner at a fairly good but charmingly low key steakhouse . Anyway , I realize how important sports are , and want to reassure the world that with the increased cost will come greatly increased enjoyment . "
