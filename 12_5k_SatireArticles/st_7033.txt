Suddenly , MrWang ' s eyes turned wide , looking totally horrified . His face grew paler and paler . He tried hard to free either of his hands . But both were secured tightly , one with a rope tied to his back , and the other engaged in the fight . After struggling a bit , the old man finally collapsed to the ground . The audience began to shout and the referee began blowing his whistle . Chaos followed . A paramedic standing nearby , just in case , ran in to help . After feeling his pulse for a second , he pronounced MrWang dead .
