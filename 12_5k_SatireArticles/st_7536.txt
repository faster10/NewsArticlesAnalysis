" It ' s like she ' s real . . . and of all the women I ' ve met she has to be the hottest . She likes to listen to modern rock music , even though in the game she has classical music on her stereo . There ' s so much we can learn from Lara in developing new Tomb Raider games . The only sad thing is that she won ' t let us make any more . She wants out of the whole TR programme to do something new and exciting . Another problem with her is that she ' s already escaped from my computer . Yesterday she ' d managed to get to Dick Flower ' s computer via the network . There ' s nothing stopping her getting out via a modem either . It ' s quite scary when you come to think of it really .
