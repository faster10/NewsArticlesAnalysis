When challenged that the Australian government and the head of ABS ( Stats ) had given iron clad assurances regarding the protection of personal data they replied " that is a silly worry , of course your data is safe , after all we are from the government , no Australian need fear any potential of personal information mis use unless they were a terrorist " . Further " our computer systems are run by multinationals with security teams from China , Russia , ISIS and outer Mongolians and with such a world class operation there was no possibility of any data abuse " .
