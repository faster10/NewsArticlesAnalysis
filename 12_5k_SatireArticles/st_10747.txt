" Carlos de los Chupacabras " , Cartel Hit man : When El Presidente Obama told the Hispanic people " punish our enemies , " we really thought he meant " kill Americans " . . . and when he said " reward our friends , " the first thing I thought of was the signs he put up around Interstate 8 , Arizona that told Americans " KEEP OUT DRUG CARTEL TURF ! " I said to myself , " it ' s about time someone told the Americans who is in charge , and made them get out of our way . . . thank you , El Presidente Obama . "
