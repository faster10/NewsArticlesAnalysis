The incident of which the president spoke is so big that it fills over a third of the space that Wikipedia devotes to the entire town in its article , " Ferguson , Missouri , " which notes , for the curious reader and the scholar alike , that the town takes its name from a man by the name of Ferguson , who lived there in the late nineteenth century and may have fathered the town , as he did several other of Missouri ' s great cities . The Wiki article also lists the " notable people " among the townsfolk as " Michael Brown . " Curiously , there is no mention of Jesse Jackson , Al Sharpton , or U . S . Attorney General Eric Holder as " Notable people . "
