" The first Avengers film made billions of dollars worldwide , but when the sequel came out , people said , You know what , instead of waiting in line for this , let ' s just act it out at home or go over to the neighbors ' and see them perform it , " ' said Walt Disney Studios spokesperson Eric Rudolph , who admitted that he and his wife recently decided not to see Straight Outta Compton in theaters , with both agreeing they would just wait until the script showed up on the internet and then act it out at a later date . " The fact of the matter is , the industry is going to have to pivot to accommodate the new reality of people who just want to wind down after a long day by going into their room , shutting the door , and acting out a film alone particularly if other family members or roommates are acting out another movie in the living area .
