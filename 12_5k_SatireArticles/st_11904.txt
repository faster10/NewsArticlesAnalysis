Former college roommate Eric Hearst recalls a similar incident a few months ago : " Man , this one time , we were on the bus , right , and , as usual , Jeff was standing in the middle of the aisle , not holding the pole . The bus starts slowing down very suddenly , and he lost his balance and fell to the oor . He stayed there , lying on the oor , for the rest of the trip . Then he took out a book and read it until we got off . He told me that he preferred reading lying down . "
