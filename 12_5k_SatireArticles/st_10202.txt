" What a slap in the face to Mexican workers , opening the highways to dangerous trucks on Labor Day weekend , an American holiday , " said a motor vehicle department official . " Plus , I don ' t think these gringo drivers understand how driving works in Mexico . I can estimate a 20 increase in traffic accidents . We must close the borders soon My 12 year old son drives better than the American tourists that rent cars here . One can only imagine the amount of destruction and chaos . "
