" As medical professionals , there is a limit to how white we can make your teeth , " ADA president T . Howard Jones said . " Using various new tooth whitening procedures , we can remove the extrinsic staining from your teeth and make them look their absolute whitest . But that ' s still not enough for you psychos . You need whiter . Well , if you want to go to Mexico and have someone implant a black light in your gums so your teeth glow an unearthly white , go nuts . I ' m just telling you what we ' re medically and legally capable of at this time . "
