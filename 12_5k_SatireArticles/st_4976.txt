Canada City , Canada ' s largest community , is located in a place called a " province , " a subdivision not unlike the cantons of Switzerland . There are 10 Canadian provinces in all , from Nova Scotia in the east to British Columbia in the west . And , much like America ' s states , nearly every one of the provinces has its own capital . But make no mistake there ' s nothing provincial about these provinces . Canada has both feet planted firmly in the 20th century .
