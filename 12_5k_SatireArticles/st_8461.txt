The hope for Dice K is that he will bring out his greatest weapon soon . Early spring hype had it that Dice K had a " gyro ball " that no one could touch . The funny thing is , the Diceman just smiled when asked about it , but never seemed to throw it . He doesn ' t talk much anyway , since there is language communication problem coupled with his fear that the Red Sox are going to want their check back . He doesn ' t know how to say , " No way ! " These things tend to keep him quiet .
