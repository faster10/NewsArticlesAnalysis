Some abject , manacled black men and women were hauled before the stage and summarily tried for and lynched for abstruse crimes that they had in no way committed , while the fratboys proceeded to roast weenies , s ' mores and marshmallows on the fires engulfing the clapboard crosses , and as some of the black men and women were also roasted alive on the comburent roods , the fratboys persisted in roasting their weenies ( unfortunately not their actual weenies , as far as this highly compromised and morally stunned reporter is concerned ) even on these hellish fires .
