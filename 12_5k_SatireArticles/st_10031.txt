BILLINGSGATE POST : Bill Clinton , in his stem winder speech before the Democratic Convention Wednesday evening , spoke of how he first met Hillary as a young girl at Yale Law School . He raved about his future soul mate ' s virtues : " She wore no make up , horn rimmed glasses , and had extra ordinary thick ankles and hairy armpits . I was instantly attracted to her because she was the first human being I had ever met that could lie even better than I could . Quite frankly , that is the spiritual bond that has kept us together for these years . "
