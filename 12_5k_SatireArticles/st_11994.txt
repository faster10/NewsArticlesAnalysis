One of the songs , " It ' s a Hard Knock Life for Us " will go through a change in the lyrics . It will become " It ' s a Hard Knocked Up Life . " Other music in the film will also change . Instead of the positive , upbeat " The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow , " Annie will sing " Yo , Yo , Yo , Bitches , the pimp be drivin ' here tomorrow and shit ! " Another song change will be " Let ' s Go To The Movies . " In this version , they will sing " Let ' s Go To The Crack House ! "
