Next thing I know , I ' m analyzing the menu ' s content as a text , or ' text , ' subjecting it to a rigorous critical reevaluation informed by Derrida , De Man , etc . , as a construct , or ' construct , ' made up of multi varied and , in fact , often self contradictory messages , or ' meanings , ' derived from the cultural signifiers evoked by the menu , or ' menu , ' and the resultant assumptions within not only the mind of the menu ' s ' authors ' and ' readers , ' but also within the larger context of our current postmodern media environment . Man , I ' ve got to finish my dissertation before I end up in a rubber room . "
