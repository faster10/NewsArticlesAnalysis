" I ' m a little sick of it all , " Jagger admitted . " If I were to say I ' ve had a lifelong significant other , it would most likely be Keith Richards , but believe me , it ' s been totally platonic through and through . There ' s nothing about men that I like in the sexual sense but being that we ' ve led the band for scores of years , Keith ' s my only near and dear , true , lifelong friend . Charlie Watts and Ron Wood come in a close second and third , but Keith ' s always been my number one bloke , " Jagger said .
