Now , I ' m as Free Presbyterian as they come , never touched none of that oul ' demon drink . But if there ' s anything worse than the Divvil ' s buttermilk , it ' s them there oul ' barbiturates , so it is ! I mean , I was shocked , I never heard no man o ' God talking about them things . Sure it ' s such divvilment , even the Lord Almighty didn ' t want to poison his lips by speakin ' of it in His word !
