" Jill and I weren ' t living together long before she started getting irritated by how small the apartment was , " Eiler said . " She was always complaining about how she didn ' t have space anymore . Then , she got this idea to get a bigger place , but I couldn ' t really afford it , since I was just barely scraping by with what I earned bartending at Mickey ' s . I really liked bartending , and it allowed me flexible hours for band practice and gigs . But , like Jill said , I was 25 now and shouldn ' t be living hand to mouth . "
