" She ate my uncle Luigi , " said Adrienne Barbeau , Miss Arthur ' s co star from the television series Maude , from her home in Burbank , CA . " He came to the set in ' 73 and asked me to get Bea ' s autograph for him . I told him to go and get it himself , she doesn ' t bite . When he didn ' t come back , I went to Bea ' s trailer and found her wiping her mouth with the bus ticket I ' d sent him . She denied it , of course , and the police never pursued it , not even after she was subsequently rushed to the hospital , two days later , in order to have his wedding ring removed from her lower intestine . Her people claimed it was a gallstone , but I got the ex rays through the private detective I hired and , trust me , most gallstones don ' t say , ' To my beloved Luigi , love always , Maria . " '
