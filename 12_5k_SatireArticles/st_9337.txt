Peter Porter of the American Geographical Society said at this mornings press conference . " The bands are not 100 rubber if they were they would disintegrate in a couple of weeks . But they are mixed with silicone which could have a devastating effect on wildlife . Already we are seeing sea birds caught up in bands but I am most worried about what will happen when the slick reaches the feeding grounds of Blue Whales . If that happens we could have an environmental catastrophe on our hands . "
