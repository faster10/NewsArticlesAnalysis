" That ' s not strictly speaking , altogether true , " long suffering wife Anne said . " The truth is that the tight fisted skinflint bastard rarely ever takes me out , much less to a five star hotel with a Michelin starred restaurant . But I ' d bought a Colleen Nolan sequinned jacket off eBay and there ' s no way I was going to let Christmas go by without showing that off . So I gave him some spiel about tombs and cathedrals and the daft sod fell for it . So , Deutschland here we come ! "
