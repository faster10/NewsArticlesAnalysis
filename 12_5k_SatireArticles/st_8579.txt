The aforementioned Johnny " Chubby Biceps " Watson regularly comes close to winning a medal despite only being barely able to type his own name ( It always takes him about three minutes to find the W ' in Watson ' . Mind you , he ' s good at typing the letters ATS ' but he gets stuck again on the O ' and it takes him some time to find the N ' though not quite as long as it takes him to find the W ' ) . However , as he almost always scores maximum points in the strength events , he is usually there or thereabouts in the medals shake up ( Best ever result Bronze medal 1993 ) .
