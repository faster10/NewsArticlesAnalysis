" I never looked at her , " Ulrich released in a press statement after the rumor went public . " I ' ve never even met her , and if I did I wouldn ' t look at her . She hasn ' t been attractive since " The Mask " . . well maybe " Charlie ' s Angels " . Now she looks like she should be in Middle Earth looking for " the precious " or living in Harry Potter ' s closet . " Metallica singer and Cowardly Lion stunt double James Hetfeild had this to add , " I can ' t believe what we ' ve stooped to , Steel Panther are out there curing cancer , while we ' re arguing with this douchebag . HURRRRAH ! I knew we should have played at the Linc in Philly instead . We love Philly , we even played in their parking lot at the Wells Union Corechovia Center . "
