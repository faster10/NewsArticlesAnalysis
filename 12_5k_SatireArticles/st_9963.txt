Milkforce and I snuck into the Trump Rally at Two Forks , Tennessee . We brought Stosh Armstrong with us for protection in case they started throwing punches . Stosh kept a low profile , staying about ten feet behind us in the crowd . It ' s not that he wasn ' t noticed . It ' s hard not to notice a six foot seven Canadian lumberjack with bad teeth and mediocre health . He just kept his distance from us so people wouldn ' t think we were together .
