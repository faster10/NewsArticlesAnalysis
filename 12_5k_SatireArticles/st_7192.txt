When the user starts to use the computer , 100 " WindowCredits " are available . Every time an application is launched , or a window on the desktop is opened or closed , or other " major user interface actions " are performed , a WindowCredit is debited from this total . When the initial 100 WindowCredits have been used up , a popup message alerts the user , and a further set of WindowCredits may be purchased online , with the purchase price deducted from the credit card . Until a further block of WindowCredits is purchased and installed , no further operation of the computer is possible .
