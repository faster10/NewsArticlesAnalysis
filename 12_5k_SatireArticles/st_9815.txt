Some have suggested that perhaps a complete ban on mirrors is an overreaction . They ' ve offered a compromise that pocket sized mirrors and semi reflective surfaces be used in extreme cases , however Jindal was adamant that full and complete ban was necessary to prevent any sliver of reality from seeping into one ' s consciousness .

" He added , " Walking , talking , acting , sleeping , crapping and breathing like a southern white man is a 24 7 effort , that simply cannot be disrupted by mirrors reflecting reality . "
