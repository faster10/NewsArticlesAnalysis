Again , luckily for NASA , the Russian government launched its malicious campaign to foil our exploration attempts before their quasar production techniques had been refined enough to cause any serious damage . Many of the quasar mirages created are only a couple of arcseconds apart from one another , when viewed from Earth ( for those of you who don ' t know , an arcsecond is one thirty six hundredth of a degree in length ) . One example of this is the first quasar ever discovered , 3C 273 , in the year 1962 .
