" Sometimes , I ' ll hear Brandon taking a shower , and I ' ll think , ' Hope you appreciate that shower , ' " Raschi said . " I usually feel guilty after I think things like that , because a father ' s supposed to want only the best for his kids . But deep down inside , part of me resents the fact that when I was his age , I had to go down to the YMCA to shower because my father was too drunk too fix anything . "
