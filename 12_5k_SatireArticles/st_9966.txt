Trump inadvertently kept trying to go one way and the elephant the other . It became a battle of wills . Fortunately for Trump , Nancy would not pull her lead rope out of her trainer ' s hands .

She had learned her lessons well as a young elephant and never challenged authority no matter how mad she got or how stupid the person trying to direct her movements was .
