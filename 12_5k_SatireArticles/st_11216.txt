Having recently trashed their parliamentary majority in a strategic election move that originally intended to nobble the senate they were now looking for alternative spin approaches . We look forward to liaising with Trumps government team to find a basis for developing better policy . American spin always had a superior effect here and we are worried Australians will find out soon we have trashed their socio economic future for some petty short term political gains . So it is important we ramp up the noise until we get soma gas and national surveillance bills through parliament .
