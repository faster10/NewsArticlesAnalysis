Take it easy Altoids , you ' ve been out for almost 15 minutes . Yes , I know . Horrible sight . Machine malfunction and all . An accident just luck of the draw you might say . " Altoids fully awoke and reached for the glass of water the stranger was extending to her . " Thanks . " " Altoids , this is Phineas Barger Doctor Phineas Barger ! He ' s agreed to assist us with our last patient . " Eloise was fully composed now and could see the man clearly . Odd , she thought . He was dressed in inmate ' s clothing , but had on surgeon ' s scrubs over the blue uniform . Even stranger , he had a hand scrawled Post it note on his forehead that read ' Eat Me . " ' . " But Dr Ward , he ' s an inmate . " " I know it ' s a tad irregular and all , but before Dr Barger ' s so called ' troubles , ' he was one of Springfield University ' s Medical School ' s best teaching surgeons . We need him for the next very delicate procedure . In fact , our patient is in the operating room right now . Feel up to it ?
