Mrs Brown said : " I used the last of the sea salt for the turkey sandwiches . You know what it ' s like , you ' ve got to get rid of it before it goes off and what with the weather I ' d just not had chance to get out and buy some more salt and didn ' t realise our levels were so low . There wasn ' t a sprinkling left for the PM ' s favourite dippy eggs , but he took it with his usual stiff upper lip and droopy jaw . "
