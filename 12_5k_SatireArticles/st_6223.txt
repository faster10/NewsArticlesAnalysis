Though Lushniak stated that being 19 involves a certain level of risk , noting that such individuals were highly susceptible to stupid , reckless decisions , he assured reporters that such mistakes didn ' t have serious consequences because you ' re only 19 and damned if it doesn ' t feel like you ' re going to live forever .
