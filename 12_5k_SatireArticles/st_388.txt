According to attorney Reiss , however , the decision in Bonds v . Davidson was inapplicable . Though the court upheld the original ruling on the field , Reiss was quick to note that Bonds was left handed , and thus the case set legal precedent with third base umpires , not first base umpires . Reiss believed Wright being right handed constituted a legitimate enough reason to file a writ of certiorari , or " cert petition , " an order for the case to be heard by the Supreme Court .
