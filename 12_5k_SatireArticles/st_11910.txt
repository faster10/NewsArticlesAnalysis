" It ' s not a cabinet shuffle , because every time there ' s a cabinet shuffle he locks the door and plays Wagner ' s Flight of the Valkyries for two hours . And he ' s not preparing a budget , because again , he locks the door after taking in a dozen pens , two reams of spreadsheet paper and a tub of vaseline . But today , he has ominously left the door open , so everyone can just see him sitting there at his desk , with that unsettling toothy omen across his face . "
