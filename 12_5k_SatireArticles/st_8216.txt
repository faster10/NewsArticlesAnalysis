1 ) That could bounce as high as the upper tiers . 2 ) That bounced over players heads , even on ground passes . We were in continuous stitches watching the players jumping up and down trying to catch it . 3 ) It could skid out of play faster than a racing bob sleigh . Players had to be resuscitated by medical teams after collapsing with exhaustion chasing pointless long through balls . 4 ) Teams that liked to play first time passes looked hilariously incompetent as the ball increased its speed by 10mph each touch . After nine passes , they didn ' t know where the ball was and were looking around in bewilderment . 5 ) Players boots appeared to have invisible springs , as the ball repeatedly shot away from them when trying to control it . 6 ) Goalkeepers continually dived the whole game , just in case any 1100mph shots came their way . Although to be fair , most ended up bringing down helicopters and air balloons hovering over the stadiums . 7 ) Crosses , whether short or long , never came down until they reached the safety of the crowd and then rebounded straight back into play without anybody noticing . 8 ) Team tactics became redundant , as players got used to passing once , and then stopping the ball in their own time .
