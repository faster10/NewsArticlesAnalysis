After the meeting Loss spoke with this reporter : " Religious nutcases get on my nerves . They call me a baby killer when I want to stop teen pregnancy as much as they do . Sometimes abortion is the necessary option . They just don ' t think through there own belief system . I spoke with Pastor Erikman of Faith Temple about this and asked him what happens when a baby dies and does not have faith in Jesus . He told me that until a child reaches an age old enough to have faith if it dies the Lord takes it right to heaven to be with Him .
