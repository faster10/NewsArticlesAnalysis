We ' ll let Chip tell you first hand what he saw . " Well , Furyk looked really disgusted by the red Scottish Tartan Jacket he ' d just won . He was making a hand motion like he wanted to rip his eyes right out of their sockets and sticking his index finger down his throat . Then he handed a plump looking fellow wearing a bright pink golf shirt the ugly jacket , in exchange for what looked to be a sweet stack of cash . Furyk did kept the bronze statue part of the trophy though , even nuzzled it on the nose a little , right there in front of this other guy . Looked like it got weird . Then Furyk took his giant check and the little bronze statue guy , got on a jet ski and hi tailed it out of there , thinking no one else had seen him . "
