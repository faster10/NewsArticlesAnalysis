The demand for efficiency among mobile and regular internet users has increased in recent years . For example , instead of taking the time to type " ok " , which on a regular keyboard involves one ring finger keystroke followed by one with the middle finger , a common shortcut is to type " kk " . This shortcut saves time because it involves two keystrokes , but requires the use of only one finger instead of two . Examples of other time saving shortcuts include " coo " instead of " cool " and " wut " instead of " what " , saving one full keystroke each .
