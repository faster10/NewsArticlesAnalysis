" I left the show in 1986 , and about a year later , I got a rash all over my face that just wouldn ' t go away , " Gillis said . " Then I started having debilitating migraines and shooting pains in my back . It was when my fingers went numb that I knew something had to be wrong . I bounced from doctor to doctor , until a physician in Beverly Hills sat me down and asked me if I ' d ever been exposed to comic props . Finally , I knew it wasn ' t all in my head . I knew it was the slime . "
