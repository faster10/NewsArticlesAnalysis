" I ' ve seen measures put in place to protect the rights of left handed people , " said one protester at a Left Pride March , earlier this month . " But I think these measures should go further . I ' m ambidextrous , or handed fluid , as I prefer to be called . There is no provision for our protection . Too much emphasis is placed on the binary , you ' re either right or left , preferably right . What about people like me ? "
