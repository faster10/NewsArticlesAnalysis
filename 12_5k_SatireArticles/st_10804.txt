" What is quite obvious is that gas prices are controlled by the signs on the gas stations . I mean , everywhere that we have gone , the signs are all different . This makes no sense . Oil companies just sell oil , gas stations sell gas . So , neither one of these entities is at fault . The problem is that the people who make the signs are at fault . Honestly , how can you screw up on a number ? All the numbers on all the signs should be the same " .
