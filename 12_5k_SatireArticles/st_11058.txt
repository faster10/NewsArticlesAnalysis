Q : Can you explain more about the God particle ? A : It is difficult . The particle has inhuman intelligence . It directs the logical arrangements of all forms of matter in the universe . It controls evolution . And makes damn good wine if I may say so . It is what we have called hitherto Dark Matter . Q : So the God Particle is really God ? A : Yes , the God Particle is everywhere and nowhere . It is a singularity . It creates and directs all energy in the cosmos . It is God . Q : Really ? And what do you propose to do next ? A : We are going to make Him an offer He cannot refuse .
