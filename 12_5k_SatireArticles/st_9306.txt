Later that night , during a special interview on FoxNews Channel , Vice President Dick Cheney went further , describing the Irish artists ' activities as part of a larger cultural attack on America . Mr Cheney specifically highlighted Bono ' s campaign against global poverty as " " an insidious masquerade " , and the title of U2 ' s most recent album , How to Dismantle An Atomic Bomb , a " classic case of misdirection . " He also labeled the singer ' s appeals for Third World debt relief as " blatantly anti American , anti Western , anti democratic hate speech straight from the playbook of Osama Bin Laden . "
