However , today ' s audiences maybe puzzled at how De Palma was able to use the movie ' s climactic scene . In it , John Travolta as the protagonist drives his car down the middle of the street during Philadelphia ' s Liberty Day parade . He knocks over policeman , parade marchers , a marching band , and pedestrians . In today ' s terrorist conscious world , he would ' ve been cuffed and shot by the police , but not necessarily in that order .

Out one night making sound recordings , he happens upon a combination JFK assassination of a presidential hopeful and a Chappaquiddick car crash .
