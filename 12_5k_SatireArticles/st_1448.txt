" Warren seems really great , " McPherson said . " Now , the show is a different matter . There ' s no way it ' ll make it to November sweeps , much less February . I figure we ' ll run the first episode and get marginal numbers in the overnights . Then , after the figures drop in the second and third weeks , we ' ll put it on indefinite hiatus and burn off the leftover episodes during summer . It may seem odd to order 13 episodes when we ' ll probably air fewer than six , but Warren ' s a decent guy . He deserves a break . "
