" We ' ve worked for years to stabilize our society ' s dwindling population of sane , generally reasonable people , and within the safe confines of our refuge we ' ve finally seen their numbers start to bounce back a little , " said Josh Adelson , head of the Cornell research team , which moved the remaining members of the group into a protected habitat in 1998 to keep them from dying off completely . " Now , we can very gradually begin to release this rare breed of rational humans back into the general public . With luck , they can survive and prosper . "
