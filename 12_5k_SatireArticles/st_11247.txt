When questioned about the likelihood of an allied victory Major Dangers appeared pensive : " Due to the need to preserve the integrity of the assets we have had to rule out British air strikes against the installation . Dammit , it is frustrating ! The situation is clear , we need those cubicles and the enemy knows it . So far we have denied the enemy access 90 of the time and we figure they can ' t hold out forever , but this could make them all the more desperate , and combined with fundamentalist fanaticism we could be looking at a long wait . . . some of their soldiers haven ' t been relieved for a long time they may just give up , or they may make a run for it . If they do , we ' ll be facing a full scale enemy assault . It will be absolute chaos ! "
