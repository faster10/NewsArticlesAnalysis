The mayor noted a new kind of immigration at the approach of the fateful year : people who would " take refuge " in the village . Pilgrims climbing the unusual looking mountain to meditate regularly on top were , so far , tolerated but the fear of local officials is now to see the place overwhelmed by new arrivals : " I am beginning to wonder what will happen at the approach of 2012 when I see people already reserving accommodations . Besides , there are land and property speculations ! " No kidding , the mayor asked : " Will we have , like the movie " Encounters of the third kind " , to ask the Army to channel the influx ? . The Deputy Gilbert Cros holds about the same : " Bugarach , as well as Rennes le Chateau near , have always attracted all kinds of wacky . It was part of the folklore . But with the Internet and this story of doom , it takes an incredible importance . "
