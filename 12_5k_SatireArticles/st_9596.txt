" Don ' t worry , little people , our selections for Congress will be drummed into your little heads enough times in the next several months that their names will stick in your little brains when it comes time for you to vote . You won ' t even have to make any decisions about them because we ' re doing it for you . Think of it as just one more way for us to serve this great country of ours . And I do mean ours . Heh , heh . "
