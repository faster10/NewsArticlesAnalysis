" In recent years , Catholics the world over have been exposed to a multitude of sexual practices that , if not resisted , could enrich their lives and deepen their enjoyment of their partners , " said Cardinal Joaquin Navarro Valls , speaking on behalf of the pope . " As Catholics , we must remain vigilant , doing everything in our powers to resist such urges . Only the Lord ' s divine redemption can transform sex into a force for goodness by limiting it to the joyless context of married couples who wish to procreate . "
