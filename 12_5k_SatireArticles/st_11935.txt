All of that unhealthy food means more doctor visits , which means more time with free waiting room magazines . But talking with other patients is definitely the highlight . Some of the other people there are pretty inspiring . Last week I met a guy who had been smoking for thirty eight years and I was like , Whoa , can you imagine ? That ' s determination , that ' s stamina . I talked to my doctor , and he said it was doubtful that I could keep eating the way I do for thirty eight years , but I ' ve never been a quitter . Except for gym class .
