Continued Quinn : " Sometimes , I wish I ' d contracted a syndrome instead of a disease . Syndromes are often given descriptive names like Carpal Tunnel Syndrome . I begged the doctors to reclassify my disease as a syndrome and call it , say , ' Anal Blockage Syndrome , ' but he refused because , technically , a syndrome is defined as a group of various symptoms that culminate in an abnormality . Mine is not an abnormality : I just can ' t shit properly . "
