During the press conference , there was a bit of tension around the issue of who would undergo the sexual reassignment surgery . Hillary made her case , pointing out that her pant suits are unisex and there would be no need to reintroduce herself , for the 14th time , to the American public . In a nod to bi partisanship Trump conceded the point , but countered with his usual bluster I ' m not going to " drag " us into a recession . Despite the minor riff , both candidates appeared committed , going so far as to announce Chaz Bono and Caitlin Jenner as co chairs of transition . Clinton and Trump stated , " whether we are adding , or subtracting , Bono and Jenner are uniquely qualified to guide us . "
