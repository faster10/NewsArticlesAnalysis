Joking aside we at BATTL news are not surprised that parents no longer believe they are responsible for the well being of their own children . The country has fostered a culture of finger pointing because we are now able to claim compensation for " hurt feelings " because of this we no longer need to claim responsibility for our actions . You and you alone should be in charge of your child ' s health and if you don ' t want to be then don ' t breed .
