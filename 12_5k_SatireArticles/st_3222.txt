" I told those guys I could hit rim , " said Garnett , adding that " nobody believed him " when he informed his teammates that he touched , and indeed nearly grabbed , the rim in January while he was shooting around by himself in his driveway . " I always said that if I ' m warmed up enough , and I can get a running start from the other end of the court and don ' t have to worry about dribbling or anything , I can get rim no problem . "
