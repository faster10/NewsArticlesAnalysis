There is also a GPS app which will automatically direct you towards Mecca , along with an alarm which calls you to prayer five times a day . We have even got an app which calculates the number of Muslim births per day in the world . This one , ' jihad ' app , can keep you up to date with all the wars that we are currently involved in ( that ' s why it requires a massive memory ) . In a world where communication is vital , it is great to keep up to date and no self respecting Muslim should be without one !
