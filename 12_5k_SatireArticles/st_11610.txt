But the real question is , what are you doing to celebrate Black achievements this February ? Maybe ' s it ' s as simple as taking a moment of silence to commemorate the time my charges got downgraded to mail fraud , allowing me to be released from prison in May 2012 . Maybe you will take it upon yourself to create a small media empire and dedicate it to me . Or maybe you will take it upon yourself to renounce your Canadian citizenship to become a member in the British aristocracy ( good luck ! ) . Regardless of what you do , simply remembering that I am more than just a man is enough .
