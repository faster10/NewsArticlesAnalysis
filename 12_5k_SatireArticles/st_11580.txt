Some of the pivotal moments in modern history , would not have happened if it was not for Bono . Sensing the fall of communism and the Berlin Wall , he convinced David Hasselhoff to do a concert and helped him write the words , ' Looking for Freedom ' . In the 90s The UN was going to dismantle its humanitarian peace missions and its disaster relief funds due to fallout from previous missions , but Bono rang all the members of the G7 to stop this happening . He encouraged the cessation of fighting in Bosnia by donating his boots from the Joshua Tree album , and the fall of apartheid through singing ' In The Name of Love ' to the white minority government , which convinced them to release Mandela . Most recently the Arab Spring started after Bono began tweeting Egyptians to gather in squares and sing for freedom .
