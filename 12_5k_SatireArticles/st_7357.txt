What Really Happened on Hawaii : " OK so I took a dump on the Island ! It ' s like , I don ' t dare pollute the ocean any more since I had Greenpeace right on my tail , chasing me all over the South China Sea with their explosive harpoon ships . So , I saw the smokin ' volcano on the horizon and said to myself , what ' s a little more stuff on that contaminated sink hole . . though now I guess the natives are not exactly inclined to say ' Aloha ' . But hey , sh t happens . "
