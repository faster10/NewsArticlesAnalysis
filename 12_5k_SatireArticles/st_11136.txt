She went on to explain that office managers have less authority over volunteers who have no official position in the hierarchy of the office , and are thus less under the dominance of the manager . Most managers like to have a rigid chain of command where everyone knows their place and is dependent on , and controlled by , the person ranking above them in the hierarchy . They like to dominate their workers . Volunteers are to some extent outside their control and less likely to submit to domination : If they are not happy they can leave and go elsewhere . So , to these managers , the volunteers are treated as unreliable .
