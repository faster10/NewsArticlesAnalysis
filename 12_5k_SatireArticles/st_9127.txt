" George was supposed to have the Secret Service put blanks in my shotgun . But he wound up taking a nap instead . So the joke was on me when I pulled the trigger . And I must say , I got a real kick out of seeing the expression on that guy ' s bloody face . I don ' t think he was initially in on the prank , but I bet he remembers it every day of his life , especially if he uses a mirror in the morning . "
