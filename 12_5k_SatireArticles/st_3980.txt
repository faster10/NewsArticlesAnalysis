" When the big hurricane struck Florida in 1998 , I was scared until I found out its name was Earl , " Panama City , FL citizen Sam Hewer said . " I went to high school with a guy named Earl . He was a little wild , but ultimately harmless . In fact , we used to make fun of him . So when the storm hit and destroyed my house , it didn ' t seem so bad . It was like , ' Oh , there goes Earl again . ' "
