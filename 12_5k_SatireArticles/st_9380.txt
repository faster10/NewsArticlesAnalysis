A study done by NYU student Cindy Matthews early last year on over 1 , 000 people ages 14 38 who use social media frequently has found that 96 of the respondents don ' t care about what their " friends " or " followers " have to say or post . The study revealed that the majority of people just want others to see their posts , and that they only really care about a handful of people in their social network which they get updates from in person anyways .
