" I mean , we never thought anyone would take this stuff seriously , " said Cockburner . " Back in the 70 ' s , we began the movement as a kind of joke . The African American community was doing some great things , and someone said ' Why don ' t we start a women ' s movement , just for laughs . ' Of course we all thought that was a hoot . But before we knew it , the thing had really taken off . We thought for sure everyone would get the irony of women ' s lib when we started demanding not just equality , but special treatment based on gender .
