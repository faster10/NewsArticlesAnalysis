" My best customer knocks on my door at all hours whenever he ' s in need of a heroin fix , " Bastone said . " I ' d love to tell him to get lost , but he ' d probably just go to someone else ' s corner and take his contacts with him . Then there ' s the constant pressure to sell : I ' ve got to keep upping my purchases from my distributor , or else they ' ll give my corner to someone else . Christ , I need a vacation . "
