Reuther was on Nixon ' s enemies list after forming a bond with the Teamsters , ( what could be more life threatening than that ? ) , and taking on Nixon ' s policies in Vietnam . He was a staunch supporter of Martin Luther King and the Kennedy ' s which incurred the ire of FBI cross dresser Herbert Hoover . To this day over 200 pages of investigative reports on Reuther ' s death have not been released by the FBI including Hoover ' s private collection of Reuther ' s privates in the shower at the facility .
