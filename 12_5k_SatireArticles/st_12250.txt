The Reverend Louis Farrakhan , leader of the mostly African American religious movement called " The Nation of Islam , " is claiming that Charles Lindbergh ' s plane " The Spirit of St . Louis " was actually named after him . The airplane , which Lindbergh flew on the first solo , non stop flight from North America to Europe ( New York to Paris ) , was long thought to have been named for the city in Missouri ( as it was Lindbergh ' s home at the time of his flight ) .
