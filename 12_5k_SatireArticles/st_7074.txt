" Cloning chickens is the last thing the human race should be doing , " said Manfred Seiglefreed , Ph . D . , an Oxford Philosophy professor . " Throughout history , our race has used the wonders of science for the most nefarious of causes . The nuclear bomb is not the only such diabolical example . Creation of richer , sweeter ice creams is another . The result ? Amorphous 600 pound embonpoints who only stand five feet tall . And let ' s not forget manipulating chemistry to make ales , whiskeys , and vodkas with enough fire power to knock down full grown thoroughbred racehorses at mid day . "
