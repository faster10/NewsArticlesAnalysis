Neat freak Sandy McOrderly ' s clothes dresser had it with Sandy ' s consummate tidiness . Sandy ' s penchant for keeping all his clothes smartly tucked away in the various dresser drawers . His underwear perfectly folded in the top drawer . His socks tightly rolled into each other in his middle drawer and his shirts immaculately pressed in his bottom drawer . What annoyed the dresser the most is Sandy ' s lack of pants . Sandy didn ' t own any pants so he never wore any because he was afraid of getting them all wrinkled .
