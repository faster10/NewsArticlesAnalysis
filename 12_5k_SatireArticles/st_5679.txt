" For 16 months , we ' ve painstakingly conducted a battery of tests using every conceivable variety of pants , and we still haven ' t determined how the same man could fit into slacks with a waist of 32 as well as trousers in 33 , " said Nolan , confirming that the two differently sized pants were neither too tight nor too loose on Holland , with both sitting comfortably about his waist without any need to be adjusted or periodically pulled up . " Our test subject is truly a scientific marvel . We ' ve held double blind clinical trials and somehow produced the same results time and time again . The 33 inch chinos from the Gap were even a little snug compared to 32 inch pleated Dockers . "
