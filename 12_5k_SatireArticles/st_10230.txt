When asked if he considers himself a spoiler , Ron Paul said , " I just want to get government off our backs . People should be free to live their lives as they think best . Politicians can ' t " improve " society without stealing from it ' s productive members . Politicians produce nothing of their own . Their " generosity " is conceived in theft , and nurtured in deceit . I just want people to live free . Our campaign is all about freedom , prosperity , and peace . "
