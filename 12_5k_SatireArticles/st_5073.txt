" Political cartoons run in nearly every newspaper , so they must be an important part of American discourse but damned if I can figure out what most of them are trying to say , " Lawler said .

' But the clerk at the desk was an eagle wearing a judge ' s robe and a sash that said ' mayor . ' So the clerk marrying the penguins was . . . a mayor ? Or a Supreme Court justice ? "
