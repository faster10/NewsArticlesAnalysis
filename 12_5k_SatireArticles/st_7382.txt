A worrying text message arrived last week by an anonymous member from the team in the jungle : " They are completely stressed out by us , they are even more stressed by any device that has a sound , light or an image . I think , they think , they ' re weapons of some sort . They are destroying all of our equipment . I ' ve managed to hide this phone . We are helpless in the jungle . Get us out of here . Please ! "
