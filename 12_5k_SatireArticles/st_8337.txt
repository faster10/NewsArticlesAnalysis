In continuing with his resolve to put a new face on the church , Pope Francis said athletes and sports figures have not been given the recognition they deserve from religious institutions . It is time the true worshipers were recognized , he said in an interview with the local newspaper . He cited as an example the ongoing FIFA World Cup Soccer championship . " Anyone who has been watching the games can see the fervent prayers of soccer players and fans , " the Pope said . " These are the people who keep the faith in god strong and the church alive . "
