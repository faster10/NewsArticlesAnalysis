" I ' m happy I was able to take part in such a revered tradition of my religion , but to be totally honest , I guess I thought it was going to be a bigger deal or something , " said Marikh , adding that he had always been eager to complete his religious duty to visit Mecca , but noted that , for him personally , the trip had been " kind of a letdown , actually . " " Before I came out here , all I ever heard was , ' Mecca will completely change you as a person ' and ' Becoming a hajji will bring you closer to Allah than you could ever imagine . ' Gotta say , though , that never really happened for me . It just kind of feels like I took a long trip some place far away . I ' m sort of tired , but that ' s about it . "
