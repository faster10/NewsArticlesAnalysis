Katzenberg , who nearly ruined Dizney Studios during his tenure there as CEO , has " high hopes , " he said , " for Traumworks . " We may be making only two pictures a year now , but they ' re going to be better than ever . To make sure they are as spectacular as anything we ' ve ever made before , I have hired M . Night Charlatan he will not only write the screenplays , but he will also direct the films ! We can ' t lose . "
