GETTING THROUGH IT Dr Andrea Herman , a University of Maryland psychiatrist and licensed grief counselor , has developed the following set of guidelines to help Americans get through the anniversary of the Sept . 11 terrorist attacks : Remember that you are not alone . An estimated 150 million people will be watching the three major networks . No one channel is the " right " one to watch . Find the programming that is best for you and believe in your choice . Look to your elders . Find comfort in the wisdom and guiding hand of experienced leaders like Dan Rather , Tom Brokaw , and Peter Jennings . Take a break . If non stop television coverage becomes overwhelming , you may need to get away by occasionally checking out a game show or sitcom rerun . Turn to your community for support . Tune into local news coverage , as well as national news programming . Seek out your peers . Get support from niche oriented networks with which you personally identify , such as BET , Lifetime , or MTV . If needed , seek therapy . There is no stigma attached to turning to a counselor like Dr Phil for help .
