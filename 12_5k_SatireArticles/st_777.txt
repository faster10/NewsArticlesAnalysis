Schaumburg resident Tom Berry , a clothing salesman who bought Bears tickets as soon after the fire as he could afford them , knows what the team means to the area . " People lost great great grandfathers in the fire . Great great great grandfathers lost children in that fire . I think unless you were there , you wouldn ' t understand , " Berry said . " You walk around downtown , look around at the historical sites of all that devastation , and it kind of brings you down . "
