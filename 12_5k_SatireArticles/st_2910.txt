" About two months ago , some alderwoman who was up for reelection was going door to door passing out leaflets , " Prohaska said . " I took one , thanked her , and closed the door as fast as I could . About 30 minutes later , I ' m backing the car out of the garage to wash it , and there ' s David talking to her on his porch . I go to get the hose , and when I come back , he ' s actually inviting her into his home . I was half done waxing when she finally came out . Either they had one hell of a quickie , or David cares deeply about local politics . Knowing him , it was definitely the latter . "
