He went on to say that " Syria ' s uncompromising stand on rioting has earned Mr Al Assad great respect in the international community . We hope to learn from his flexible and effective tactics , and apply them to the streets of Britain . Following Mr Al Assad ' s advice , I have authorised the Met to deploy tanks , snipers and helicopter gunships in troubled areas . Known rioters will have food , water and electricity denied , and any police refusing to support the government ' s line will be executed . "
