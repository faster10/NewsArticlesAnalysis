We passed along the memo on the M Ms to the caterer , unfortunately the person who was supposed to pick out the brown M Ms was color blind and they left many of the brown M Ms in the bowl . Why they didn ' t just order a single color or two defies logic , who has time to pick out one color of M Ms from a mix anyway ? "
