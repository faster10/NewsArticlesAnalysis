Tyolect , a defrocked Jesuit priest who always secretly fantasized annihilating the Sistine Chapel , was forced to leave the priesthood after it was found that he had an Uzi , an M 16 , an AK 47 , three fully automatic pistols , a Light Anti Tank Weapon , 500 pounds of nitrogen fertilizer , a grenade launcher , and a drone ( which he made himself using an ACME Kangaroo Corp . Drone kit ) in his spartan 6 foot by 8 foot room at Saint Michael the Archangel Jesuit Monastery in Yonkers .
