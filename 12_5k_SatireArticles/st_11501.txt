What does all this mean for India ? It means Wal Kart will become a giant mosquito that will drain the Indian economy of billions of dollars each year . It also means the Indian government will become extremely wealthy through Wal Kart and the Indian people will become slaves to Wal Kart owned industries in India . It will be impossible for Indians to get out of their subservient positions because Wal Kart ' s immense wealth won ' t allow local Indian business people to buy wholesale at a lower price than Wal Kart . As Wal Kart starts injecting low priced technologies into India , the consumers will become dependent on Wal Kart , allowing Wal Kart to keep a tighter grip on the Indian economy . This was seen in the Middle Ages between serfs and their landlords . Serfdom is the Middle Ages was a socio economic status of unfree peasants under feudalism , and specifically relates to Manorialism . It was a condition of bondage or modified slavery which developed primarily during the High Middle Ages in Europe . Serfdom was the enforced labor of serfs on the fields of landowners , in return for protection and the right to work on their leased fields . The new Indian serfdom will be defined as Indian merchants and workers unable to generate enough investment capital to compete with Wal kart and being forced to work as labors in Wal kart owned businesses for the next several thousand years . Wal Kart will rake in trillions of dollars of which they will share a small amount with the Indian government , local farmers and local manufactures . Indian consumers of Wal Kart will be the instruments of their own destruction when they discover that they themselves will never be able to own any type of business in India and their children will be forced to work as laborers just to have enough money to eat .
