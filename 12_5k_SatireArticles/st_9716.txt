I have no qualms about the headline or calling McCain a low life scum . Any political confidence man who breaks treaty rights , along with fellow Arizona legislation stuffer Republican and U . S . Rep . Paul Gosar who is just as guilty as McCain for this federal piracy of sovereign tribal lands and Gosar , along with McCain , should be booted out of Congress for this land theft collusion . And these con men McCain and Gosar stomped all over a sovereign First Nation ' s empowerment to maintain their lands . McCain and Gosar YOU ' RE BOTH LOW LIFE SCUM ! ! ! The fact that you both worked together in sticking add ons into Defense bills which have nothing at all to do with copper mining or a land swap deal is criminal . Hell , it ' s nothing short of larceny !
