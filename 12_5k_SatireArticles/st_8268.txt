On top of the ermine fur that is clipped short , the real secret of the invention stands out . Literally . " When we developed Canofab , we tried some odd combinations , mainly for fun . It gets mighty boring with no sunlight all winter in NWT . So we grabbed some golf balls , some Velcro , and little ermine that was snooping around in the garbage . When we duct taped all three of these things onto a manikin and tried them in a wind tunnel , we were shocked to learn that air resistance went almost to zero on our sensors . When we removed the Velcro , the air resistance went negative . It was like discovering the Holy Grail , " says Mr Ralph Bocce Balmer of Arctic College . The negative resistance is called " Canofabulous " by its inventors . It occurs due to a special aerodynamic lift akin to a superconducting electric current the lift causes more lift which causes cascading " superlift . "
