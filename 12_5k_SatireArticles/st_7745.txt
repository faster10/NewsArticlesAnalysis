Scooby ' s best friend and fellow gastronomist in crime Shaggy Rodgers , was stunned by the announcement and pulled no punches on his state of mind . " ZOINKS ! I can ' t believe Scoobs is going to this , " a tearful Shaggy squealed , " we ' ve been best buds forever . Now he ' s going to tie the knot . I don ' t know what I ' m going to do I may have to give Lassie a call and tell her to give me one more chance . I love Velma and all , but she ' s just going to treat him like a dog . He can do more than just sit , stay , and fetch she better treat him right ! Give me liberty or give me pizza pie . "
