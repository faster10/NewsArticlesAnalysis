" The puppet state ' s claims on the hag fish in our waters is crass and outrageous . It is the puppet state and the United State ' s desire to take away a means to increase our mighty nations virility and population . They are attempting to destroy our next mighty generation of revolutionary minded geniuses by blocking our access to hag fish mucus in our own waters . It is well known that the DPRK refutes the proposed borders of our waters as given by the puppet state and the foolish and ineffectual hovel that is the UN . Failure to recognize our proper borders and fishing rights will force us to respond violently in self defense of our potential glorious unborn . "
