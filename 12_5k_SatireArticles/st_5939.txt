" I don ' t care if people say he ' s chubby , " said Tippy ' s owner Katherine Mathers , gently scratching the dog ' s protruding belly . " So what if he doesn ' t look like the dog in the Iams commercial ? What ' s more important : having a perfect body or being happy ? I love him whether he ' s 25 , 50 , or even 150 pounds overweight . In fact , I think he ' s the cutest dog in the world . "
