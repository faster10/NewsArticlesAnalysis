This is far from the first instance in which the Supreme Court has been called upon to decide matters of the national pastime . In the 1903 case of Wagner v . The Chicago White Sox , the court ruled 5 4 in favor of the defendant that " a base ball hit far and high , only to bounce fairly onto the field of play , and then spring forth into the seats of the ' bleachers ' should earn the bats man no more and no fewer than two bases , and not an out . " A landmark 1976 ruling established the infield fly rule . And more recently , a 2006 decision in the case of Rodriguez v . The Fans of New York cemented the legal precedent established in the 1940 case of Williams v . The Fans of Boston , which made it clear that baseball fans are free to boo , no matter how nonsensical it may seem , players on their home team .
