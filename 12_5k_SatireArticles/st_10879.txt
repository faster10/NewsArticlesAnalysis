" Today , Catholicism is plagued by a ghoulish nightmare , " said Jo o Tinoco , Archbishop of Mariana , Brazil , addressing the media at a Monday press conference . " A nightmare of investigations , penetrating inquiries , and rapacious , probing violations of ecclesiastical privilege . Such horrors are not merely inappropriate , but utterly incompatible with a society that claims to be civilized . How long before the entire world stands up and says , ' No more ! No more investigations of child abuse ! ? ' Maybe a month . Maybe a year . But we shall ever fight until that day . "
