On questioning , a high ranking member of the USAF Bomber Command admitted that just one recently retired B52 bomber crew were probably responsible for these and hundreds of other undetonated bomb buried in the ground all over Iraq . " It seems that allowing a bomber to operate with a bomb handler suffering from amnesia and hence liable to forget to arm the bombs and a laser target bomb aimer later found to be addicted to the class A restricted Amphetamines supplied as standard to USAF flight crew was a mistake , in hindsight . " His aide added " That school was lucky at least in that case the bombs didn ' t go off . The real unlucky ones were when the bomb handler actually remembered to arm the bombs . " he chuckled , remembering the huge laughs he and his bomber command friends had watching the videos of the bombs all going every which way as they attempted to following the quivering laser target dot .
