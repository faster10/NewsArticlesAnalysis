Martian aliens have been the subject of racist jokes and are often referred to as " those damn Martians " . They crowd 600 to 700 hundred Martians into spacecraft designed to hold only 80 or 100 aliens . Once on the Jovian moons they stare at the local women , take jobs away from the locals at low wages , and crowd 200 to 300 aliens per geodesic domes designed to hold only 50 denizens . As soon as they move in the Jovian Satellitans are heard to say , " there goes the quasenhood . " One joke making the rounds goes like this , " Why doesn ' t Mars have an olympic team ? because every Martian that can teletransport , shoot a laser bow , or burrow through sand dunes has already left " .
