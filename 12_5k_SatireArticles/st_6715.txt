Shinseki said the new 200 , 000 square foot , windowless facility has been carefully designed to address all possible sitting and waiting needs of American veterans , as it will reportedly feature tasteful accent lighting , plentiful boxes of tissues , dozens of handsome framed prints of landscape paintings , a number of coffee tables , and a wide range of plants placed throughout the room . In a concerted effort to remedy problems that have been documented at other VA facilities , the secretary confirmed that the new location will keep on hand thousands of brand new clipboards and ballpoint pens to ensure that no veteran goes without the resources they need to fill out forms while they wait .
