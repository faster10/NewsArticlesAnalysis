" All I was trying to do was to get at son Kyle ' s old high school sweaters and sweatshirts , " said Marilyn , attempting to explain the incident . " They were under the Christmas decorations , so I had to move some boxes out from on top of them . Mrs Swanson said warm clothes were needed for the church charity drive , and Kyle doesn ' t fit into any of those old things anyway . I didn ' t think it would hurt the lawn mower any if I stacked the boxes there for just one second . I ' m sorry . "
