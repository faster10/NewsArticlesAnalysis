The Constitution of the United States is without a doubt the single greatest document in the history of mankind , codifying the fundamental principle of governmental power and authority being derived from and granted through the consent of the governed . Our Constitution established a system of governance that preserves , protects , and holds sacrosanct the individual rights and primacy of the governed as well as providing for the explicit protection of the governed from governmental tyranny and or oppression . We have witnessed the insidious and iniquitous effects of tyranny and oppression on people all over the world . We and our forebears have embodied and personified our organizational motto , De Oppresso Liber To Free the Oppressed , for more than a half century as we have fought , shed blood , and died in the pursuit of freedom for the oppressed .
