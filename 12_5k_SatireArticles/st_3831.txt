During the ceremony , the usually festive Churchill Downs was eerily quiet , with the only sounds in the building coming from the low rumble of muffled drums , the clacking of horses ' hooves , and a dirge like rendition of " My Old Kentucky Home " played in a minor key by the University of Louisville marching band . As they laid his casket on the bier , Elton John performed a special version of " Candle In The Wind " rewritten to describe Barbaro ' s tragically short life .
