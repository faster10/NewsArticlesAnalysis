Asked if this new legislation might cause problems for pedestrians , the Chief Minister answered that they would just have to be careful . He went on the say " Motorists pay to use the road , by paying licence and registration fees , whereas pedestrians don ' t contribute to the upkeep of the roads , so we are giving the motorists the benefit of spending their money . " " Pedestrians should stay off the roads , they are nothing but a nuisance to motorists , causing accidents and blocking the roads . " he added , " If they get hit by a car it ' s their own fault for going on the roadway . "
