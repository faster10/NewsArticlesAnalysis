However , not all hope is lost . Cox went on to announce that , " we will be performing a controlled experiment using one of Justin Bieber ' s hoodies and some false vampire teeth from Robert Pattinson , in a specially built research centre outside Geneva . If this experiment is successful then we will attempt to bring Bieber and Pattinson into a room together . Eventually , we may be able to show a short , silent Twilight film featuring Bieber to members of the public who have undertaken a series of training courses to teach them to deal with the situation .
