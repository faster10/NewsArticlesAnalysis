Dr Gibson , 67 , stood by his comments yesterday , to achieve this he had them enlarged and placed on a poster , and insisted that he had not meant to cause offence . " If you have a high frequency of genes with a predisposition to type 1 diabetes , then you have to ask why that is , " he said . " I am not talking about incest or anything like that . But it is the case that people in past generations did not move around so much and would have had relationships in their own communities . " Inbreeding is one of those things that nobody can talk about because it brings up images of mutants , much like the X men except uglier but that is not the case . Norfolk people are really no different to those in other areas of the country , just stupider and uglier . " My purpose in bringing this up is not to denigrate anyone but to try to understand why there is a high rate of diabetes among children in Norfolk . "
