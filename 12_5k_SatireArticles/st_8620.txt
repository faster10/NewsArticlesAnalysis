" We also thought of the Tampa Bay Bible Thumpers . We knew it would make all of the born agains in area happy , but were unsure about the Jews , Moslems , and Athiests . We figured that some stupid athiest with nothing better to do would probably sue us because the name was offensive . I mean , there is that moron in New Mexico that is trying to do that with one of their cities right now . We also thought that Disney might not let us use the name Thumper unless we sold them part of the team ( like the Anaheim Mighty Ducks ) . "
