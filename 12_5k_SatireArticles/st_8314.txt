It was an almost poetically fitting conclusion to the first ( and presumably last ) America ' s Cup to be held on the west coast north of San Diego . AC34 has been beleaguered from the outset by a whole host of plagues of almost Biblical dimension : from grossly under predicted and over realized costs of everything from the boats to the venue to infrastructure to grossly over predicted and under realized public interest , thus attendance , and above ( or below ) all , thus revenue to a competitor ' s death to the worst ( ok , exposed ) cheating scandal in the Cup ' s long , storied , belabored , and frankly dull history and to the distractions of first a possible American war against Syria and then of the looming shutdown of the federal government .
