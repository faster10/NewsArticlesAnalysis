Special assistant J . P . Ricciardi said there were " escape clauses " in the original language of the deal , but that they were too drastic even for a New York City executive . " Instead of the entire starting line up being destroyed , we could have sacrificed some souls . Lu Lucifer as you know him was really keen on the souls of some greats from the past . He ' s a huge Mets fan and baseball in general . He was very keen on Tom Seaver , but he would have settled for Keith Hernandez and some prospects . Seaver would have taken one for the team as always , but his wife was very vocal about him not sacrificing his soul . With Hernandez , there was some conflict of interest according to Lu . I guess they did some business together in the ' 80 ' s . "
