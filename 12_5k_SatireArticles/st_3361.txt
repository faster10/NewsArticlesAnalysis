According to photographs surfacing from the dig site , the terra cotta Mouseketeers are arranged according to rank , from Annette to Cubby , and appear to be marching or tap dancing in place . On the walls of the tomb , archaeologists have discovered a large fresco that depicts thousands of the mouse eared foot soldiers bowing before what appears to be a large reptilian figure wearing a crown . The apparent king is shown seated upon a throne of skulls and bears a striking resemblance to Walt Disney .
