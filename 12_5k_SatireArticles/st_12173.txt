MICHELLE MALKIN : Well , it ' s quite a nasty little self serving circus in the Beltway , and of course it ' s rife with double standards , particularly when it comes to the tone , the tenor , and the lack of quality of arguments of Debbie Wasserman Schultz herself . When it comes to the quality of her arguments , she ' s nothing more than Alan Grayson in heels , and when it comes to the tone of her rhetoric , she ' s nothing more than Anthony Weiner , only an octave higher . This is a woman who was just recently accusing the Republican party of sending America back to the Jim Crow era , and you didn ' t hear all the civility police demanding that she rachet down her rhetoric and make America ' s children proud . Remember that it was just mere months ago that President Obama was wagging his finger at all of us and asking us to make sure that we were making future generations proud with the quality and tone of our debates .
