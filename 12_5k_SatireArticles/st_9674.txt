" Our next big undertaking , " says the Eyegouge Cartel transporter Alex Chophand , " will be to send a lot of old people up to the border begging to be let in . We will especially recruit a lot of cripples and infirm people . When they are let in they will be such a burden on the American medical system that it will bring Obamacare crashing down and with that the whole American economy . Then we can take over ! The sicker the oldsters are the better ! We will plug up those crossing gates so bad they will need tankfuls of Draino to clear them out . We will make a bundle through all the confusion ! "
