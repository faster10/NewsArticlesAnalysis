" We originally thought quite highly of Young , who ran a seemingly complicated offense at Texas , " said Houston Texans general manager Charley Casserly . " He had all the tools needed to score well on a standardized test in this league . Vince ' s completion percentage got higher every year , he was good at picking up the blitzes , and his ability to organize an audible at the line of scrimmage was unequaled in college ball . But his inability to answer story problems , diagram sentences , and solve simple geometric equations makes us wonder if he ' s really as smart on the field as he ' s been playing . "
