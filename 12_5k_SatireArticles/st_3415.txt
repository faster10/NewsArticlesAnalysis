" Last week , I noticed a Kid Rock CD on Anders ' shelf , and I was like , ' Anders , you own a Kid Rock CD ? " Caras said . " Well , I got this 20 minute saga about how he bought it for his little brother , who ' s into that kind of rap metal junk , but his brother already had it , so he was going to return it . But then he ended up opening it , just to hear that one stupid ' Bawitdaba ' song that he heard on WTFX once not that he ever listens to that ' shitty ass corporate rock station , ' but he happened to be in a gas station when it came on and became ' entranced by its profound patheticness . ' "
