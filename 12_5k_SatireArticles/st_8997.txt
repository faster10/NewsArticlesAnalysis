" Primates have , I believe , conned you all . We protect them , and what do they do ? Nothing is what . Orangutans are better than most , though still rude and cretinous at times it ' s monkeys that really get me . They are lazy and stupid animals . Every day you hear someone talk about them , ooh monkeys can count to five . Wow , I can count to five , and no one ever mentions that . And they eat bananas all the time . They swing about the jungle , eating bananas . What ' s the point ? If I did that people would call me crazy , and yet they ' re supposedly intelligent . I say , if they think they ' re so great , let them fight it out in the real world . But they couldn ' t handle that could they , no chance . Then you ' d have the animal rights lobby on your back saying , oh no all these unemployed monkeys can ' t get work and I ' d say , yeah that ' s right they can ' t , bit harder in the real world isn ' t ? You can ' t swing about all picking fleas of each other in Britain , mate . You think a monkey could hold done a job in B Q , no it couldn ' t . "
