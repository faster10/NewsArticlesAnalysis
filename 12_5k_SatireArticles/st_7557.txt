Mary Kate was of course referring to the fact that the Olsens ' parents were more than willing to hand over their twin daughters to ABC at just a few weeks of age to be used for comic relief in a sitcom where Bob Saget , some idiot who did a Bullwinkle impression , and that guy who used to play Blackie on General Hospital were the main stars , just to make a few quick bucks . When the show ended of course , their parents actively encouraged the sisters to remain " marketable commodities " , a decision which has left them bereft of their humanity , but on the plus side has ensured that the girls will be billionaires by the time they turn 21 . Not only did the sheer heartless greed of their parents succeed far beyond anyone ' s expectations , it also turned the girls into masturbation fodder for millions of guys who couldn ' t wait until the babies they saw on TV grew their first pubic hairs ( an event that " experts " on the topic . . . or as I prefer to call them , seriously messed up individuals , believe occurred some time in late 1997 ) .
