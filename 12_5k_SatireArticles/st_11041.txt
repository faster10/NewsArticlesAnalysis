" Thank you , my devoted Brotherhood and friends . It was a good year . We not only created a global enemy out of thin air . . . we gave our invisible Frankenstein a cracking name . . . " Terrorism " . Boo ! ( Laughter ) . And planted it in the sheeple ' s minds until we have no further use for it . ( Pause ) . If the sheeple could think you might call that mind control . But we put an end to all that nonsense didn ' t we ? ( Laughter and applause ) .
