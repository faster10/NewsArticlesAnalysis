Tech companies appear to be the prime targets for unknown reasons . Perhaps the movie studios are not imaginative enough to see beyond LinkedIn ' s offer and it set a precedent , perhaps tech companies ' cash hordes are considered larger , or perhaps proximity to Hollywood plays a role . " Mark Zuckerberg and Sergey Brin definitely have the moolah , and we know Mark loves the movies given his reaction to ' The Social Network . ' I know Steven is trying right now to call him and Sheryl Sandberg to investigate opportunities to collaborate , including naming options . Sergey is tougher , and Google is not as easy as fit into movie name changes we might have to create a special vehicle for a name like that like ' The Googlers ' and have Paul Rudd and Jennifer Aniston meet on ' Google ' or something . And I ' m just thinking out loud here , but maybe Google and Facebook might have a price war over which website is used to get Paul and Jennifer to hook up , you know ? "
