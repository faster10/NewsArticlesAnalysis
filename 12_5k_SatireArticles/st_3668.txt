" It ' s nice to see that in today ' s media saturated , change obsessed world , there are still some places where tradition is valued and respected , " says Chris , growing contemplative as the Passing Of The Oui approaches . " In some ways , I hate to give it up it has served me well through these long , lonely years , a faithful companion in times of need . When there was no one else , my March ' 74 Oui was there for me . "
