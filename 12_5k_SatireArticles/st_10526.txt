" It ' s a classic case of ' guilty by association ' " , Fiorina said this morning , " when one vagina defends another they are both seen as one orifice . It ' s the machismo , patriarchal society that has given birth to this mentality , even though every vagina , including my own , is completely distinct from every other , at least in character . The media is out for blood , not just any kind of blood , but the blood of innocence . At least once a month I hear all kinds of smear campaigns directed towards this country ' s up and coming vaginas . This month , it ' s mine . "
