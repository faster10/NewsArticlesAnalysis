In a Mayo Clinic study of one hundred elderly pot smokers there was one revelation that surprised and stunned the small staff that conducted the study . The participants in the study were all volunteers , some of whom regularly smoked and a few who joined the study because they had heard the claims by the government seventy years ago that the " devils weed " could turn you into a maniacal sex fiend ! These few were the only participants who were disappointed in the outcome . All were 80 years old .
