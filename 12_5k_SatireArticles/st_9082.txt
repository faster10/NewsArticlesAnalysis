Somebody spilt a drink that left a puddle in the middle of the room , and it sent the place into meltdown . The bosses shut everything down : they turned off the music , turned up the lights , and locked the doors . They stood around debating which tissue paper to use to soak it up , all the while keeping us pinned against the walls at the edge of the room in a long line . After three hours the puddle was finally removed , but afterwards the music was only played at half the volume , and they ushered us through to the drinks table two at a time , with a full two minute gap between each departure from the line . They even called people who were planning to attend the party later in the evening to not bother travelling to the brewery as there was no point , they wouldn ' t get a drink in time . It was insane ! Everyone had sobered up by the time they had got back to the dancefloor no one was where they wanted to be .
