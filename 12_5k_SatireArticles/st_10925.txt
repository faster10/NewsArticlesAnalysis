The Fall 2007 fashion show is expected to bring in many of the worlds most wanted designers . For diehard fashion fans , the Paris Fashion Week is one of the most anticipated events of the year . It ' s also closed to the public , making it almost impossible for everyone but the well connected to al Qaeda who are expected to receive special invitations . Even the fanatics who staked out the World Trade Center can ' t find a way to tunnel in . The bottom line is that Fashion Week is invitation only , and only a lucky few can experience it from the front row .
