" We have also heard rumors that Mr Trump has attended our Dark Horse Training Seminars . This is completely false . Our seminars are held in Trump Tower and in the basement of one of his casinos , and on the 19th hole of three of his golf courses , but these seminars are not affiliated in any way with Mr Trump or his businesses . Although we have been friendly over the years , we feel like we don ' t know Donald Trump . He seems curiously different from all of our previous interactions , and thus we feel that his success in politics is an anomaly . He is an unknown . An enigma . We do not expect him to win any other political contests . And we certainly could not foresee his string of wins and his recent popularity . "
