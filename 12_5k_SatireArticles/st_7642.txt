The strongest and most often cited example in the statement of the alleged " douche slant " is the " Twilight " series of novels and movie franchise , in which teenaged characters and ageless vampires passing as teenagers engage in a variety of romantic entanglements and personality clashes . " This paper thin facsimile of " Dawson ' s Creek , " only with vampires playing the main roles , only furthers the stereotype of vampires as laconic , brooding shoe gazers who spend all day writing shitty poetry in between tortured feedings . Twilight , with its Gap ad vampires and overwrought teenage melodrama , completely misrepresents the vampire kind . If one of those kids let a real vampire get within five feet , their torso would look like a ham hock that someone pulled out of an alligator pen . "
