ALBANY , NY Kevin Ellis , a veteran " slider " with the U . S . Olympic skeleton team known throughout the sport as an outspoken skeletoning purist , has called for the recent drug and hype afflicted sport to return to its skeletoning roots . " Back in the day , just skeletoning was enough Skeletoning was its own reward , " said Ellis , who himself makes up an estimated 2 percent of skeletoners in North America , at a bar not far from U . S . skeleton team headquarters . " Just to be skeletoning down the mountain , just you alone with your skeleton , and then to walk back up the mountain so you could skeleton down again That ' s what skeletoning was all about . And it still should be . " Ellis ' statement captured the attention of Annette Fielding , the other skeletoner in the bar , and a group of skiers at a corner table who had decided to drink whenever Ellis said the word " skeleton .
