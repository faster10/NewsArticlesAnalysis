Several concerned parents voiced strong replies to Mr LaMotta ' s supposition that television , music and video games cannot be the common denominator for all of society ' s problems with violence . " He just doesn ' t get it . Everyone knows rock music , such as AC DC and Ozzy Osbourne is dangerous to children who are going through difficult emotional problems in their formative years " said Mr Tom Sheaher of Chicago , Illinois . " Just look at how women are portrayed in music videos or in video games it is apparent this is where kids get their ideas . " Mr Mike Fannehill of Anaheim , California also noted , " You watch a movie like " Seven " or like " Saw " and see violence and more violence . How are people supposed to act if that is what they see ? "
