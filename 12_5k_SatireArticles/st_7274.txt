" I get where ole ' Bats In The Belfry ' is coming from as regards the movies . They don ' t tell anything like the whole story . A lot of people think that it was me that finally pushed him over the edge , but he was as crazy as a March hare before I ever got involved . The truth is that all that supervillainy and superhero crimefighting crap came about at a very depressing time for all concerned . We all had our demons to fight with me it was bourbon and crystal meth . Sadly , ole Bats would take anything he could get his hands on . . . "
