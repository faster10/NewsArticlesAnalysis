" That whole Chicago area around Wrigley is decrepit and , if we ' re being honest , just plain ugly . Frankly , I just don ' t understand why we should hang on to the past , " said Cubs season ticket holder Mark Barger . " I ' ve never been a big fan of the skyline . We should get rid of it and put up some sleek , contemporary buildings that aren ' t so gaudy , something that doesn ' t look like it was built in a hurry in the late 1970s . "
