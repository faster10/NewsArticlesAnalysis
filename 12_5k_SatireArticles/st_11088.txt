With only 4 , 500 members of this species left in the world , even one of the monstrous horned beasts will be greatly missed in the ecological order of things . When the Homo Sapient ape is the only species left on this blue , green , and white globe , we ' re all going to realize how lonely and lonesome we really are without all those other critters around . Even being bitten by a mosquito or a wasp would be a welcome sign , if all other species , including insects , become extinct . Oh hell ' s bells , even they ' re all gone those pesky raccoons , possums , bats , snakes and rats ! They certainly wouldn ' t be pests anymore no , no , no sir ree they ' d be welcomed household guests ! But it ' s all too late . Everything ' s extinct except us . And we ' re all nothing but a bunch of assholes ! If you have the money and the clout these days , you can kill just about anything . And although it ' s a massive monster , the black rhino is at the very bottom of humankind ' s food chain . For a wealthy 1 percenter like Corey Knowlton , anyhow .
