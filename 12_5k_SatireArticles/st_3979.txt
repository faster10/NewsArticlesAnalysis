" You can tell a lot about a hurricane by its name that ' s why they have names , " Surfside resident Brenda Harrison said . " Mitch , strong and unpredictable . Katrina , devious and vengeful . Bob , good guy , just passing through . But this hurricane could be anything . It could be a gentle mist , or it could be the worst natural disaster in the history of mankind . It could strike anytime , and it could be anywhere even right behind you . Also , what if it doesn ' t even have an eye ? "
