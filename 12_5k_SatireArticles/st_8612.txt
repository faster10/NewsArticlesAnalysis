Timmy ' s one time co star , Eric Cartmen ( 17 ) , who is currently working in a McDonalds in Los Angeles , made no attempt to hide his contempt for the now scouse footballing legend to be . " He used to come round , eat my cheesy poofs and we ' d talk until dawn . Now , I don ' t hear from him for months . I made that boy into what he is and does he ever call me ? No . He ' s a scoucer now , through and through . Work shy layabout with no regard for their family or friends " .
