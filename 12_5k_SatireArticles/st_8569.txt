In his defence , Pavlos , 32 , now claims he was just looking to relieve himself , " I was only looking for the toilet " , he said , " I never once tried to sneak past security , in fact they were the ones that pointed me in the direction of the dressing room , I asked them where the toilet was and they pointed toward the England dressing room and told me " shit in there " , it didn ' t look right so I asked another security guard and he pointed to the same place and told me " they take the piss in there " , so I assumed it was right and just their translation for toilet " .
