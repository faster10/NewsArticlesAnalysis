At a recent medical conference held in Atlanta , Georgia , a consensus was reached that 83 of doctors didn ' t have a clue what cancer really was anyway while the other 17 were waiting to see if the health care reform would cover this question . After 25 minutes of an impressive show of jargon knowledge ( a common way for MD ' s to establish dominance within the group ) the resulting Alpha physician declared that the assembly should break off in groups of 4 5 and come up with at least 3 possible ways to cure cancer . Doctors were encouraged to work with doctors they didn ' t usually work with and assign their groups cool code names . From there the best two ideas would be taken and combined to make the new cure " doubly " good .
