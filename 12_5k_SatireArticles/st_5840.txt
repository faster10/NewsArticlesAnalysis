It ' s very easy to pass judgement from our ivory pulpits with our platinum gavels . We see a team finish 7 9 and we immediately think that they are somehow undeserving of entry into a tournament meant to find the very best team in football . We shout and we moan and we complain and we scratch our fat bellies and fart . Well not to throw you under the bus , but I do NOT think that way . And I think it ' s a travesty that some people do .
