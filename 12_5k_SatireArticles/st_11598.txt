" I never use cabs any more , only Uber , " said local graphic designer Sam Curtis , 29 . " Taxi cabs are all old and smelly , and the drivers are so rude . Plus , if a taxi cab I ' m riding in gets into a terrible accident , I ' d have to go through months of accident reports , insurance claims , and possibly even doctor mandated physiotherapy . With Uber , if I were in a catastrophic collision I would just get up and walk away no fuss no muss . "
