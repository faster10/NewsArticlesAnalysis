" I know I ' m better than this guy . Billy Whizz has travelled all over the world in record time , and my achievements have been well documented in the Beano . I ' ve got the comics to prove it . Why haven ' t I being given the recognition I deserve ? Probably because the Olympic committee have prevented me from competing in the games for years now . Apparently , since I ' m only a fictional comic book character and made of ink , I am ineligible to race with actual human beings who exist . It ' s blatant discrimination of the highest order . These ' head honchos ' are disgraceful anti inkers . "
