HISTORICAL NOTE : The Wikipedia story begins , as stories invariably do , in China ' s Guangdong Province in the 1750s , where ten year old Cantonese children were fastened inside wicker vases and forced to write articles . This is where the original name , Wicker Paedia , was born . The articles were exported throughout the civilised world on high quality China inked Chinese vellum paper and enjoyed by rich men in smoking jackets in brothels and opium dens everywhere . When eventually the articles were computerised and appeared on the internet , the name of the collection was corrupted into Wikipedia . As with so many things , modern usage has corrupted and obscured a colourful and authentic history .
