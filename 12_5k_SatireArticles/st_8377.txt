' There could be a very large ship leaving the UK by Christmas . It ' s a very long list and I know a lot of out of work English footballers and managers will be dead chuffed when the hear about our new policy . It could return footballing wages to the likes of the 40 ' s and 50 ' s instead of the exorbitant salaries commanded by these footballing illegals . I remember the good old days when weeks salary was ten and six and the players were entitled to play for England ' , said Mr Farage .
