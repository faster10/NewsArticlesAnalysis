A spokesman for the world ' s largest burger chain explained the reasons for this antagonistic new burger . He said ' We understand Morrissey is a devoted vegetarian and he is entitled to his opinions but accusing our company of being worse than a massacre in Norway in which seventy six innocent people lost their lives is ridiculous , so we thought we ' d bring out this burger in response . It ' s just a little light hearted fun and perhaps a little one up for the people of Norway . I ' m sure Mr Morrissey will see the funny side ' .
