" We saw an incredible parade there at Red Square yesterday , " said Mr Bush . " It really reminded me of Crawford , with all the people marching and all the red banners and whatnot . Really it was one of the best parades I ' ve seen . All the missiles and tanks really very impressive . I don ' t know how Vlad does it . I could use someone like that in my administration , you know ? I need someone to talk back to me sometimes . Someone on my own level . "
