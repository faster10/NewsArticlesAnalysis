As fires grow and spread , City officials are prepared for possible looting . In fact , the local chapter of the Black Panthers has scheduled a looting party for Tuesday morning at 9 : 00 a . m . A flyer being distributed by the group says that " Looters are expected to bring their own baseball bats and should limit themselves to two flat screen television sets each . Please also refrain from breaking more than three windows each to leave plenty of glass for other looters to smash in . Also remember to mark your vehicle with the looter tag so that it is not stolen or vandalized by other looters participating in the rioting and theft orgy . " Translations of this flyer are also being made available in Spanish , Jive , and ebonics .
