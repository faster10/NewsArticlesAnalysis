iDie Slitting your wrists used to be among the sloppiest forms of suicide . No more . At the touch of microswitch , iDie activates two razor sharp micro blades that make quick work of the blood vessels passing through your wrists . A built in pump handles the spillage , while iDie ' s memo recorder gives you five minutes of high fidelity audio that you can use to deliver your posthumous thoughts to the bastards who drove you to this . Or you can use it to play an appropriate tune . May we suggest Green Day ' s " Time of Your Life " ?
