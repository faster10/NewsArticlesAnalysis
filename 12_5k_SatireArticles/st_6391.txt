This American Life host and producer Ira Glass began work on the project in 1995 in Chicago , where he found himself inspired by and catering to an audience of professionals who dine out frequently and have a hard time getting angry . Glass and his team of producers , writers , and interns set about the exhausting task of gathering all available information on a range of subjects from minor skirmishes with the law to the rewards of occasionally talking to poor people . The raw data was then analyzed , deconstructed , reconstructed , re deconstructed , organized under a broad philosophical title , and interspliced with musical interludes by rock duo They Might Be Giants .
