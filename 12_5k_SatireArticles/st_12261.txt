A " man on the street " interview with Craig " Skippy " Thomas , a peep show custodian in San Francisco , revealed that " Mr Sandusky and his trial have been on my mind for months . I ' ll buy this product just to uphold his innocence and protect his rights . This man loved those boys and there was nothing like abuse involved . Just like my hero Michael Jackson , he showed them more love than even their parents would . I ' ll be proud to buy the first bottle of Jerry Tool sold in San Francisco , and will even use it with my lover Mark Lowton . "
