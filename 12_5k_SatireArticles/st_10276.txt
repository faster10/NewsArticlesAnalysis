Ol ' Cowboy Jeff ' s traumatic upbringing may have led to his becoming a biker sissy . His gay father left his mother when he was just a little kid . All he had to remind himself of his father was a heap of parts of a beat up old Indian motorcycle . Jeff locked himself in the garage at nights with the bike and after 4 years of learning everything he could about bikes he finally came out when he had it back together and it ' s now an enviable classic . " Most of my best friends are bikers , some with wives and families . Fine people who would give me the shirt of their back and . . . and then I wouldn ' t know the difference because we all wear the same black Harley shirts anyway to show off our individuality . Tee hee , sorry that was silly . "
