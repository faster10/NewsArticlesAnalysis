Just imagining the sin and depravity that would exist all around us if people went out in public with their same sex partners , or publicly celebrated that perverse aspect of who they are it ' s disgusting , and I ' m glad that ' s not the world we live in , " said Seattle resident Christine Smith , one of hundreds of millions of Americans who was touched by Phelps ' charisma and was won over by the influential worldview of his Westboro Baptist Church . " But thankfully , Fred Phelps opened everyone ' s eyes to the truth that homosexuality is a sin that God will vengefully punish , and we no longer have to deal with any of those vile people enjoying the same rights as you or me .
