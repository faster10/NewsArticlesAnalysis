A man thought to be " Lawyer " was spotted lurking outside Midlands Bank in Kensington , London , yesterday . It is not known what type of Lawyer he was . . . but all are dangerous . This one was heavily disguised in a pinstripe suit and carried an umbrella and briefcase . Witnesses said he was simply standing there pretending to read a newspaper but was apparently studying the reflections of possible prey in the bank window . One female witness said he was taking photographs and communicating with his pack by phone . She had to be sedated .
