The UN ' s Secretary General refused to comment on Kumanishar ' s complaints , stating that he " has better things to do than worry about how many pointy sticks equal how many boxes of Easy Mac . " He did go so far as to declare , however , that the UN is in no way responsible for the postage due on the aforementioned crate . " We didn ' t sign for the package , it was just left on our stoop . If Mr Kumanishar has a problem with the postage he should speak to Arab Express about their policies , not us . Perhaps if he had tasked one of his vaunted battle mules with delivering his garbage , he could have both saved on the postage and delivered one of his " highest tier " weapons . "
