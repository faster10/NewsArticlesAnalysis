" Teaching about Canadian slavery to our students was a difficult period during our school ' s history , " said Principal Dan Schrug of the Simcoe Elementary . " These lessons made students feel uncomfortable , unpatriotic and just plain sad . As educators , we had to act and abolish this unfortunate period in our history curriculum . So , the school ' s history teachers issued a decree on Black History Month that we would never again teach our children about how this country treated people like property based on their race . "
