" I spoke to the president of Iran yesterday and he told me he didn ' t do it . He asked me to send a message to Barack Obama , offering his condolences for the US having such a rotten ally in the Israelis . He went on to say that Obama had better stop libeling the great Nation of Iran or he would be really sorry . ' We be messin ' yu up , muddah fahkah ' " . Abahjinadad said this while making a hand and arm gesture familiar only to the citizens of New York .
