A new study by the New England School of women ' s Psychology Studies has confirmed what many sceptics have always believed . This study proves beyond a reasonable doubt that women are almost always , but not sometimes , psychologically deficient when it comes to communicating with men . The main theory of the study was to prove or disprove Dr Sheldon Cooper ' s assertion that " Bitches be Crazy . " Study of this theory failed to confirm " Bitches be crazy " but did confirm that they are not sane .
