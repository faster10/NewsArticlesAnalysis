" They ' re wanting to kill me , " he said to KTVT . " They ' re wanting to kill my children . They ' re wanting to skin us alive . " Very sad . I ' m appalled by such reaction to it all . I was young and stupid once , too , and did some things that were really deplorable . But I never killed an endangered black rhino . Now that I ' m older and perhaps , a little wiser , that ' s something I ' m keeping off my bucket list . So I ' ll just scream at Corey Knowlton yet again : Shame on you , Corey Knowlton , shame , shame , shame ! Have a nice life ! And I ' ll just let it go at that .
