Apparently Frank isn ' t the only one confused as to the origins of the term " cougar . " Internet lookups for " cougar " have increased 400 in the last six months , while alternate names for the cat such as " mountain lion , " " panther , " and " puma " have all remained relatively low , suggesting the animal had done nothing of particular interest to garner the increased activity . MILF on the other hand , or Mother I ' d Like to F k for those readers over the age of 25 , has also seen an increase in traffic as of late , a trend that doesn ' t appear to be showing signs of slowing down .
