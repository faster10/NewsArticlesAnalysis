Jeans aunt , Lotte Nockers , took us to another part of the farm so we can see the true emotional impact this new law has on the heard . This section of their cattle farm is reserved for all the cows who have already undergone the installation of the Cowtalytic converters . She explained why they have to keep them separated from the rest of the heard , " we do this to keep the personal insults from one cow to another at a minimum " . She stated that , " when we first started to do these installations we failed to keep them separated afterward , which was a mistake on our part . We know now how the criticism from other cows can cause bouts of deep bovine depression " .
