Not to be outdone , the Cruister ' s Hollywood namesake Tom Pranks filmed himself injecting a lethal cocktail of amphetamines and heroin into a vein . The potentially life ending mix , popularly known by the street name of speedball , has previously proved to be a deadly combination and is said to have been the cause of fatalities amongst even the most hardened of addicts . The usually sane actor , who is believed to follow an otherwise healthy lifestyle , posted a video of himself on Twatter and other social networking websites preparing and then shooting up the deadly narcotics cocktail and then projectile vomiting his recently consumed lunch before losing consciousness . His agent later told the watching world that the much loved megastar had yet to think of the best way to monetise the incident but once he has done so , would go on to decide which charities should benefit . He is scheduled to be released from hospital within the next several days and says apart from a slight headache and a dry mouth , he feels on top of the world .
