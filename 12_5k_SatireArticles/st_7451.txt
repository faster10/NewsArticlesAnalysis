Other classic paintings by Rockwell , who passed away in 1978 , that would be subject to re interpretation include the one of the little boy with his pants down in the doctor ' s office ( " That would be ideal for our Bettie Page feature , " noted Sion . ) and the one of the boys running in front of sign marked " No Swimming " . ( " That would be perfect for Rita Hayworth , Esther Williams and maybe Marilyn Monroe , " noted Sion . ) And in a nod to Playboy , a doctor resembling Hugh Hefner , the founder of Playboy , would have his stephoscope on the chest of a bunny being held by Cyd Charisse . ( " Or the gal may be a typical Playboy bunny , " Sion said . )
