" If a couple carves their names into a location of significant cultural or religious value , such as an ancient ruin or a site on the U . S . National Register of Historic Places , our data show that they will be together even longer and have an even deeper emotional and physical connection , " said Kingman , explaining that every couple they studied who had carved their names into some portion of a World Heritage Site had died simultaneously in each other ' s arms in their 90s after a lifetime of marital bliss . " We found that this phenomenon also applies to the size and visibility of the names themselves . Bigger , deeper , and darker carvings featuring full names are shown to prolong relationships upwards of 50 years longer than the national average , while tinier etchings that are composed of just initials and a plus ' sign extend a relationship by only a decade and a half .
