Mr Peddle told us , " He thinks we ' re all thick ? Haha ! He must ' ve forgotten the time I won his Christmas raffle . I ' d just lost a packet at his casino prior to the raffle and the wife told me that if I didn ' t have bad luck I ' d have no luck at all . I decided to show ' em both so I bought all the tickets . I wasn ' t gonna let the Mayor outwit me again . Eight grand it cost me but I bloody won that raffle ! That was skill , nothing to do with luck . That showed the Mayor and the bleedin ' missus . "
