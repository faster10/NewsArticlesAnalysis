The Honda Element was rolled out in 2004 to much fanfare as a vehicle that would suit the family and the adventurous type . They boasted about its easy to clean interior , its practical design and its ability to catre to a wide demographic . Sales at first were brisk , mainly from husbands who never ran the purchase decision by their wives , but fell sharply after consumers dubbed the car " butt ugly " and " The Legomobile " . An advertising campaign showing the Element as if it was built using Lego blocks had an impact on this name calling as well .
