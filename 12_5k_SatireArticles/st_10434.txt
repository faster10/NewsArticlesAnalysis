Mr Gore then went further stating that , " President Obama is not liberal enough on climate change spending . He is too focused on the US economy , health care reform and not enough on cap and trade . When I win , I can religiously attack global warming and climate change from the oval office . My first budget will cut almost every Federal government service to almost zero except entitlements , interest on the National Debt and to beef up global warming abatement initiatives and programs . We are going " green " even if it bankrupts the American taxpayers . I plan to raise taxes on everything from soda pop to brassieres to alleviate this climate change crisis .
