Sightings of Wheatchaffer ' s phantom have been scarce . Three checkout attendants reported the same mysteriously clad customer , but management dismissed the apparel described merely as that of Goths or Linkin Park esque rock wannabes . Yet bizarrely , every morning , a box of Kellogg ' s Crunchy Nut cereal has been unaccounted for in the cereals aisle , whilst an inexplicable milk puddle has re emerged in exactly the same place , no matter how many times it is wiped up . Customer complaints subsequently revealed that all the free toys in the cereal boxes had emerged disfigured and without heads . Countless other items steadily disappeared from the supermarket ' s shelves , prompting Branch Manager Bort Spudlington to label the phenomenon as " The Phantom of the Shopera " .
