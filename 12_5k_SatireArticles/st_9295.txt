In related news there has been a course change for the Olympic Flame as it passes through the Midwest on its way to the London Olympics . " We have decided to give runners longer breaks when nature calls . We will also have a ' safety torch stand ' ready at all times so the torch doesn ' t have to be set on the ground . Each ' safety torch stand ' is completely fireproof , being made of asbestos and coated with lead based paint . But we are really excited that our trek through the Midwest will be slower . Since London ' s weather is the wettest on record for 2012 , we decided to keep running through America ' s Furnace up until the day before the Olympics begin . We don ' t want rain putting out the torch , " says Olympic spokeswoman Carly Inferno .
