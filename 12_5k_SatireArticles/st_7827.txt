Derek ' s Auntie Barbara who was on the front row when the incident occurred also pointed the finger . " This is clearly an attempt at sabotage " she claimed . " I know Derren Brown is behind this . He just can ' t bear the fact that Derek has better , more informative ghosts than he has . " She also ' ripped into ' the sceptics " If you care to actually come and watch Derek at work and try your utmost and absolute best to make things ' fit ' then you ' ll see the proof for yourselves , it ' s just simple scientific paranormal activity .
