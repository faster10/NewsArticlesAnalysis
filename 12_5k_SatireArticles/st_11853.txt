Or perhaps you fear the sadistic jack booted fourteen year old thugs that prop up the " company store equipment rental ? To you I say " history favours the bold and ask : do you wish for your children , and your children ' s children , to live in a world in which twenty five hundred hard earned skee ball tickets can be exchanged for nothing but a crappy squishy head alien key chain or piece of shit laser pointer that doesn ' t even work ? For myself , I would rather they were strangled in their cribs .
