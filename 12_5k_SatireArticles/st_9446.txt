" Listen , if you put a gun to my head , I would have to say , no , nobody goes to heaven including me if you were to pull the trigger , " Snogawd says on the lo fi recording . " But for not heaven ' s sake , give me a break ! It ' s a possibility isn ' t it ? I would never have the audacity to tell somebody straight to their face that they are doomed to spend eternity in heaven unless they unbelieve , but I do think it ' s possible . It ' s really between them and not god . "
