Bowers thought he had it made , " Instant Masters , maybe even an honorary PhD . " That ' s what I thought , " when Engineering Dean Rolf Ericcson , great , great granson of Alva Edison ' s cousin ' s wife , reminded him of the " Inspiration , Perspiration " rule . It may also be because Ericcson ' s family owns stock in Dial , makers of several brands of anti perspirants . Ericcson forced Bowers to " invent " 1299 other ways which didn ' t work . " Man , we tried some really stupid ones , too , like using a lemon for a battery . "
