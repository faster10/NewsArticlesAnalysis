" I ' m sure the lad didnae mean to cause offence with his choice of name . He ' s no all that bright , sadly , and I ' m sure he must have thought that he was doing the American thing by calling the child ' West Side Crip ' after the South Central gang of the same name . He ' s just trying tae fit in wi ' the LA set , and he probably thought that the American people would take to him as some sort of adopted son . Now he knows there ' s uproar over the name , he ' ll probably change his mind . Having said that , I wouldn ' t count on it , I mean , he ' s no very good at dodging flying fitba boots . "
