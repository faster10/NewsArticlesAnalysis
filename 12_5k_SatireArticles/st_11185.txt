Albert Dawson related how his son had slapped his new wife on their honeymoon because she had turned on the TV when he ' d told her not to . " She fisted up and punched him dead in the nose , kicked him in the nut sack , too . " Says Albert . " She filed for divorce the next day and that stupid son of mine had the gall to call me up , crying his bloody eyes out and saying he didn ' t know what was going on , why she would leave him and that all he did was slap her one time . What a dingle berry . "
