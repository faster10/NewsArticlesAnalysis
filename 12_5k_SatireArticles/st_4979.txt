" If I could , I ' d tell the entire country about the message of salvation God has shared with me , " Thompson said . " With God ' s guidance , I ' ve become the wealthiest chicken feed wholesaler in the entire state . Maybe someday , I ' ll be famous enough to be on television . I sure do have a truckload of respect for people like President Bush , who aren ' t afraid to talk about how they ' ve come to know the Lord . If only I could proclaim my private faith to as many people as the president has , I know that God would be so proud of me . And , ultimately , that ' s who this is all about . "
