Joel , who was home in his house in Long Island , New York , had heard the news sometime later on TV . " I think this is as much a surprise to me as it is to everyone else , " says the Piano Man . " I ' m not sure how exactly to respond or react to this kind of news , but I ' m sure Elton John knows I consider him a close friend . " Joel went on to say " I ' ve never experienced any kind of sexual or homosexual relations with Elton , and I hope I never do . "
