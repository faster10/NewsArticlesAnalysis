Item ! Woody Allen has a new movie coming out . Word on it is that he has dipped into his past with Rutger Hauer to make a comedy action movie the way only Woody can ! Apparently , the story is based on a little mix up he and Rutger had with the mob in the early ' 70s . I haven ' t heard details yet , but you can be sure that it ' s hi larious ! Woody , that ' s what you get for marrying Frank Sinatra ' s wife !
