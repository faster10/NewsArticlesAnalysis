Simon Dowell 78 , the worst actor in Britain admitted this to be true , citing he played a bigger part in the auditions than the public realise . Simon is thought to date all the contestants beforehand , taking each one to a cheapo ' slap up ' meal and lap dancing club ' to break ' em in ' . " No one is a surprise to him when they walk on that stage " an insider said . " Do you think he would allow a bunch of talentless cranks on the stage to ruin his programme ? One or two maybe , not thousands of nope hopers , he ' d go bust ! "
