Garry also stated his interest in becoming a scoutmaster . He reckoned he had a lot to teach the boys about butterfly hunting out in the woods . He would have enjoyed teaching them special mounting techniques to catalogue their collections . How to pin them down without causing the creatures undue pain or distress . On the plus side , the rapid price rise of houses in the area is giving him a handsome profit . Garry also said he would forgive those nasty people who told such awful lies about him .
