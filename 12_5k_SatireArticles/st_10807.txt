Daffy Duck took the news with a different attitude . " Tweety ' s dead ? Let ' s see , he got 15 of all the cartoons , and I got 12 . With him dead now , I ought to get at least one or two more cartoons a year ! That means a new hot tub for me to enjoy with the chicks ! Wait a minute , did you say he died of bird flu ? Did he catch it on the lot ? Did he come to the studio any time when he was sick ? Do you guys have the antidote ? Sorry boys , interview over . I ' m heading north ! "
