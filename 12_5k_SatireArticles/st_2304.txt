" No one else in football has Brady ' s unique talents the physical gifts of build , height , arms , cheekbones , piercingly sultry field vision , the combination of arm strength and accuracy with a sense of tenderness , the combination of smirk and pout along with the intangibles and the ability to look good in everything , " said Tom Chiarella , who scouted and evaluated Brady for the September issue of Esquire . " It ' s impossible to estimate the impact of his loss , but it will almost certainly mean the loss of most female fans , many Boston area fans , fair weather fans , and the majority of mainstream media fans . The NFL is really looking at a worst case scenario here , one that it never wanted to happen : A football season that ' s only watched by actual football fans . "
