League commissioner David Stern scoffed at the risk of giving Bryant a team in light of his upcoming rape trial . " My lawyers say he ' s out in two max even if he does get time in the cooler . And in 2005 06 , he ' d be locked down while the rest of the league is locked out anyway , so it ' s really only a one year gamble . Speaking of gambling , didn ' t we let Jordan retire for two years instead of suspending him for gambling away the gross domestic product of Tanzania ? Kobe ' s got that same kind of marketing cachet the NBA ' s brand ' s association with narcissism and rampant lawlessness . "
