A lowly clerk working in the Department of Work and Pensions was today accused of murdering Margaret Thatcher this morning , following the revelation that the former Prime Minister died after reading a letter from the clerk informing the Baroness that ATOS healthcare had decided that she was " Fit for work " , and requesting that she should report to the nearest jobcentre for an immediate start on the work programme , probably stacking shelves in Poundland for at least 16 weeks of unpaid work . This is in line with government policy that Thatcher herself introduced in the 1980s when she put 200 , 000 miners out of work for no reason at all , other than the fact they got their hands dirty and had the nerve to ask for a fair day ' s pay .
