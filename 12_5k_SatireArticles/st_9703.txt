CC Sure Dave . The great citizens of Florida elected me this past November to protect their interests and it is my duty to do just that . Given the fact that the average age in the State of Florida is 70 years 2 months and 12 days , myself and my staff realized the only fair thing for the average voter would be to limit access to state funds , thus access to the state itself , to that sector . In otherwords if your under 70 , we really don ' t want you here . Think about it , no more drug problems , with the exception of viagra abuse ( heh heh ) . Funding for schools ? GONE ! Now that money can be used for truly productive projects , expanding the bingo halls , buying new shuffleboard equipment . Did you know Dave , that less than a year ago the City of Daytona Beach , Fl refused to rebuild the city owned shuffleboard courts citing a need for more money for the education system ! Where will it stop ?
