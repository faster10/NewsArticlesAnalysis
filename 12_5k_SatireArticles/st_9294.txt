Practically every county in Indiana , Ohio , Missouri , Arkansas , Tennessee , and Kansas have banned the torch . It now has to wind its way through back roads and unpopulated areas to keep it moving . The torch is part of a heated debate by lawmakers , activists , lawyers , and people who watch Gilligan ' s Island while cooking . However , the state of Illinois seems to be making friends with the torch ' s route planners . It even seems that President Obama ' s re election committee likes the torch , scheduling the President to appear at torch passing stations and having him give advice on how to carry the torch . " No , like this You need to hold it like this , " exclaims Mr Obama as he brings the light of the torch close to his face for a photo op as he beams a smile at the swarm of photographers vying to get their photo of Obama on the cover of Time .
