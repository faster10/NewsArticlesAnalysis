At approximately 10 : 20 a . m . , Dearden left the youths alone in the classroom , instructing them to work quietly on their " Thank God For . . . " posters while he went to the office to help Mrs Carlson change the ink in the ditto machine . When Dearden returned some six minutes later , the classroom was in chaos . Students were screaming and throwing markers , the felt board had been pulled off the wall , and the homework assignment on the chalkboard had been altered to read , " Thank God For . . . Going Home . "
