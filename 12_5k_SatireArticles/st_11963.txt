I ask you this : if you were stranded on a tropical island , and your calculator washed ashore ruined , how would you begin to plan your dramatic escape ? Slide rules do not cease to function when dropped in water ! I bet you never thought of that , you bumbling buffoon . How would you calculate the displacement of your raft , to ensure it stays afloat given the weight of the coconuts required to sustain your famished and broken personage ? What size should you make the sail to maximize thrust ? Today ' s engineer would not know where to begin .
