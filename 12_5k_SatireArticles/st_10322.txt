One week later Grandad called his friend to let him know that he did the dastardly deed and that he had watched from a window as the cat arrived and drank the milk , gasoline and all . He went on to say " It looked as though he didn ' t mind the gas as nothing much happened at first . " However , he then continued to say " Then quite suddenly , the cat stopped drinking the milk , gave a shudder or two , then jumped straight up into the air and took off like a rocket all around our yard . It ran up fences , over the shed , along the washing line and finished by going round in rapid circles until just as suddenly , it stopped and fell over onto its side and became still . "
