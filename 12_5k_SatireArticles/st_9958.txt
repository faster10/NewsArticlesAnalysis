Dr Dung Ho , of the San Diego Zoo , headed the study , which cost nearly 40 million dollars , funded by Federal money set aside to prevent the worst sorts of animal cruelty . " These beautiful , intelligent animals are weeping on the insides , " told Dr Dung Ho . " Every single time we show them the face of Donald Trump or Ted Cruz , they start beating their poor heads against the bars of their cages , while making noises that can only be described as long , sad , tortured moans ! It ' s really awful to watch them suffer like this . But we must ! "
