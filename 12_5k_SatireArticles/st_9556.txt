Under the new lottery system , every American citizen regardless of age , sex , race , sexual orientation , or occupation can be potentially chosen as part of a daily drawing of a random number of citizens , numbering at least three , but often many more , every single day of the week . The citizens will all be drawn from the same small geographic area within a twenty mile radius that itself is chosen daily by lottery . Federal agents will then pick up the draftees who will be taken to a mall , high school , movie theater , middle school , park , street corner , elementary school , factory , college , office building , amusement park , army base , navy base , gas station , hospital , library , convenience store , restaurant , arcade , casino , boardwalk , swimming pool , skating rink , beach , national monument , hotel , or virtually any space that attracts innocent people performing the rituals of daily life that attract the crazed killers into whose hands the NRA has placed weapons of mass destruction that most modern armies don ' t have access to . The draftees will then be asked to go about their routine until such time as said gun nut opens fire on the crowd . Surviving draftees will be encourage to attempt to escape and place panicked calls to the special dedicated 911 For Shootings Only line set up by the government .
