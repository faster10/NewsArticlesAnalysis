During this time , Grand Sultan Omar banned the delicacy sighting " nothing on this earth should taste so good " but the citizens of Weinerberg would not have it so they convinced Mr Bologna ' s ancestors to continue production but in a different form and a different name . That is when a cousin , Hans Von Hotdog , stepped to the plate . " this " said Van Bologna pointing to a door we approached " was a secret entrance at one time to the Hot dog factory .

" Congratulations to you both for uncovering our family secret , it is about time although what is time ? We don ' t know here in the Black forest as evidenced by the lack of clocks "
