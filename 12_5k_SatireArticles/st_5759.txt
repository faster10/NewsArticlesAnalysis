" Even though they ' d been up for years , no one ever really looked at the surveillance mirrors , " said reference desk librarian Joanne Paul . " But as we were walking around the place , I realized that the mirror in the corner closest to the reference section wasn ' t even angled correctly . I could see the tops of the shelves and part of the ceiling , but nothing else . I ' d never noticed it before , but what ' s the use of having the mirror if you can ' t see people who are up to no good ? "
