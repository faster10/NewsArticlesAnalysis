" Arresting criminals does not diminish evil , only the number of evil people , " the statement said . " We must battle evil itself ! If there were fewer evil people but the same amount of evil . there would be an evil surplus ! Evil . would be more accessible ! Great Gods ! That means arresting criminals could cause a backlash that would threaten the peace loving citizens of earth ! Evil people would multiply like like evil bunnies ! Time . . . running . . . out ! Must . stop evil ! "
