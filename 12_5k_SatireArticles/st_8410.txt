When Manning returned in 2012 after missing the entire 2011 season while recovering from neck surgery , no one was sure if he would still be a the same elite QB he was with the Colts . He came back because he knew he could still compete at the highest level . This was confirmed in 2013 when he passed for 5 , 477 yards and 55 touchdowns ( both league records ) . He returned last year and still threw for 4 , 727 yards and 39 touchdowns . So what ' s different in 2015 ? Manning is different .
