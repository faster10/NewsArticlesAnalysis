' Thirdly , I have to mention the elderly English passenger , Mrs Ethel Crumble . The fact is that Mrs Crumble sat next to the kangaroo throughout the flight without mentioning it to any of the flight attendants . The very fact that the passenger has not mentioned to a flight attendant that a kangaroo is sitting next to them is obviously going to result in the presumption that there isn ' t a kangaroo sitting next to the passenger . Quite frankly all of this could have been sorted out before the plane left the ground at Sydney if only Mrs Crumble had mentioned the presence of the kangaroo sitting on her row by the window when she boarded the plane and sat down in her seat . The silly old woman has to be as blind as a bat ! "
