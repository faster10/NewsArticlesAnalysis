Coke stressed that the new 30 liter bottle would not be merely a new size option , but will soon be the only size option . " We ' re phasing out the smaller cans and bottles , as well as two liter sizes , " Hertner said . " We ' re confident that people will take to the new 30 liter size . Besides , they won ' t have a choice . We own Minute Maid as well . Soon , all orange juice will only be available in 30 liter sizes . Fruitopia as well . We will buy controlling stock in every beverage company and force them to follow suit . We are very confident . Did I mention that we own a small nation ? If the people of this country don ' t like the newly sized product , we ' ll simply declare war . We will bury you . "
