When asked why they chose D . C . specifically Mr Goofieson said " D . C . gives the impression of being a feudal state surrounded by vast lands of lesser beings which matches the way we in the Disneylands feel . Plus they have control of everything in the country and total control is something that has always appealed . The U . S . Government also has no competition , and a lack of competition we like a lot . Remember when Pixar was beating our butt ? Not any more . "
