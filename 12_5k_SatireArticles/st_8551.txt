" The Manchester fans are not a problem for us , " said Milan spokesperson Bonano DelMonte . " It is the manager , Mister Ferguson who is the problem . We need our players to be protected from his naughty temper at all times . After all , if this man will attack his own team with teacups , hair driers and flying football boots , then we must ask ourselves what he would do to our players ? It is not a risk we are prepared to take . There will be netting between Mister Ferguson and our players at all times . "
