Ironically , the single death occurred shortly after a dress rehearsal of the Savannah , Georgia , production of the Nutcracker Ballet . Herr Drosselmeyer , a German migr , long sought by Israeli task forces for his alleged involvement in Nazi experiments with bad magic acts , was found washed up on shore , apparently gummed to death . This has led to speculation that more than one Great White Nutcracker is swimming the U . S . East Coast , including possibly an elderly specimen that has lost most if not all of its teeth .
