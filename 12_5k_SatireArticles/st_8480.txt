Incredible as it seems , Woolfgang , or Woolfy as he prefers to be known is a direct descendant of the N . A . S . A . Arachnoids Programme of the early ' sixties ' , which trained Wolf Spiders ( Family Lycosidae ) to carry out simple operational tasks in the zero gravity conditions of outer space . This training gave these pioneer Space Spiders extreme intelligence , and it is these incredible skills that the Ferrari Team has utilised to create the fantastic partnership of Ferrari , Schumacher , and Woolfy !
