After the last bit of confetti fell , spectators praised the parade ' s highlights , including a float , presented by local Little League team the Tigers that depicts a mother , sitting alone with her head down on a kitchen table , crying . The first place ribbon went to " Sodom and Gomorrah , " a miniature version of the two Biblical cities engulfed in flames . The float ' s designer , McPhee ' s Department Store window dresser Bruce Carlson , was not able to accept his prize , however , as he was away visiting an aunt in Lawrence , KS for the weekend .
