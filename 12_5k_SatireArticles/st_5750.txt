Those who attended Jewell ' s inauguration said the ceremony was surprisingly upbeat considering the previous day ' s tragic and admittedly peculiar incidents , which also included the deaths of Jewell ' s first 14 picks for vice president , all of whom happened to die in 14 consecutive unrelated hot air balloon accidents within the span of three hours . During the ceremony , Chief Justice John Roberts , who administered the presidential oath , noted the extraordinariness of the occasion . " Today is historic on two accounts , the first being that President Jewell is the first woman ever to preside in the Oval Office , " Roberts said . " But it ' s also historic because of how she attained this office : by default after everyone in line for the presidency before her was curiously wiped out at the same time , and in the same obscure , antiquated mode of transportation no less .
