Judge Back was furious that he had to re schedule , yet again , because of Michael ' s distracting wardrobe selection . It was reported that last week , when Michael was ordered to appear in court , he came dressed in Superman ' s cape , the original , which he had purchased from Christie ' s Auction House recently . The Judge told Michael , that if he really wanted to get his attention , he could show up in one of Liz Taylor ' s evening gowns . He said that every time Michael appears in court , it costs the city about 100 , 000 for added security and support staff . Judge Back also stated he would have to fine Michael , to cover these costs , if he chooses to come dressed inappropriately again and the proceedings had to be cancelled .
