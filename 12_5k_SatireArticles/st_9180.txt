Currently , we have too many highly paid people on staff that are redundant with the staff of Bain Capital . With Mr Romney joy at firing people , he ' s already passing out termination notices . We may hire some of them back at lower wages , on a part time basis so we don ' t have to pay them any benefits , thus stream lining the campaign process . Of course , we are also looking into outsourcing a lot of the work . Since China is already suffering from a labor shortage and Mexico would be a poor choice due to immigration issues within this country , we have decided that all outsourcing will go to Vietnam . While Romney was able to shirk that duty during the war , there are enough people there that learned and speak English from the American occupation , as well as many that still speak French from the days when it was known as French Indochina , will be beneficial for Romney to communicate his needs .
