" What we ' re seeing in Kevin ' s case is proof that the serious injury recovery rate in pro football is nowhere near as serious as people have come to believe , " Dr Robert Homburg , a neurosurgeon assigned to Everett ' s case by the National Football League , said while pointing at the wings he had drawn on Everett ' s spinal X rays . " Not only will Kevin be able to walk out of the hospital , he actually won ' t have to , as he will heal so completely that he will be better than he was before and will almost certainly be able to fly out unassisted .
