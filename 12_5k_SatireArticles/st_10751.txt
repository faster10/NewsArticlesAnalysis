" You mean there is oil in Iraq ? " Bush exclaimed . " My intelligence didn ' t tell me that there is any oil in Iraq . . . . " Political observers say they are not surprised George Bush can ' t find any oil in Iraq . When he had started his own oil company . . . Arbusto Oil . . . . in 1978 , he was apparently unable to find any oil in Texas . Thats why Arbusto ended up 3 million in debt before Bush was bailed out , and his company was swallowed up by Harken Energy Corp . With a track record like that , nobody is surprised Bush can ' t find any oil in Iraq .
