" Our earliest tests involved closely controlled scenarios such as having the driverless car back into a parked minivan , but they always failed immediately when the vehicle would mistakenly put on its hazard lights and wait for the other driver to return , " said computer programmer Claire Durmont , adding that they eventually tweaked the algorithms so the vehicle would immediately drive off after colliding with another automobile or with a stationary object such as a pole or mailbox . " The day it finally left a huge dent in the side panel of another vehicle and just tore out of the parking lot in under three seconds , that ' s when we knew we were onto something . "
