According to the eyewitness , who claims to have been a " back seat driver " during the ordeal , " Kate was sorta upside down and had her legs hung out the roof of the vehicle and draped over the windshield when the accident occurred . " The snapping sound its something I ' ll never forget . But she was so high on coke , I don ' t think she felt a thing . Poor supermodel . They had to take a gun and put her down .
