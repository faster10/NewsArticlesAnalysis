DARE is an educational outreach program intended to help prevent the use of controlled drugs ( both legal and illegal ) , prevent kids from getting involved in gangs , and prevent violent behavior in general . DARE is a " demand side " program , meaning it works to keep people from wanting drugs or to be involved in gangs , rather than trying to fight the supply of drugs or to eliminate existing gangs . Participants in DARE primarily children in grades 5th through 12th , sign a pact that says they agree to not do drugs or join gangs .
