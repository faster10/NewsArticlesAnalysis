Creel says his awakening to the torments of Hell that await him after this life came after he and some fans trashed his motel room in Little Rock . Police were called , but luckily one of the two officers that showed up was familiar with the band and the other was a big Metallica fan , although he hadn ' t heard of Creel ' s band . But , in any case , the officers told the motel manager and the band to work it out among themselves . " So we agreed to pay the cost of fixing the place back up , and it was steep , like , 4 . 000 , or something , " said Creel . " That night I took a long , hard look at myself in the mirror and that ' s when I saw Him . "
