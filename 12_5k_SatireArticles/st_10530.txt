So , now we had a choice . Do Americans recognize the good that President Clinton brought to this country , or do they focus on the " Lewinsky " ? Do they elect a man that has both served in the United States senate and as Vice President for eight years ? Or do they elect a Texas Governor that has no U . S Government experience , has been fairly ( if not totally ) unsuccessful at every venture in his life , and whose name is very similar to the last President . Seems like a fairly simple choice , but it hardly was . Al Gore did win the popular vote in the country , however the popular vote doesn ' t matter . Why elect a leader of the free world based on total votes when you can determine it based on a system that is older than , well , almost anything . So it ' s over . Well after the whole Florida fiasco , it ' s over .
