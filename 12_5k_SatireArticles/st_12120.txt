He ' s a man ' s man , the kind of guy who likes to play poker , watch football , hunt white tailed deer , call turkeys , play golf , spend a few bucks at a strip club once in a blue moon , change his own oil and build things . He coaches baseball , soccer and football teams and doesn ' t ask for a penny . He ' s the kind of guy who can put an addition on his house with a couple of friends , weld a new bumper for his truck , design a factory , and maybe publish books . He can fill a train with 100 , 000 tons of coal and get it to the power plant on time so that you keep the lights on and never know what it took to flip that light switch .
