He ' s always just bursting into my room and yelling " cunt at me . Actually as I was typing the opening paragraph , he came into my room said " Whatchya up to cunt ? Getting ready for your date with the kleenex box ? I know it ' s just the way he is , but does he have to do it so aggressively ? Why can ' t when he tells me " Have a nice day ya cunt it have more of an upbeat tone ? Like when your mother sends you off to school .
