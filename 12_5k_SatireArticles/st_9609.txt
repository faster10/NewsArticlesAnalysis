Even the substandard University of Arizona , known for its pretentious students and lack of sportsmanship , has ranked higher than ASU according to the study . " Despite the exponential growth in diversity and enrollment , ASU is lacking in its ability to produce successful adults in the real world , " said Professor John Baker , an expertise in analytical comparative collegial studies . " These adolescents are zealous for all the wrong reasons . They retain hope that degrees will be golden tickets into the dream job of their choice , when really their diplomas are nothing but a piece of paper representing four years of wasted determination and hard work , " said Baker . There is statistically a large difference in the happiness of students attending ASU and those who do not . ASU students are obviously the unhappiest people in the world after graduation . This may or may not be due to the fact that they must say goodbye to the university forever . ( Or at least until graduate school )
