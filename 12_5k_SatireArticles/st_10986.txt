" We Russians have much to offer our traditional comrade . We can provide the wonders ofRussian culture vodka , famous plays written at a time when our country still had some artistic freedom ( 1800 ' s ) , literature written by oppressed authors who the Premiers and Czars kept under their thumb , advisers for the new lands who will make sure everyone is properly indoctrinated in our way of doing things , lots of cabbage and , of course , endless amounts of military equipment to keep those evil western leaning Ukrainians at bay and off our new land . Oh , I forgotten to mention lots and lots of Kalashnikovs . "
