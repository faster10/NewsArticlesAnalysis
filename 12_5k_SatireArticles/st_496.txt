" A man who harbors a secret lust for women without any clothes on is not the kind of man we want coaching one of our teams , " said local Little League president Stephen Claussen , who has asked Geary not to return next season after 14 years of involvement . " I don ' t feel comfortable entrusting our town ' s children to that kind of a person . What if his presence somehow influences these kids , perverting their normal sexual growth and causing them to develop that same kind of aberrant interest in naked women later in life ? "
