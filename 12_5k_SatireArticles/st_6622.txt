Bred in Brazil at the Sao Paulo Animal Research Facility in the late ' 60s , Ctenocephalides canis africanus is a crossbreed of the common North American flea and an African variant that infests the tough hides of bull elephants . The Sao Paulo entomologists never meant to release the mutant fleas into the wild , but a 1974 fire at the lab led to the dangerous subspecies ' escape . In the past 30 years , Africanized fleas spread from Brazil to South and Central America and on to Mexico .
