I went to Walgreens quite a few times , such as to get shampoo and soap and things like that . Razors also too . Sometimes I would get some chips or Doritos as a treat . My neighbor also works there , at Walgreens , so I would also say " Hi ! " to him . That was alot of fun . I did quite a bit of laundry . I would also add in fabric softener sometimes . On days when I had extra time I would even pre treat any kind of stain on any of the clothes . That was exciting !
