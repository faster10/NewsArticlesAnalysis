" Dick Davidson ' s being a pansy over his pile of flaming cow pies really take the take , " one resident said . " For three months , all we ' ve been smelling is burning cow crap . People are getting sick . EPA agents are buzzing around all over town . They can ' t put it out with out with water , and there ' s not enough foam in the world to put out a three acre manure lagoon . You know , that money he could have gotten from that show ? He could have used that to pay someone to figure out a way to do something about it . "
