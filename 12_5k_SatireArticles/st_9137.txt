A reporter from the New York Times , Judith Miller , then asked Mr Quirky to discuss a letter to the Times editor from a retired schoolteacher , which had caused quite a stir in literary circles . Mr Quirky rolled his eyes and said , " The Times has about a million readers . That was only one letter from one subscriber . I don ' t think it is reasonable to demand a recall of my Venus novel , nor put a disclaimer sticker on every unsold book . That schoolteacher should go out more . "
