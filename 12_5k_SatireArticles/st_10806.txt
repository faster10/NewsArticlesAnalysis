Bugs Bunny , long the leader and most famous of the Warner Brothers group of cartoon stars , issued a statement to the press . " When I went to the hospital to visit before he passed away , I grabbed the guy coming out of the room and asked him " What ' s up , Doc ! " He told me that our little buddy just wasn ' t going to make it . I ' ll really miss the little guy . We ' ll have to find someone else willing to work with Sylvester . Tweety was the only one of us who didn ' t mind getting spit on . "
