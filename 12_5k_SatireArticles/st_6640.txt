" I ' ve seen the direction America has been headed in for a while , so when they gave me the opportunity to look for a new country while still receiving federal grant money for graduate school , I jumped on it , " said Chicago resident Mark Ipser , 32 , admitting that long before he was offered severance , he had been using a significant portion of his time in the U . S . to " scope out potential countries where he now plans to apply for citizenship . " I ' ve already got some promising leads in Europe those Scandinavian countries offer incredible health plans , and the vacation days don ' t hurt , either . And if all else fails , I can just take a quick residence opportunity in Central America while I look for more stable , long term citizenship somewhere else . "
