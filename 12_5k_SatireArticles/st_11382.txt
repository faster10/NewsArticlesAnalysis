This was reiterated by Northern Irelands Chief Police Constable , Sir Hugh Orde who warned that Irish republicans elements were ' hell bent ' on killing his officers . Just this weekend a 250lb landmine was found on the outskirts of Jonesborough Co Armagh , it was just yards from a kids playing field but fortunately failed to explode . The bomb was found by victims advocate William Frazer who said " As I drove close to Jonesborough I slowed down because of children riding their bicycles along the road and noticed a metal object in the hedge along the road side . I immediately suspected that it was a bomb packed into the keg with the mixture clear to see and the wires and detonator " . Its obvious that today ' s Irish republicans just don ' t have the expertise to carry out attacks on children and Police officers the way they used to so new blood must be brought into these terrorist organizations if they are to succeed .
