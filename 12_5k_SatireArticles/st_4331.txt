" I just couldn ' t stand it anymore , " said Haller ' s sister , Deborah Barkum , who lives in nearby Edgewater . " I ' d get frantic phone calls in the middle of the night about some meaningless comment her boss made . She ' d drop by for dinner , and I ' d spend six hours listening to her go on about how she has to find a new apartment because the landlord refuses to do anything about the dogs down the hall . I finally made a rule : I ' ll talk to her on weekends , but that ' s it . "
