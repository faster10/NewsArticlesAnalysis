" We only have one holiday Thanksgiving , of course which is exclusively structured around gorging ourselves , " says Health Specialist Les Rump . " Unless , of course , you count the chocolate and candy on Valentine ' s Day , and the all the candy on Halloween , and cookouts on Memorial Day , Independence Day , and Labor Day , and drinking on St . Patrick ' s Day , and drinking on New Year ' s Eve . But that still leaves the whole month of April , unless you have a birthday and then of course you have to eat a lot of cake . . . at least we ' re pretty healthy in June , unless you graduate or get married because then you ' ll probably drink a lot and eat a lot . But besides that we ' re not a country that focuses much on food or drink at all . "
