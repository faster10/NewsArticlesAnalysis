Hillary Clinton has had an unhealthy relationship with her candidacy for a long time , according to Dr Limons of the University of Princeton . " She ' s always been this abuser . She has a horrendous temper , and has publicly beaten her own candidacy for a long time . The tragic thing is that she thinks she ' s helping her candidacy . You could see that clearly on Tuesday night , it ' s why her beatings were so strong . It ' s unbelievable that for as public as this was no one ever told her what she was doing . "
