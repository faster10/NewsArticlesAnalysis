Troglodyte Politicus is an unusually tough creature and while in other species this might attract a degree of grudging admiration , the fact of the matter is , it is just too stupid to know when to die . So it is found throughout the world , even in the most inhospitable climates and is very difficult to get rid of . Fortunately , its stupidity means that although it surfaces from time to time it is just too stupid to flourish and for the most part it goes away again , unlamented .
