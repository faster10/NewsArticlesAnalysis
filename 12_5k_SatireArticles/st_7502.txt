' Joey ' , fronted by sexy ' funnyman ' Matt LeBlanc , was the only spin off series from the show due to LeBlanc ' s relatively low , 12 hr fee . The show was a flop , garnering lower ratings than NBC ' s niche program ' Celebrity Decorating Tips ' a do it yourself program featuring handy tips from popular celebrities . The show received 10m viewers for its most popular episode " Watching paint dry with Jay Leno " , totally shadowing Joey ' s 100k average .
