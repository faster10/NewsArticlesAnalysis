When Councillor Judas finally passed away there was a bronze statue made of him and erected outside Solomon ' s temple . A national day of mourning was declared and a sacrificial burnt goat offering made at the foot of his statue . The inscription read " To the memory of Judas Iscariot , true servant of the people and their beloved spokesman . Always loyal and true who fought our battles for us to the bitter end . A man who always knew the right thing to do and did it with great courage and conviction . He will be dearly missed . We are forever in his debt . "
