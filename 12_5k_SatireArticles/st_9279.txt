So these guys went apeshit , and who can blame them ? They the four were about as popular down here as a Canadian quarter at the Horseshoe Casino ! That wasn ' t an arrest , that was protective custody and not a moment too soon , either . They had this bullshit story about gold plates or something , ' that would prove everything ' , they kept screaming . But while these kids , and they looked like typical asshole millennials to me , anyway , while I ' m trying to question them and they ' re trying to talk to me , here ' s 80 other guys screaming away to throw the lot of them into the processor and be done with it . It ' s a good thing Billy and Hal Assistant And Deputy Superintendents were both on the schedule , otherwise it could have ended up like a scene from " Fargo " .
