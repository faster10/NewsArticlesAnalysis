The best thing about the new iPhone 6 is the status in society that it grants you . We rang at least twenty people by accident and normally this would result in bollockings and threats of law suits . However once we told them we ' d rang from a brand new iPhone 6 we were suddenly getting invited round for brunch and dinner ( but never tea ) . When we eventually got through to the only person in the world who truly loves us ( our therapist . Hi Sandy ! ) we told her we had a new iPhone and she praised us for " integrating " .
