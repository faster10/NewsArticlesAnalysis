An anonymous source related that it became " uncomfortable " working at the White House . " Visitors " would walk up to employees and ask questions like " have you prepared for an IRS audit over a million dollars of unreported income from selling a bridge in New York ? " Another comment would be something like " it would be a shame if your all your tropical fish ran away to Minnesota . " A White House guest might look at an office picture and say " Bahamas . . . I guess someone might get deported if they didn ' t have all their papers in order . " As the source said , " it was REALLY creepy . "
