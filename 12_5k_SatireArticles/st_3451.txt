" There ' s no way I ' m gonna miss Burning Man next year , " Kelso said of the annual week long gathering in Nevada ' s Black Rock Desert , held Aug . 31 Sept . 7 this year . " It ' s the coolest thing ever , man I heard from this guy that all these naked chicks dance around in silver body paint , and there ' s this 50 foot floating couch that has lasers coming out of it . It ' s like this whole alternative community . "
