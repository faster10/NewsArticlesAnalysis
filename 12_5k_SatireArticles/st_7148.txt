" Yes , I know that guy in that picture well . He was once a very good guitar player . One of the best , if not THE BEST . He ' s so rusty these days I doubt that he could even pick " Mary Had a Little Lamb " and it ' s all because of his fetish and obsession with machine guns . He hasn ' t played an electric guitar in years . These days , he only carries around a machine gun . I don ' t think he ' s riddled anyone with those pointy tipped projectiles from one of his horrid lead spitters yet , but I know he dreams of doing such a thing , " said Tommy " Tom Tom " Duckworthy , a Dallas disc jockey who has a popular morning radio show in Dallas .
