Passengers also took photos of a NOAA P 3 Orion Hurricane Hunter Plane which is powered by four huge turbo prop engines and has a long electronics instrument boom which protrudes from the forward end of the plane ' s fuselage . The plane had just emerged from the eyewall and into the calm of the eye . The passengers cheered and raised toasts and did high fives at the sudden and dramatic appearance of the plane just 400 feet above their heads . The crew inside , clearly visible , waved back !
