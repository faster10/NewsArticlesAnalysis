" This deal is good for government and voters , " said Hilton . " I ' m changing the name of the place to The Hilton Rock . We will cater to only the upper crust of criminals . Each suite of cells will have premium cable but no DVD player . Hot tubs will be small . No saunas . Room service will be closed at precisely 11pm every night . New sheets only every other day . Believe me , The Hilton Rock will seem every bit a prison to the kind of guests we will be hosting . "
