" We called our friend Jack Puller , but he didn ' t know what to say , " Lowery said . " He said there ' s a market for antique toys and old dishware , but he didn ' t know the value of any of the specific things I named . He didn ' t have any advice at all on the plastic cookie jar shaped like a dog that barks when you open its head . And he just coughed when I asked him about the phone shaped like a football . "
