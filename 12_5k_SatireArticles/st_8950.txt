Mr Tezza McDermott , Assistant Manager , recalled : " To be honest Kev has been getting increasingly concerned about the lads ' defensive performances and their inability to take chances , plus the fact that he was convinced he was three inches shorter now than when he took over . Last week he was hanging upside down in the showers with two 20 kilo bags of gravel lashed to his shins and shouting the word " length " over and over . We were all a bit concerned . Mrs Grady from marketing had to be sedated . "
