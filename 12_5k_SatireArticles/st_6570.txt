Glickman urged America ' s farmers to seriously reexamine their priorities . " As the 21st century approaches , and breakthroughs in technology continue to make our lives easier , most citizens of our modern industrialized nation are out there living it up with their cable TV , video games and disco dance clubs , " he said . " Yet , somehow , we who make up the nation ' s agricultural base are still stuck rubbing our knuckles in dirt , praying for rain . It ' s a damn shame is what it is . I ' ve got to have half a mind to just say to hell with farming , and advise my constituency to catch a Greyhound bus out of their one horse towns and see what life is like in the big city for once .
