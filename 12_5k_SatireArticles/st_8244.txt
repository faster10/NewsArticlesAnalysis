Although Thornton is highly optimistic about the future , some have criticized his na vet . " He ' s going to see the whole country through green tinted spectacles " said one Irish American commentator . " He probably expects to find comical , drunken matchmakers , elegant protestant widows with wealth and long pedigrees , priests who love fishing and fights , large , overbearing squires with land and bad tempers , gossipy , nosey townspeople , and fiercely independent redheads who cling to old traditions such as dowries . He probably is even imagining accordion players who sing songs like " Wild Colonial Boy " in the pubs ! The simple truth , " the commentator continued , " is that he probably won ' t find any of that . Ireland won ' t be like he expects , and his friends should be getting him ready for a rude awakening " .
