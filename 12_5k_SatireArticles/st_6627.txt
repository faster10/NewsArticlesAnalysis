" What we ' re dealing with here is a simple but dangerous overpressure problem , " said James Soto , a federal fat dynamicist . " The tanks in question are reinforced , three bulkhead solid liquid fat scavenging designs made of roll tempered high tungsten steel , feeding off a centrifugal fat recovery slurry turbine . But some of them are over 30 years old , and we ' ve packed them with raw , semi solid human obesity by products at pressures nearing 13 fatmospheric units . That ' s 13 times the pressure found in the stomach region of your average 300 pound man . "
