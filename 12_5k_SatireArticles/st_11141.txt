The Rabbi had his favourites as well . . . too fond of John in my view , if you get my drift . And he was not as smart as people think he was . I mean he put me in charge of the money , and good money it was too in those days . How dumb was that do you think ? I mean . . . if you were God as you claimed to be . . . . . Come on ! Duh ? Enlightened ? Don ' t know what that means frankly and care even less . He liked to party , for sure and we had some great times with the shakers and movers around town and so on . . . but , needless to say , Jesus could not hold his drink .
