" Yup New Jersey in the 50 ' s was a fun place all right . We waited all year for daylight savings time so we could listen to the Lone Ranger in the daylight ! Popsicles were 5 cents , a chocolate ice cream on a stick was 7 cents , free if you let the funny little guy with the white coat and hat driving the jeep cop your joint for a feel . I think he was English he had a funny lisp and drank a bit ! "
