Now the question is who will be Mr Moore ' s running mate ? Will they stick with Cheney ? " Actually , " said a republican spokeswoman , " we aren ' t sure who his running mate will be . We don ' t want it to be Cheney . They just don ' t look good together . We have been thinking about Dr Phil , Ken Lay , Bill Cosby , and Steve Rauschenberger , who is currently the Illinois senator . They would all be great candidates . We are however leaning towards Phil . "
