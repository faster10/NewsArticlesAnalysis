Hillary Clinton , who spends most of her time flying between international airports , also recently refused to walk through a scanner , when her staff determined that , by entering a secret access code , a specially authorized operator , who is in an isolated viewing room , can unlock the blurring filters , and view an unadulterated presentation of the totally nude passengers , as they parade through the scanner . The specially authorized operator can impose additional filters by clicking on icons for " straight " , " gay " , or " strictly underage " , and select from a variety music to accompany the show . . . from cakewalk , hip hop , or heavy rock . . . played from an overhead speaker system .
