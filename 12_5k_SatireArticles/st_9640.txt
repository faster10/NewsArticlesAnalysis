Biblical scholar Bart Erhman , the author , among other works , of Lost Christianities and Misquoting Jesus , explains why in his new book Mary and Barry Sitting in a Tree : " Religions are highly competitive human constructs . Mithraism , the cult of Isis there were very few religions or cults back then that didn ' t include a virgin birth . Virgin births were all the rage back then . I ' m pretty sure Mary ' s not atypical teenage pregnancy was put to good use , over the centuries , to give the young and growing religion , Christianity , some street cred . "
