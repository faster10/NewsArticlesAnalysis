Another topic that was brought to the group was the issue of the growing trend of presenting magazine stories and even blatant advertising as news . Robert Greenblat , Chairman of NBC Universal TV Group answered , " Where is the harm in it ? " His opinion was " People aren ' t really interested in finding out information that is really useful to their every day lives they are just looking for distractions . For example : ask the average person the name of Beyonce and Jay Z ' s baby , and then ask them to name their state representative or if their taxes went up and why . I think my point is made . We are giving the public what they want . Isn ' t that our job ? "
