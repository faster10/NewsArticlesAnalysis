Last week , retired handyman Abel Rodriguez ' s remains , and those of his dog Muffin , were found in a hammock . They were entirly eaten except for their bones , Rodriguez ' s eye glasses , and pacemaker . Apparently , Rodriguez and Muffin were taking a short nap together before falling victim to a ravaging horde of Zombie Ants . Police estimate that over 17 billion ants devoured Rodriquez and Muffin in about 5 minutes . Police noted that Rodriquez ' s TV remote was still clenched in his hand but undisturbed . The TV was still tuned to the Animal Channel .
