French and Brazilian authorities said their first hint that the tragedy was caused by a plane crash came last week , when divers recovered several large metal fragments from Air France Flight 447 that were not fused together in one solid mass , as is typical of a functioning aircraft . The fragments were then analyzed and found not to be airborne or otherwise soaring intact across the sky . The final clue , they said , was that certain key features of the crash site in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean seemed to be consistent with a huge commercial airliner having crashed there .
