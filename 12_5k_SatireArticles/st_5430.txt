" Extensive testing of adults who grew up in homes without television showed that such adults had difficulty staring blankly at things for longer than a few seconds , " Center For Media Studies director Dr Edward DeGaetano said . " They frequently shifted their gaze and focus around the testing environment , often engaging others in the room in conversation and generally making a lot of disruptive noise and movement . Television enriched adults , however , could sit and look at anything : a spot on the ceiling , a fire alarm box , a stack of magazines on a table . "
