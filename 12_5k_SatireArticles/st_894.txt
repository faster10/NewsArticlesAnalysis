TUZLA It ' s no fun being stuck inside the house all weekend because your town is getting shelled . Especially when you ' re an energetic young girl who loves to play soccer and run relay races . So recently , when 11 year old Stadja Petrovic of Tuzla was cooped up in her basement for three whole days because of a massive Serb counterattack , she made the best of a potentially boring situation . . . She made a totally fun art project out of her mother ' s skull !
