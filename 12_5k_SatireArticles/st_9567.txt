A social environmental impact study of cost of candid yam sidedishes ( as compared to a baseline of sweetpotato casserole ) showed that candid yams have social costs of 6 . 6 billion per year in the U . S . alone . Obesity and its attendant medical woes , such as diabetes and heart disease , caused 1 . 6 billion of these costs . The bigger costs , heretofore unmeasured , related to domestic violence ( including number of police calls , days in jail and prison , and criminal court costs ) amounted to 2 . 2 billion per year . But , in a finding that surprised even the multi disciplinary research team , the costs of civil litigation amounted to 2 . 8 billion per year . Many of these costs had not been noted before as they are lagged , often by years , and so didn ' t appear in the more typical short term study .
