Needless to say , this got boring pretty quickly , so God , according to what Dr Elohim is now calling Ur Genesis 2 , " C aused the man to fall into a deep sleep and while he was sleeping , he took one of the man ' s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh . Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man , and he brought her to the man , who named her Eve . "
