Hilland , who is right handed , characterized the ideal punch as " quick and clean , " adding that he has no interest in throwing a " crazy " punch , such as an uppercut or a left hook . The husband and father of three also insisted that he is realistic in his expectations for the punch , and does not want to cause permanent damage or knock the victim out immediately . All he wants , Hillard said , is to throw the punch at an age when he will at least be able to " stun the guy a little . "
