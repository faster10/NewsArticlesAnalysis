Even with all his troubles , it was the Senate " Adrian " felt sorry for . " There are 435 of us in the House . There ' s only 100 in the Senate . That means they have to do over four times the amount of work we do to get the same result . Four times ! I just can ' t imagine . And when we have those joint sessions with us and the Senate . Well . Wow ! We ' re just packed in there like sardines ! "
