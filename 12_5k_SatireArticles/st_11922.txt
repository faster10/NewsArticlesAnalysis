There was like , maybe one that was kinda cute . With short black hair and a nose ring , she looked a little like a Fairuza Balk from The Craft ( 1996 ) , except she was a vampire , not a witch , and was older and unkempt Maybe it was Fairuza Balk Anyway , other than that , I don ' t care how supernatural their allure is up close , I ' ve come to realize it just wouldn ' t be worth it . Which is unfair , considering how much work male vampires put into their appearance . It takes time to always look dashing and sparkle like diamonds when exposed to UV light .
