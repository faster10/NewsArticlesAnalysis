" Muriel won ' t even open the curtains anymore , she says , because she knows the little bastard will be there glaring in . He ' s evil , pure evil . One time she walked to the shops to fetch some eggs , I like eggs , and when she returned she was covered in bird shit , but it wasn ' t just random dollops , it was shat into the word ' bitch ' . Well as you can imagine she was heartbroken . There will be a few phone calls in a day , no words , just heavy breathing , the breath would call about half a time a day . He would constantly make spiteful squawks aimed at Muriel whenever he saw her . Also on one occasion he took all the pepperoni off of a pizza that she had ordered from dominoes . "
