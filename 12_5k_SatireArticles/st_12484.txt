The Republicans are just trying to stand in the way , because the president is black . They even dared to question whether he was born in this country ! I think all this demonstrates that the Constitution needs to be amended when it comes to the qualifications for being president . Right now , it says that a person got to be 35 years old and a natural born citizen . Well , that is obviopusly unfair because there are a great many otherwise qualified people who cannot run for president because their mothers had to have a C section ! But because the Constitution was written a hundred years ago , nobody even thought of the descrimination that would result from a doctor having to deliver a baby in this unnatural way .
