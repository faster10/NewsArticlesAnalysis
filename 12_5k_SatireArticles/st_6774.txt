Thomason was killed while his partner was away on a bathroom break , a fact Fayhem said will forever haunt him . " I ' ll never forgive myself for taking that bathroom break . I left my partner all alone . I left him to read the previous night ' s David Letterman Top 10 List all by himself , without any backup , " he said , choking back tears . " I should ' ve been there for him . It should ' ve been me who took those bullets , not Bobby . "
