An epic four way fencing match broke out during the Women ' s Saber medal ceremony , with the archer taking on the three American women in a clash of blades that spilled out onto the balcony and across the Beijing rooftops . Germany ' s Ole Bischoff , winner in the Men ' s 81kg judo event , threw the archer through a nearby table and down a flight of stairs before his feet were nailed to the ground by arrows . And the Chinese women ' s gymnastics team was almost impossible for the archer to catch .
