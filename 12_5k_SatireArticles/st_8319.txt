' We now understand that our approach to the development of running , as a spectator sport , has been fundamentally flawed , ' conceded one senior coach , who did not wish to be named . ' We have consistently convinced ourselves that the 100m , 200m , 400m , 800m , 1500m , 5000m , 10000m , and longer , off track , competitions , are different events . In reality , they ' re the same event undertaken at different speeds over varying distances . Frankly , once you ' ve seen a few people running about , you ' ve seen them all , ' he concluded . ' Some athletes are in denial about this and have progressed to multiple marathons or even extreme running sometimes over hundreds of miles . On closer examination , however , all such events utilise the same basic principle of repeatedly putting one foot in front of another very much like walking , but a bit quicker . '
