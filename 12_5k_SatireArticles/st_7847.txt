Cruise Director Julie McCoy was also happy that the cruise had ended . " I got sick of these people ! Do you know how many games of shuffleboard and volleyball I organized ? Do you know how many times I wanted to take the skeet shooting rifles and turn them on the passengers ? If I have to listen to Charo do one more cuchi cuchi , I ' m finding me one of those guns . Gopher hid them away from me five years ago , or I would have used them ! "
