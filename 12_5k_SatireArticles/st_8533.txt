' He is pathetic ! ' , Ulrika rasped , showing a hint of her Viking forebears ' short temper , ' team after team he fails with , only a feeble publicity stunt is of any use for a team when Sven is around ! I laugh in the face of his tame management skills , I spit in the eye of his bland , waffling way of boring people to death at the press conferences ! I reveal my chest provocatively in his general direction , to show the clown what he is missing ! '
