" You know " the President began " Since I gave my Oval Office speech last Sunday , a lot of Republicans have been ah , you know , combative about it . Especially my call to ban the sale of guns to anyone on the No Fly List . That ' s just common sense . But these talk radio extremists keep crying like , " Is that constitutional ? Who ' s on that list ? How do you get on the list , or get off it ? ' Let me be clear . We do not need any trivial questions about legality or the constitution to distract us from what we need to do . The No Fly List was a good start , but we need to improve and expand on that with a No Drive List , a No Work list , and a No Walk List . And that ' s what I ' m doing with my latest executive order . I ' m calling it the List of Lists , and it ' s going to be the Bible of anti terror legislation . "
