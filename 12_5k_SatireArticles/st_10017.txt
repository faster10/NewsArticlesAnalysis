Backers of the initiative see a new and exciting opportunity . " We are enthusiastic about this EPA ruling because it shows us how the government can be a force for good . I look forward to walking past these demolished walls , looking into these formerly secretive bathrooms , and discovering new insights inside " says former Senator Larry Craig ( R Idaho ) from an airport in Minneapolis St . Paul , as he stops , mid sentence , to cry . Echoing Mr Craig , a group calling itself the People ' s Equal Restroom Voice of Urban Toronto ( PERVURT ) , a Canadian group , has called the EPA ' s decision " exciting " and " titillating . " PERVURT ' s spokesman Handover Seaman said , " Canadians are going to cross the border just to see these washrooms . PERVURT plans to organize a tour group just to see how this works , aye ! "
