Cast your mind back to 2001 and Al Qaeda were the name on everybodys lips . They were respected globally for their impeccable organisation skills and ability to pull off the most daring feats .

Then word started to reach us of Al Qaeda were being targeted for their lunch money by Al Shabaab , a group comprised mainly of Somalian cattle rapists . There seemed to be a new bully in the playground .
