Bruce Upmibut , of the American Family Values Association , also spoke up on behalf of the tobacco industry stating " There are also a lot of queers that smoke cigarettes , and our policy has long been that the only good queer is a dead queer " . The American Family Values Association is also a heavy contributor of funds to the Republican Party . Along these same lines , there is a bill before the Senate ( SB10666 ) to subsidize the tobacco industries advertising in magazines such as Out , Curve , House and Garden , Psychology Today and other publications that cater to the gay lifestyle . A similar bill has already been approved by the House .
