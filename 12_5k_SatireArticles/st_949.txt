" In perhaps the most controversial portion of the tapes , the so called ' chase ' scene , there is little doubt that Hill is acting with premeditated malicious intent , " said Kyle Dunkirk , one of the leaders in the legal battle for the tapes ' release . " Lasciviously chasing a trio of nurses across a tree lined field , Hill steps up his pursuit as the women become entangled in branches , causing them to lose progressively more and more layers of outerwear until they are clad only in brassieres , stockings , garters , and knickers . As the chase goes on , more and more people join in , including a man with one foot stuck in a bucket , a policeman covered in cake , and , eventually , even the outraged wives of the male pursuants . All the while , Hill remains relentless in his amorous pursuit , oblivious to the protests of all parties . "
