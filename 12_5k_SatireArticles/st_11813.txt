" I really wanted this year to resemble how the native Buffalonians live . With riding the bus back and forth to school , shopping for groceries at Topps , or having Buffalo wings at a sports bar , my schedule has been pretty hectic , " said the 20 year old Seneca College student majoring in Business Office Skills . " I ' d love to check out a Bills or Sabres game too , but I ' m not sure I ' ll have time with all the amazing stuff there is to do in Buffalo . "
