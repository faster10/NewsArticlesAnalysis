Fortune Adventure Travel , founded in late 1996 , attracted a mere 384 customers during its existence before Elmswick was forced to declare both the business and himself bankrupt this past December . Elmswick , who had no concrete vision of how to market his company , and what his target market would be , was told by all who knew of his plans to at least take some business classes while still in school , and seriously question whether entrepreneurship was something he was really cut out for . Elmswick reportedly rebuffed all objections with platitudes such as " You miss 100 of the shots you don ' t take " and " Nothing ventured , nothing gained " .
