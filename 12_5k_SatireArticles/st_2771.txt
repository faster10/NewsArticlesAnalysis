" This isn ' t an easy job , no sir , " said Arrow Trucking Company driver Wayne Crudup , 33 , of Lexington , KY . " Long hours , tougher regulations every year , and lots less money than you ' d like . Now , on top of that , I can ' t stop thinking of how that lady left that little home and that poor guy all alone , all because his eye went wanderin ' where it never shoulda been . The song starts going round and round in your head , and it gets a touch hard to see the road sometimes . "
