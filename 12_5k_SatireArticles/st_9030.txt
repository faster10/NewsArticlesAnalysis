One of the main greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) . As trees grow they take in CO2 from the air . When the wood dies the CO2 is returned to the air . Forest clearance and wood burning ( such as happens in tropical rain forests ) is increasing the latter half of the process , adding to the CO2 in the atmosphere . Deforestation is now out of control . For example in 1987 an area of the Amazon rain forest the size of Britain was burned , adding 500 million tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere . The loss of the forests also means that there are fewer trees to absorb CO2 . CO2 contributes about 50 to the greenhouse effect .
