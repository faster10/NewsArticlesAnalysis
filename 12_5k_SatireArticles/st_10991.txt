The first task set for the six contestants was to create a starter and main course for which they were given 5 hours and 22 Brazil Real for ingredients . However , as 22 Reals equates to approximately 5 . 90 , most contestants left the newly constructed studio , which claimed 17 lives during its construction , to raise more money before purchasing their ingredients . All participants were able to use their " Brazilian charm " on the streets to increase their individual budget , with some carrying out several programmes within the first of their five hours .
