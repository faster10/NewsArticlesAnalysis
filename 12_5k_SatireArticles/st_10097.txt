" That jerk ! " Said Sarah ' s mother , Clair Wilson , 65 . " He ' s just like every other guy . You ask a simple question and they either clam up , or make some smart mouthed remark they think won ' t get them in trouble . When will these idiots learn ? If a woman asks if she looks fat in something , don ' t tell her she doesn ' t because she knows she does and just wants you to say she doesn ' t so she can accuse you of really thinking she does when she knows that you think she does and you ' re a stinkin ' liar when you say she doesn ' t !
