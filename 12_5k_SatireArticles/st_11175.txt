The Liberal leader responded by pointing out what he called ' the flaws in the Labor argument ' . He said " The Liberal scheme will be free to all residents . No one will have to pay for the bins . " He added that the Labor government ' s scheme is only for ' a trial period ' , which means that they can cancel it whenever they wish . " Ours is a free permanent service . " he pointed out . " Also , residents will have a choice with our scheme . If they don ' t want to use the ' green ' bin then they don ' t have to . There won ' t be a law making it compulsory . " " People can just leave the bin in their garage , unused , if they don ' t want to use it . " he went on to say .
