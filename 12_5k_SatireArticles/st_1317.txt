" I ' m glad to hear they ruled out Karl Rove , " said Janet Manning , a nurse from Davenport , IA . " I ' d hate to have the scapegoat be someone highly placed . It should be someone of substantial position otherwise , he won ' t deflect enough blame but on the other hand , if they cast someone too close to Bush as the scapegoat , suspicion of the administration will be raised , rather than displaced . It would do more harm than good . "
