" There was a picture in the paper of Mom at one of her protests , and Mr Gemberling , my social studies teacher , brought it in to class and showed it to everybody as an example of ' someone making a genuine difference in the community , ' " Craig said . " So Doug Fritz yells from the back row , ' Dude , your mom ' s a dork , ' and the entire class cracked up . Why should I have to put up with this ? Can ' t mom wait until I ' m out of high school to do this shit ? "
