Assad hesitated for moment , then said " Oh , nothing so big as your dreams . But , with your support with air cover , why , I wouldn ' t mind finally taking over Lebanon . Except for U . S . Meddling that should have been mine long ago . " Assad gets dreamy for a moment . " Wouldn ' t it be nice if I could knock over Jordan ? That would be a real prize . Then I could barrelbomb all those refugee camps full with the traitor scum from here . I could even start to hassle Israel the way I always have Lebanon ! "
