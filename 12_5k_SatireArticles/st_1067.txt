" We all stand behind our Commander In Chief , " said Petty Officer 3rd Class Henry Williams , 23 , of Norfolk , VA . " When he started this war , President Bush called upon Americans to support its troops . Now , he ' s calling upon his troops to accept six month waits for hospital visits and pauper ' s funerals . In these times of economic crisis and uncertainty , it is our duty to stand behind our president , whether or not he is standing behind us . "
