To wake fans up and minimise sleeping in seats , a sight not good for TV companies selling advertising space abroad , pre game entertainment will be beefed up . Using the example of this year ' s FA Cup Final , as much meaningless noise will be created as possible by the hiring of music acts which must pass the new ' Thin Lizzy ' test where the sound they make must exceed eardrum splitting levels . Also , every blade of grass will be covered and used for other entertainments ranging from wiggling IPL style pom pom based dance acts , Police dog troupes to the Dagenham Girl Pipers brought back to perform , even though most of them are in their 70 ' s and dependent on a special form of Glucosomine mixed with particles of dust from the old Ford Motor Works seized after it was raised to the ground .
