The lads played all their hits , including " My Old Man ' s A Dustman " , " Does Your Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavour On The Bedpost Overnight " , " Laughing Policeman " , " Don ' t Laugh At Me , I ' m A Laughing Policeman All The Way To The Bank " and " I ' m A Pretentious Pretend Post Punk Laughing Policeman Just Back From The Bank " .
