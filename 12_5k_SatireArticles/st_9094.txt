Prime Minister David Cameron told Parliament several months ago that the UK had to " de radicalise " its universities . Speaking at a Conservative Mothers Union yesterday , he urged mothers of teenage children to " wash childrens mouths out with soap and water " the minute that they see evidence of " backchatting , strange musical tastes , opposition to conservative values and a belief in the tooth fairy . " . . . " That would be evidence of extreme drug use and it is known to lead to protests against governments which we don ' t want to fall victim to " , the Prime Minister told mothers . Interestingly , Samantha Cameron was in the audience observers noticed . It appears that Mr Cameron was priming her well before their household fell victim to the curse . Dr Watson agrees . " Prevention is better than cure at any angle and if students are impertinently bold enough to think that they can come to our university , then I ' m afraid that certain checks will have to be made . If they actually believe that the students union should survive and then they also take it amongst themselves to throw outrageous parties then we will have no alternative but to ask Dr David Starkey to monitor events . He will become our Events Manager , after all we don ' t want any history of problematic student behaviour . It will also afford Dr Starkey the opportunity to talk ten to the dozen , not allowing students the chance to speak , thereby averting questions and radical ideas and protest . Problem solved . Mr Richard ' s music will be banned along with Mr Presley ' s as that sort of music encourages students to " move it , to rock in a jail house , to become hound dogs and dare I say it , to cavort with paedophiles and their living dolls ? I suspect that we can also assume that they ' re live in dolls . The possibility really is intolerable . "
