Economists failed to predict that a formerly capitalistic country could so quickly regress to a feudal society . As one economist concedes , " I think our problem was that we pulled our mathematical models directly out of our hindquarters . I mean literally , I think I have a second brain in my rear end , like a dinosaur , because I wasn ' t really thinking when I came up with my rosy models and forecasts about how a capitalistic economy progresses to an optimal state of equilibrium in which everyone gets what they want . Instead , I reached inside my anus and pulled out not just the mathematical tools to disguise the counterfactuality of my assumptions , but the audacity to participate in that pseudoscience in the first place .
