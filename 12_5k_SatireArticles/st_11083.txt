Grade 12At the very end of their school year ( following prom ) , students will finally have the opportunity to relieve their built up questions on sexual education . In one short session , all of their questions will be answered until fully satisfied . This session will be carried out as a paired project , where students will share what they have learned thus far , and such that students can subsequently evaluate each other on their performance . This session will be the true test of the student ' s overall aptitude for matters related to sexual health . Failing this test may result in serious health consequences and may severely impede the students ' post secondary endeavours .
