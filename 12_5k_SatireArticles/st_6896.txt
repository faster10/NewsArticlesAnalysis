Lentz ' s passion for the actor manifested itself in several ways . If she caught a TV report on Farrell , she would quickly insert a tape into her VCR and record the remainder of the segment . If she saw that Farrell was scheduled as a guest on a late night talk show , she would stay up to watch the appearance . Lentz would also buy a magazine if Farrell was on the cover , and even attended an opening day showing of Daredevil , in spite of her aversion to most action movies .
