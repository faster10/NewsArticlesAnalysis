" No camouflage to make them virtually invisible to hunters ? No plated armor strong enough to withstand steel spears ? No nothing ? Let ' s be honest here : These dolphins had their chance , and they absolutely blew it , " said zoologist William Nagle , who explained how the cetaceans must have just screwed around for hundreds of millennia . " They had a 24 million year head start on us , and yet they didn ' t even figure out how to have more than one offspring at a time to increase the chances of more of their kind reaching sexual maturity and propagating the species . Given how fast their population dropped in the last few years , I wouldn ' t be surprised if these idiots died of sheer embarrassment . "
