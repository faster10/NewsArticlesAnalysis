A good person ? Do good people bite other people ? Do good people try to take a law enforcement officer ' s finger or thumb off with their incisors ? This biting alone , never mind the grocery list of other charges , sounds serious enough . It should be considered a flagrant crime . In fact , in other places it is , and Rex Gardner was sentenced to eight years in prison for biting a police officer ' s ear . This occurred in the U . K . , too , which has a history of shelling out less prison time for serious offenses than the USA does . And although the USA Today article doesn ' t get into detail about who this " officer " is whether or not he ( or she ) happens to be a sheriff ' s deputy an FBI agent on vacation a luck chasing , lost , and lonely RCMP wandering around south of ' the Great White North ' or a security guard at the casino , this " officer " was a representative of law and order at the time and moment he ( or she ) was bitten on the hand by Boynton .
