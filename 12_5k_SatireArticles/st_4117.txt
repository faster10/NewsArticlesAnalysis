" What those people have said about the gown is just plain wrong , " said visibly distraught Cincinnati resident Margaret Feinberg , referring to remarks from professional fashion critics who described the dress as " shapeless , " " unflattering , " and " not a good look for Ms . Theron , not at all . " " Some of the comments that I ' ve read about the gown are not just uncalled for , but deeply offensive to anyone with a conscience . This beautiful piece of clothing needs our support , and we won ' t rest until our voices are heard by every style columnist and celebrity tabloid editor in Hollywood . "
