Mr Montoya goes on to say that TSA ' s procedures catch accidental contraband all the time . " We constantly find weapons that were about to be carried on board a plane . Even frequent flyers forget a gun in their bag from time to time . No one wants an accident to happen on board a plane . Just last week , a TSA supervisor working the x ray machine spotted a famous Australian doctor known for his extensive work with poison antidotes . The screener caught a whiff of iocane on the man ' s clothes and immediately shut down the entire airport until the terminal was cleaned . Just one gram of iocane powder could have killed everyone in the airport . While we cannot comment on the case further , it is apparent that the Australian , Fezzik Humperdinck , inadvertently forgot he had the substance on his person . "
