" Most people don ' t enjoy weddings why would they ? " Giraldi said . " They have to sit around for long periods making uncomfortable small talk with people they barely know and will probably never see again . They ' re expected to help offset the great expense of the wedding by purchasing obligatory gifts arbitrarily chosen off some wedding registry gifts that reflect nothing about the giver . Plus , it generally eats up an entire day , if not a whole weekend , in cases where air travel is involved . "
