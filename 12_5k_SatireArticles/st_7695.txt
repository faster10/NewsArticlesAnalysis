" When we write songs , the overall content or message is of little concern . We mainly look for words that are easy to rhyme with like ' bat ' or ' here ' or ' day . ' You can rhyme almost anything with this words , and then we build sentences around that , " Monahan proudly declared . " And if you get to a word that doesn ' t have a rhyming match like ' catch , ' you just elongate the predominant vowel and it the word somehow rhymes with itself . It ' s genius really , " he concluded .
