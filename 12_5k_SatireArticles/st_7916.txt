" Sadly , with the growth of email , text messages , tweets , even something called efaxs which if you ask me is just a posher name for an email meant that gradually everyone started getting rid of their fax machines . Clive , who lives upstairs , and is a regular customer in the evenings , noticed the fax one day and we started a conversation . Turns out he was the editor of a monthly publication dedicated to everything happening in the world of fax machines , but they closed down 18 months ago and gave him the office fax as redundancy payment .
