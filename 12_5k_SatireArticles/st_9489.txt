He really deserves , not condemnation , but our sympathy . I urge him to get into surgery immediately . Being more rational , Inskeep in the future might be a TV success and get to interview Pope Francis . Of course , it might be noted , the Pontiff can be very persuasive . If Francis ' views on meeting the needs of " the least amongst us , " and the defects of the capitalist system , with its greed and arrogance , deeply affected Mr Inskeep he might not want to be a TV host like David Gregory , assuming that ' s Mr Inskeep ' s ambition . He might want to do honest work .
