Celtics guards Ray Allen and Paul Pierce said that when Garnett told his fellow teammates in January that he could get rim on a 10 foot hoop , both responded , " Yeah , right " and " No way . " The pair also responded " Okay , sure " and " Yeah , and ? " to Garnett ' s claim of hitting rim at the hoop at his house , citing as general knowledge that Garnett ' s home basket easily stands less than 10 feet and that his driveway is inclined just enough to give him an unfair advantage .
