An unrepentant Jane Pendergast , a Dial A Crowd veteran performer , told us " I thought it went well , my friend Daisy did a fantastic swoon manoeuvre , real hand to the forehead , semi faint . Classic . And my friend Derek managed to grab a piece of her jacket . I did think when the booking came through that it was odd to book a level 1 celebrity response unit for what is effectively a level 7 or 8 celebrity , at best ! But Cowell is famed for his arrogance , so we just took it as a booking and did our jobs ! "
