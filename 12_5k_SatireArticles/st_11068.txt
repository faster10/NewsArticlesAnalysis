" In view of the fact that we can no longer avoid or pretend that it is not there . . . the deplorable fact that runaway capitalism is destroying the planet even as we speak and perpetuating a profound and destructive collective delusion that we , as individuals and nations have become nothing but disposable objects to one another . . . a delusion that we seek to shamelessly propagate via by our so called ' culture ' . . . my administration , under my directive as your elected president , has begun proceedings whereby the creation and control of America ' s money supply , without which our physical survival is impossible , will be governed exclusively , not by self interested corporations , not by self perpetuating profiteering dynasties , nor by clandestine , financial organisations foreign to our shores that have no interests outside of the brutal exploitation of our people , . . but by the democratically elected government of this country ! For , it is clear to me that if we keep on doing what we have been doing we will keep on getting what we have been getting , . . more wars , more poverty , more delusional thinking and hence more sorrow , blood letting and grief for ourselves and our children . I cannot and will not allow this to happen ! We must begin afresh now . . . or rot in hell forever . I would expect this to be a gradual transition with the full backing of the banking fraternity and all institutions dependent on it . I have also decreed that anyone opposing this measure will be guilty of treason against the United States and dealt with by what remains of our lawful constitution . As your president , I can no longer permit myself to be a mere functionary of a greed driven ideology that I am unable to morally defend . I would urge all other countries in the world to do likewise . So help us God "
