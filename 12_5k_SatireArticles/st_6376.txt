" I ' ll never forget where I was on Sept . 11 , " said Veronica Coulier of Greenpoint , Brooklyn . " My sister and I attended an anniversary candlelight vigil in Union Square . The subway ride back to Brooklyn was eerily quiet , with everybody lost in silent reflection about what had happened the year before . I ' m not sure how I ' m going to spend this Wednesday , but wherever I am , the events of Sept . 11 , 2002 , will not be far from my mind . "
