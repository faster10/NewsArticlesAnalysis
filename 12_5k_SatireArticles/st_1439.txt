" It was very important to me that this movie remain relevant in the late ' 90s , " Kasdan said . " So I decided to go back and redo a number of scenes , using cutting edge computer effects to replace the characters ' hand wringing about the lost ideals of the ' 60s with hand wringing about their own approaching mortality . The characters ' new concerns have been seamlessly edited into the existing reels in a way that hopefully will serve to more profoundly re contextualize the picture for aging boomers , making it more relevant than ever .
