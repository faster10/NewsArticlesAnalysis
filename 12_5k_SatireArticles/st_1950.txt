ST . PETERSBURG , FL Tampa Bay Rays officials and Tropicana Field stadium management announced Wednesday night that , due to an unfortunate and unresolved scheduling conflict , the facility would continue to host the first ever Haunted House World Series . Executives apologized for Game 1 being repeatedly interrupted by shrill , gut wrenching screams emanating from the stadium ' s sound system , the players ' inability to field ground balls around the Infield Maze of Gore , and haunted house actor Rays third baseman Evan Longoria leaving every half inning to grab his Leatherface mask and chainsaw .
