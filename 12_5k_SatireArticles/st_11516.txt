The hypocrisy is outrages because the female double agents claim they were offended on three occasions . Why would a woman go back to the same man if she claims she was offended the first time then say she was offended a second time . By the first time they should have figured out something was wrong or they were enjoying the sex so much that they went back for more , a second time . The female double agent that engaged Assange , figured in her mind that the more contact she had with him the more culpable he would look without realizing that someone might bring up the issue of consent by desire because she returned a second time to him .
