All this makes for a very bad drunk in the long run when you ' re running low on juice and don ' t care because you had about a few dozen too many , so it wasn ' t any surprise when he started to ricochet around , mistaking a bus driver for a Marine and pushing him down a flight of stairs ( he landed flat on his fat BART butt , but he was okay ) and then , splashing that guy with his own drink . Just " for being a phony . "
