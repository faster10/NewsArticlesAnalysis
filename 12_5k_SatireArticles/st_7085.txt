Dr Lobsterapple says this symbol of gravitas is a sign of strength and part of the innate , stereotypical image of the heroic leader which is embedded in our subconscious . " The symbol works on an unconscious level , so there ' s little we can do to resist it . I ' m not surprised to learn about the Gravitas Jaws . A colleague of mine has a weak jawline , but whenever he displeases his wife he remedies the situation by donning a Halloween mask of Arnold Schwarzenegger and intoning in a deep voice , ' Forget whatever I did . Now go and fix me a sandwich ! ' Usually , she protests that he ' s being ridiculous even as she complies with his demand ! The power of this symbol is staggering . "
