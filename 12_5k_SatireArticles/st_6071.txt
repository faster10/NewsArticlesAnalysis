Passengers thus far have had mixed reactions to flying with Air Force One . " It was pretty much what you ' d expect from any airline , though we had to stop over in Kyoto , Japan for some reason , " said Liz Silvius , 44 , of McLean , VA , who was traveling with her family on a trip to Orlando . " And the in flight movie was a State Department briefing on the North Korean nuclear threat . Not to mention that the guy sitting behind me wouldn ' t shut up about all the brush he cleared at his ranch . "
