Abramovich may have the capital to hide behind underlings ( Kenyon , Buck , Tenenbaum ) , but it doesn ' t take a genius to work out that his love affair with his ' boy ' Shevchenko ( labelled a dressing room spy ) and the gamble on Ballack ( Mourinho was not keen on these two ) heralded the recent change in Chelsea ' s fortunes . You would not get such boardroom interference at any successful and well run club and if we look at the major football dynasties we ' d find that success was built on a foundation of ' one ' man in charge , supported by a whole host of experts Shankly , Busby , Clough , Stein , Paisley , Fergie , Wenger , Benitez , Rijkaard , Ancellotti , Lippi , Hitzfeld . . . On the same subject of Chelsea being a big club You ' re having a laugh aren ' t you . If Man U were playing Anorthosis Famagusta in a Intertoto playoff they ' d have 67 , 000 at the theatre dreams . Chelsea had half the stadium empty on a Champions League night ! ! !
