To try and reconcile the record and fully cooperate with the investigation after I was disciplined in May , we turned over detailed pages of cell phone records and all of the emails that Mr Wells requested . We even contacted the phone company to see if there was any possible way we could retrieve any all of the actual text messages from my old phone . In short , we exhausted every possibility to give the NFL everything we could and offered to go thru the identity for every text and phone call during the relevant time . Regardless , the NFL knows that Mr Wells already had ALL relevant communications with Patriots personnel that either Mr Wells saw or that I was questioned about in my appeal hearing . There is no " smoking gun and this controversy is manufactured to distract from the fact they have zero evidence of wrongdoing .
