' Happy Wrinkly ' of Peebles , the company that makes the chairs , declined to make any comment until the Health and Safety Executive ' s report has been finalised . However , it is believed that the chairs were part of a batch interfered with by a disgruntled employee who had been censured previously for ' turbo charging ' several of the company ' s stair lifts . On that occasion , the stair lifts were adapted to enable a transit time of 0 10 stairs in less than 1 second instead of the more normal 15 seconds . Unfortunately the stair lifts stopped suddenly as they reached the top of the stairs and unrestrained pensioners shot out of them like Olympic High Jumpers .
