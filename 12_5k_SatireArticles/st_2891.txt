" I know this is going to sound made up , but they say that Sheila , the wife , sometimes looks in the mirror , and , like , sees someone else , " Lax said . " Well , not exactly someone else , but , like and this is super creepy a younger version of herself . And apparently , the woman she sees in the mirror , she ' s a lot more beautiful than Sheila is , and she ' s married to someone else , someone who doesn ' t call her names when he gets angry and whom she still loves and feels close to .
