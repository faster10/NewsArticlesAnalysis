And then . Iraq . Whether or not it was a just war , isn ' t the point . The point is that the way it was entered into was very questionable . Congress gave President Bush the power to send our troops to Iraq should he find sufficient need to do so . He apparently did . So , America started a second war , while still claiming to be focused on one much more important to the American people . More troops , many more troops , were sent over to Iraq than were ever sent overseas to fight terrorism . This was hard to make sense out of for many Americans . Some even went to the ridiculous extreme of saying that if you don ' t support the war in Iraq , you don ' t support the troops . One of the more ridiculous sayings I ' ve ever heard . Why ? Why did we go to Iraq ? The " why " really doesn ' t matter . Our President lost focus on what he claimed to be more important than anything else , eliminating terrorism . The economy has struggled , and why ? Remember that 3 . 4 unemployment rate from 2000 . As of July 2004 that rate is now back up to 5 . 8 . We ' re headed on a path to blow right past that 6 . 5 from 1993 . Should we be surprised ? We did elect a President without a successful background and with no U . S . Government experience .
