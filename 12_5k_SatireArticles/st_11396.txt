I kept trying to do more and more bizarre things , but everybody just took it so seriously . I realise some people might be a little upset with all the confuserations and , you know , the thousands of deaths and all . But I just ask the American people to open their hearts to forgive . And I also say that if you take a long look at me and my Presidency , can you honestly tell me some part of you didn ' t know it was a prank ? "
