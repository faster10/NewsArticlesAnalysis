Falling poll numbers , and divisive criticism from Democrats in Congress , appear to be generating conflicts in the White House . Press Secretary Robert Gibbs delivered a few barbs to the " Professional Left " with a suggestion of giving them " drug tests . " Economic advisor Christina Romer submitted her resignation , which many believe came as a result of attempting " economic policy " instead of following the White House " Blame Bush " strategy for recovery . Budget Director Peter Orszag got canned after telling Congress " I ' m not your gimp , so don ' t think I ' ll just make up sh t so you can spend like drunken sailors . " Meanwhile , Rahm Emanuel has put a sign on his door : " FREE ASS KICKINGS INSIDE . . . ( for Free Lollipops and Unicorns , Go See Speaker of the House ) . " There are rumors that Rahm has " gotten mellow " and is smoking marijuana in his office instead of referring to all Democrats as " Retards . "
