According to Lerner , rather than acknowledging that a film like The Dark Knight Rises is entertaining , the way a normal person might , he has a special duty to argue that it is , in fact , completely horrible . Describing the movie as " an overhyped snooze , " Lerner noted that director Christopher Nolan is a ponderous and only marginally talented filmmaker , and that no serious person could possibly enjoy the performance of Christian Bale , an actor Lerner described as " not nearly as good as people think he is . "
