Manning will be entering the last year of a 5 year 96 million contract he signed in early 2012 . It should be noted he is currently nursing a foot injury , which could cause him to miss the rest of the 2015 season . If that be the case , he and the Broncos will be faced with important decision . The only reason that could justify putting his body through the rigors of another season would be pursuit of the aforementioned career completions mark . Beyond that , it just wouldn ' t make sense for either Manning or the Broncos if he were to choose to return .
