" I must say , I have known about the missing bees and much to my amazement I found a bee in my garden , so I phoned 999 and asked for the police " , reports Moore . " The police arrived about 11 hours later but unfortunately the bee had left and it was dark , so I looked for the moon using my wide angled telescope instead but couldn ' t find that either so I reported it missing to the police , by phoning 999 again " .
