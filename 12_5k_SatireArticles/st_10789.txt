At first , he was a relatively harmless criminal , only using a gun to assure his getaway . " He was really kind of nice during the whole time he was robbing us , and he tried to tell some jokes , I suppose to lighten the mood . " Connie Melton , teller at First Community Bank in Dallas , said at the time . " He seemed nervous , and he asked me to please laugh at him when he joked . I didn ' t really think he was funny , but I laughed anyway , not so much at his jokes , but more at the circumstances . It ' s not every day that a robber tells you jokes while you ' re filling his bag with money . "
