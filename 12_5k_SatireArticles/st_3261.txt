Svoboda has been playing his self penned inspirational tunes for community residents since 1989 . Sometimes , in area churches or veterans ' lodges , he provides slide show accompaniment , featuring watercolor Bible story illustrations by his friend Warren . Some would say his unique brand of personal ministry is not terribly effective , since in the eight years he has been musically witnessing , he has only converted four people to the Lord , and three of those were among a vanload of retarded adults on a field trip . But to Svoboda , each one is a victory .
