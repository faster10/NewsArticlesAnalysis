Typical of both liberal and conservative voters who have been against a Trump candidacy , was Rob Lewn of Murfreesboro , Tennessee . Talking to us at a local coffee and bait shop , the forty five year old Lewn said he wasn ' t planning on voting for Trump and is , " even more set against " the candidate now . Lewn didn ' t seem too surprised about the microcephaly , " I always thought his hair was like a helmet that hides or protects something , I ' ll bet it could stop a sword . " Lewn laughed and punctuated his assertion with a playful crisscross motion of his arm .
