" It wasn ' t exactly like we planned it , to be honest , " Dwayne said . " In fact , when Carla told me she was pregnant again , I was kinda worried , on account of me losing my job at the screen door factory and all . Money ' s real tight right now , and I wasn ' t sure we could make ends meet . But still , us having to sell the trailer and temporarily move back into Carla ' s parents ' place isn ' t so bad , if you think about it , since it ' s a such a miracle , I guess . "
