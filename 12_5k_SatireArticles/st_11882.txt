Founded in 1925 by J . L Paton as a way to dispel the stereotype of the " dumb Newfie , the University regrettably sank in 1925 . This was because it had been built on top of the surface of the water , out of bricks , which do not float . After identifying the problem , the Paton rebuilt the University in 1930 , this time on a raft . Unfortunately , he forgot to tie it to the dock and it was subsequently lost in the Atlantic . The University was rebuilt again in 1940 and has stayed put for the last 73 years , mostly through sheer dumb , blind luck .
