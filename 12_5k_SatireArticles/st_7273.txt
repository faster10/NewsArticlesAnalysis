" These representations aren ' t a strictly accurate record , " The Penguin declared . " I felt that I was misrepresented , and I ' m sure that Brucey was too . For example : I was never keen on sushi , or raw fish of any kind . I preferred to tuck into a nice steak and kidney pie , with chips and gravy , the kinda thing that the Ken Mither Yorkshire guy keeps promoting online , but I guess that didn ' t fit in with the director ' s vision . Same kinda thing with Bruce , as I recall . He never acted like a frickin ' bat . I mean , he never hung upside down from the ceiling eating moths , or any of that stuff . He always seemed kind of preoccupied to me . You know ? Like he had problems going on in his head . Frankly I wasn ' t surprised to hear that Robin and Batwoman were a real pain in the ass , with their youthful enthusiasm , zest for life , dietary fads and all that . All in all , it ' s no surprise to discover that the Batguy was always a trifle nuts . "
