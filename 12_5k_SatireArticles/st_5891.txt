" We ' ve been trying to stay within a budget , " Moynihan said . " You ' d think that once you paid admission , you ' d be covered . But then there ' s parking , souvenirs , and game tickets . And food here is outrageous . Ten dollars for a burger and a Coke ? If we didn ' t have to keep a constant presence in the park , our officers never knowing when or where the killer might strike next , we ' d probably bring a cooler full of sandwiches and eat in the parking lot . "
