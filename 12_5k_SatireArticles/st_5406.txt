" If we don ' t reach out to these kids now , while they ' re still young , who will they learn from ? " Stephens said . " Who is going to teach them to force double edged razor blades into the victim ' s mouth and force him to chew ? To sever the Achilles ' tendons ? To carve cabalistic symbols into the back ? To slice the webbing under the armpits ? And to tie the arms behind the back before hanging the victim upside down from a roof beam , cutting their throat from ear to ear ? "
