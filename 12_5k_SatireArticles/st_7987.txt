I had the chance to talk to the man ' s Windows 925 , who had this to say in his defense : " What he didn ' t tell you is that he was on his third beer when he text Chuck . He typed " do u wanna xomed over for da game ? " How am I supposed to translate that into something intelligible ? I took a guess and went with comedy , seeing as he had pushed an extra button . And for the record , he looked at me several times throughout the game to check the time . "
