The toilet block in question pre dates the ground . It is a single story brick built construction , with no electric lights or plumbing , known to the fans that frequent the ground as the Dark Hole of Calcutta . Situated in one corner next to the main turnstiles , it is unused by any bar the exceedingly desperate . Due to the lack of plumbing , there are no cubicles , and no washing facilities . Those that do use it , do so at risk of standing in stale piss and urinating on their shoes .
