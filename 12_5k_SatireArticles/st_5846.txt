Dorje retired from active service after the ill fated Apollo 13 mission , during which he suffered exhaustion and hypothermia as a result of carrying extra oxygen back and forth to the crippled capsule . Astronauts John Swigert , Fred Haise , and James Lovell credit their survival to Dorje ' s six trips to Cape Kennedy for air bottles without any breaks for food or sleep . In the film Apollo 13 , however , Dorje ' s story arc was reduced to a pair of two minute cameos played by George Takei and eventually cut at the request of Tom Hanks .
