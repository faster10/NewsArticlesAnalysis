" In a flat race I don ' t stand a hope in hell . " Said Pistorius , warming up for the race by hopping up and down onto a barrel . " But you have to remember that we are talking about a wild animal , in a stadium full of really drunk people , screaming in its face . He could easily start going backwards or jump into the stands and get in a fight . Anything could happen . I just have to concentrate on my own race , hop by hop . . . and not worry about the ' roo .
