An indoor , 12 lane , gun range will be in the same locale as a restaurant and retail store . It ' s slated to open in a building that has been vacant for two years on the city ' s west side near Interstate 95 . This unique eatery and gun range can be a destination location of NRA conferences and meetings . Politicians who take money for campaign donations from the NRA can hold get togethers here where all are in unison that it ' s wonderful the modern day USA has goteen so insanely guns gone wild that it ' s a lot like living in the Wild West . After a hearty meal , shoot ' em up at the gun range , then stop by the store and buy a trinket for wifey some ruby or sapphire earrings fitted to be in the shape of six shooters , maybe ?
