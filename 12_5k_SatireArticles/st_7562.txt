Popeye reportedly sealed his fated when he resorted to a can of botulism contaminated spinach during a bar fight in his hometown of Chester , Illinois . Several of Popeye ' s friends were with him trying to convince him to discard the can of spinach he had with him because it appeared to be swollen and puffy , which is a sign that canned foods may contain the bacteria that produces the poison . Popeye told his friends , " I ' ve been eatin ' me spinach for seventy years . It helped me kick the crap out of a pile of Krauts and Japs . Ya think I ' m gonna suddenly quit eatin it now ? " Several foreign tourists at the bar overheard Popeye ' s insensitive remarks and started an altercation , which prompted Popeye to pop open , and consume the deadly can of spinach .
