In a claim that hasn ' t been able to be corroborated , Salmond says he remembers meeting a tearful Lulu in Stringfellows in the early 80s who was forced to sing for sleazy English aristocrats quaffing champagne , and he adds , ' I ' m sure as she was past her best looks wise , she had to lie back and think of Bonnie Scotland in order to pay for the schooling for her children , each and every night ' . Why why why do we allow this to happen to Scottish women let alone cultural treasures like Lulu .
