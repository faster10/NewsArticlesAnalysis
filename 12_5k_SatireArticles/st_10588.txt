Richardson ' s suit further alleges that the harassing phone calls began shortly after their breakup two years ago . " At first I thought it was cute , " she said , " but then he started calling at all hours of the day and night . Sometimes he just breathed heavily into the phone like some pervert , then he would scream Can you hear me now ? ' at the top of his lungs . I asked him to stop , but he laughed and said , I can ' t hear you . You ' re breaking up . You don ' t want to break up , do you , bitch ? ' "
