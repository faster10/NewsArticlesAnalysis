A child molestation accusation came out in 1993 by Jordan Chandler against Michael Jackson . Long time child actor Macaulay Carson Culkin ( born August 26 , 1980 ) had taken the stand to testify on Jackson ' s behalf . Culkin acknowledged sleeping in Jackson ' s bed a dozen or more times between the ages of 9 and 14 , but insisted nothing of a sexual nature happened between the two . " I ' ve fallen asleep in the same bed with him , " Culkin said . " I ' d just flop down . " Culkin was asked whether the entertainer could have fondled him while he was sleeping . " As far as I know , he ' s never molested me , " Culkin testified . " I find that unlikely . " In a follow up , Culkin was asked if he had ever slept with any other 35 year old men . " Not that I remember , " the actor testified , " but I wasn ' t really friends with a lot of 35 year olds who actually understood me . "
