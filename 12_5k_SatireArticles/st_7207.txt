" I think it is a great idea , " says Brian Skinner of Tacoma , WA . " I shop at Walgreen ' s three or four times a month and I ' m always behind some stupid old hag that is trying to get another nickel off of expired Cadbury eggs or better yet , this one time I was behind an old guy that kept trying to pay with his driver ' s license . Without fail , I go in for what is supposed to be a thirty second trip and end up wishing I had access to a biohazard lab . "
