" I just got through reading his first novel , " said Guy " Diggy " Moeposant , Williams ' editor at Willingsworth Publishing , an imprint of Shark ' s Teeth Laughing Hyena Press . " It ' s compelling but rambles a bit . Although there ' s a plotline , for some reason , Brian Williams keeps putting himself into the work . He really has no business being in there . Whenever the protagonist , a Marine General fighting a war on the island of Tasmania , does something really heroic , like save an entire village from being blown to smithereens , who saves the day ? Not Marine General Hardy Handratty . No . It ' s Brian Williams . He ' s a regular superhero . "
