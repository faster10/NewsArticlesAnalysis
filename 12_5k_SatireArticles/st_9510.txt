Those advanced life forms that live in a non physical dimension in our space are controlled by the parallel force in that other space the advanced life forms would be invisible energy controlled by that parallel force as apposed to physical matter controlled by the same parallel force . In our space there are two or more different dimensions that are occupied by non physical life forms that evolved in our universe from other worlds and stars . There is an integration of dimensions in our space that also allows the integration of physical matter . A chair in our world is integrated in those other dimensions which would allow an advanced life form in the non physical dimension the ability to lift up the chair and hurl it out a window if that is what it chooses .
