The leaders of several Christian Democratic parties of EU nations issued statements . One such statement said : " We wholeheartedly welcome our Turkish brothers who have finally seen the light . We must emphasize that Turkey ' s membership in the EU will in no way be affected by this question of religion , and we will continue to adhere to the objective criteria established from the beginning . It may of course be some years until all the conditions are realized and we will be watching developments closely . Especially since it may take up to another 25 years and a new generation with majority of Turkish men to convincingly be Christian and uncircumcised . "
