I had a trusted man in my church address the youth ( 14 to 18 ) once on homosexuality . He said that half of all gay males may be kind and submissive , but the other half were predatory . Guess what ? It came out several years later that this same man was a predatory gay ! He molested and " turned " dozens of males in our church ( and many of them during his " counseling " sessions ) . He ruined many lives . At least one of his victims later spent time in jail for doing the exact same thing that he was taught by this man .
