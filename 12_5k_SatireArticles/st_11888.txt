History : The UofT was founded in 1827 by study drug enthusiast Bishop Strachan as a place where miserable young people could take unhealthy amounts of adderall in the pursuit of a degree that wouldn ' t even help them that much . By upholding this tradition through the last two centuries , UofT has established itself as one of the twitchiest and most irritable universities in the world . UofT is composed of somewhere between 6 and 13 colleges that do some stuff and please don ' t ask too many questions about what they are and why they ' re there .
