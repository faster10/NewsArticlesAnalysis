Most blacks were surprised by this revelation , but one writer for a popular black magazine ( who wished to remain anonymous ) , wasn ' t . " I knew it ! Only a man with a deep , pro white mentality and a burning hatred for black men could possibly write those screenplays , " he said . " I mean , he has these men using these women , treating them like dogs , and then when the black woman comes back to them , such weakness is passed off as the sista being strong . Second , I ' ve been on this earth more than fifty years , and I have never met a black man like Leroy Brown or Madea . "
