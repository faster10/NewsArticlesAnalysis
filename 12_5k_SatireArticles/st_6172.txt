" They really don ' t do much , " Beth said . " Once in a while , John and I will see our Uno cards spread out all over the kitchen table or the refrigerator door left slightly ajar . If we go out on a Sunday afternoon , sometimes we come back to find a few coupons clipped out of the newspaper for things we never use , like cream of mushroom soup or Metamucil . As haunting goes , it ' s pretty tame stuff . "
