Senator John McCain also said he doesn ' t use the Internet either . Asked how he gets by without it , McCain laughed and replied , " Morse code . Just kidding . I have my interns take care of that stuff . I dictate or pass notes to them . They also do that social media stuff for me . Like that Twitter . Tweeter ? Whatever it ' s called , you won ' t see pics of my junk on it like former congressman Anthony Weiner . Poor Weiner . See . That ' s what happens when you use the Internet . "
