" A few years ago , " said Orange , " there was a banana shortage . This saw us replace bananas with bars . There was nothing we could do . With each shortage of fruit that has hit the industry we have been forced to replace the fruit with something non fruit based . When we replaced strawberries with diamonds , that cost us a lot of money , and when hearts replaced cherries , we were spending a lot of nights down the graveyard digging up the freshly dead . I ' m glad nobody figured out where we getting all the hearts from . "
