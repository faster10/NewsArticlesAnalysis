" I was unable to read the entire resolution myself . One of my aides , who will be sent to Syria , perhaps Egypt , read me key pieces over the phone . Unfortunately , he did not get to the important part about this being the CIA . He just ran through the different sections on violent regime change , state sponsored assassinations , economic subversive activities , torture , civilian imprisonment , Geneva violations , and international kidnapping I mean , yes , if another country did these things then the U . S . would have just cause to pass this resolution and liberate them . But , the U . S . is in a global war on terror and I ' m a war time Senator . Our enemies don ' t afford us the niceties of resolutions and debate . The CIA can and must use all tactics available . We know that the U . S . doesn ' t torture , a fact that ' s been upheld in secrecy many , many times . I will be calling for a vote correction today . "
