" I just found out that it ' s true " , stated Harry Valletti of New Jersey . ' I thought it was another GOP political ploy but People in my slot , 50 150 per year as a foreman who works 6 7 days a week , I could be out over half my wages with all the new rules plus all the taxes we already had . I gotta friend over in the city that might can take care of this . Maybe a few shake downs . Hah ! I was only kidding . I ' m Italian so you thought " The Mob ' didn ' t you ? "
