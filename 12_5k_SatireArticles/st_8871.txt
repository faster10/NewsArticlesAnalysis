Although Jacko and I disagree on nearly everything , I have to agree with him here . Until the nations of the world start brandishing much stiffer penalties against those who poach , abuse , and indiscriminately kill ( usually for shits and giggles ) , these poor , defenseless animals , this sort of thing will go on and on and on . I wouldn ' t be against sending someone like George Bush ( the guy from the Erith section of London , England , and not , and I will repeat , not either of the Republican U . S . Presidents who also have that first and last name , to prison for double digit years .
