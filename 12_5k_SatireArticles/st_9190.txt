I asked Senator Reid how will this lead to energy independence being that the vast majority of sugar consumed in the US is already imported ? I also reminded him that out of 44 billion pounds of sugar consumed in the US a year , only 17 billion pounds of it is grown domestically . Senator Reid responded with the following , " We have thought about that , and that ' s why we are currently drafting a bill to end all agricultural production in this country other than sugarcane . It is our hopes that if we can create an artificial famine , over the next 3 4 years the population will drastically drop due to starvation and then we will have a surplus of sugar . " Reid continued by saying , " This is a multi step plan . First we lower consumption by starving the American people to death , then we get the economy moving by becoming an exporting nation . It is our goal to become the worlds largest exporter of sugar . "
