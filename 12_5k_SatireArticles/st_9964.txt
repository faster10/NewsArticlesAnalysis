In front of the front rows milled the militia , whose duty including protecting Trump from the media and any liberal thugs who crawled in under the edge of the big top . The sawdust on the floor was a nice touch , especially when some of Trump ' s supporters had a little too much of the peppermint flavored moonshine for sale at the snack stands . The sawdust absorbed everything and then the clean up crews swept it up and hauled it away . It also made for a convenient place to throw our peanut shells and rinds . I told Milkforce not to eat the things they referred to as " cracklin ' " , but he didn ' t listen . When I told him what it was , before it was cracklin ' , well , let ' s just say that the clean up crew was on the ball .
