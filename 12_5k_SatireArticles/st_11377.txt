Said , Jackson , " All I done was ta call that whitey suck ass Obama a nigga , who don ' t need no balls and they secluded me from talkin ' at the Convention ! They be all whitey lovers ! " Jackson was talking in his native Ebonics , which was the common language of black people where he grew up poor in South Carolina . He will automatically revert to it in a private ' black ' person to person conversation . In a public setting , however , his English usage is excellent .
