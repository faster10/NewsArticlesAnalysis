At Marleybone , McCabe will be required to partake in a number of unpleasant activities , including making small talk with several assholes who used to openly mock him during high school , and reminiscing about the " good old days " of which he was never a part . While the consumption of alcohol will initially make the evening more tolerable , McCabe is ultimately expected to leave the bar after realizing he has just as little in common with all these assholes as he did when he was 15 .
