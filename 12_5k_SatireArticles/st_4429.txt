" The basics of the Nietzschean regimen are simple , " Hollingdale wrote in the book ' s foreword . " The dieter exercises a painful amount of self honesty in order to identify the primary object of his or her deepest human dread as personified by a wide ranging group of foodstuffs . Once the dieter ' s Fear has been identified , he eats that food exclusively , in unlimited amounts , until the food no longer appetizes or frightens him . Having completed his gorge and transcended his fear , the dieter fasts for 20 days on water and Simple Salad . The dieter also engages in moderate metaphysical exercise , drinks eight brimming bowls of water every day , and ' opens the Gates of Dread and Fiber that remain closed to him in his Mundane Life ' by taking fiber supplements .
