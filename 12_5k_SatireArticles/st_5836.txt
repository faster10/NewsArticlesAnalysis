My wife decided to " powder her nose " during a quick Game Show Network commercial break and left me the clicker . Hoo boy watch out ! I am a channel surfing demon , and this was no exception . It ' s like a drug to me , like I can never find the perfect thing to watch . Nothing good on Lifetime , nothing on Hallmark . So I switch to Showtime and see if anything " lascivious " is going on . Maybe a glimpse of thigh to get me in the mood for whoa let me stop right there !
