The real estate mogul read the full statement at a recent press conference , and fielded a number of tough , hard hitting questions . Matt Harper asked if the apology was particularly timed after his latest strings of comments were criticized describing the remote Anuta Polynesian tribe for having " ugly huts " and " weird hair styles . " He said in response , " Not at all , the apology came because it was the right time to apologize . All those times people were asking me to apologize were wrong and stupid . This is already the best apology of all time . "
