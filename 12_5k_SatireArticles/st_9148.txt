The anti capital punishment group Citizens Against Punishment of Undeserving Turkeys ( CAPUT ) said through a spokesperson , " This is a very enlightened stand on the part of the President . For years , the cause of capital punishment has been trivialized by the Annual Turkey Pardoning . Capital punishment is something that should never be made light of . This may seem like an odd stance on the part of our organization , but the hypocrisy of pardoning one turkey while slaughtering millions does our cause more harm than good . "
