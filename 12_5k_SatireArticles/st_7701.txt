Ubiquitously promiscuous Peaches , 14 , is the great niece of the late Hughie Green , who was famous for being impersonated by Mike ' and this is me ' Yarwood , and for hosting the primitive TV ' talent show ' Opportunity Knocks which was popular in the Middle Paleolithic Period and which inspired modern day shows like Britain ' s Got Ego Maniacs and Twat Factor . It also inspired juicy jailbait lookalike Peaches , 13 , as she realised that she could grasp the opportunity to use her knockers to get head , er , ahead .
