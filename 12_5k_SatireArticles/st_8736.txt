' It was just bad luck that both congas arrived at the corner at exactly the same time , ' says Matt . ' The next thing I knew was I was on the floor with lots of bodies falling on top of me . It wasn ' t my fault , ' he says . Though Matt does claim that the leader of the other conga , George Wigham was moving too fast . ' George was probably in a rush to get back into the pub to his pint , ' says Matt . ' And frankly , he ' d already had too much to drink so shouldn ' t have been leading a conga in the state he was in . '
