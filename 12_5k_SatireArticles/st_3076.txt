The initial memorial , a somber wall of polished black marble , hand etched with the full names , ranks , hometowns , and the birth and death dates of the 139 military personnel killed during the invasion , was designed by world renowned architect Kai Tomasson in July 2003 . In October of that year , its stark yet elegant imagery was augmented with another 10 foot wall , and in March 2006 , Tomasson submitted blueprints for the monument ' s second level . Though the memorial committee had spent its 12 million budget by late 2005 , Tomasson volunteered his services for 19 additional adjustments before handing over the reins for this latest extension to DiForetti Sons , a D . C . area contractor known for reliability and honesty .
