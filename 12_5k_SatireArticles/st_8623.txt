In an announcement at the team ' s temporary headquarters in San Antonio , Texas , team spokesman Fernie Lewinsky announced definite plans to relocate the team . " Next year , we plan to play our home games as far away from the water as we can . We don ' t want no hurricanes . Because of this fear , we find that we cannot move to Los Angeles . San Antionio is only a couple of hundred miles from the beach and they got drenched with rain when that second hurricane hit . Portland , Oregon also wants a football team , but they are in the same situation . "
