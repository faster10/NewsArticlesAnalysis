" I would advise the president to remove himself , his family , and his staff from the premises immediately . I would like to make a special plea to President Bush himself please don ' t eat any more of the paint . I know it ' s light and crunchy and tastes just like one of those fancy remanufactured potato chips that come in a can , but it is not a potato chip . Please Mr President , stop stripping paint off the walls during meetings . "
