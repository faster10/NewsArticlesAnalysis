Another song likely to resonate with Lorde ' s fan base is " So Old . " In the low key number Lorde tells her poigniant story : " I use to be seventeen once But now I ' m eighteen I used to like parties and stuff But now it ' s like whatever I ' m guess I ' m like so old So old I ' m eighteen now . " As with " Little White Yugos , " the song is hypnotically slow and almost boring , yet strangely catchy and hauntingly memorable .
