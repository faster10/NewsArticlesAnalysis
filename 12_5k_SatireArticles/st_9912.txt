Saul : " Typhoon Maggie Thatcher has cleared the azores . Death toll yet to be counted . Hurricane Fuhrer meanwhile has petered out . Thousands of Finlanders have had to evacuate their homes due to flooding . The good news is that the cost of imported lumber has declined . Newspapers are jubilant even the left wing ones . More of that later . Meanwhile , Tsunami Kissinger that has caused thousands of lives in Sri Lanka has petered out by all accounts . Tsunami Kissinger it is said was not so severe as its predecessor Tsunami Reagan which many thought was but a large tidal wave at the time but took over a million lives across the South Pacific . Aid is being flown in from Ireland as we speak . Monsoon J . K Rowling that has laid waste to much of Northern India seems also to have abated . Many thousands dead there too Palmela . Might have to forego the pancakes as well ( laughing ) . Where is Harry Potter when you need him ?
