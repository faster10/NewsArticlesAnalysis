In the press area , Ivana said that " the man approached me earlier and asked me very , very nasty questions . He wanted to know if I was going to perform my jumps and spins without wearring any panties . He wanted to know if performing on the cold ice helped to make my nipples so hard . He wanted to know if it hurt my back because I perform without a bra . He wanted me to lift my skirt so that he could take pictures of my vagina that were in better focus because I wasn ' t moving so fast . "
