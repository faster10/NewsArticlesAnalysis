One octogenarian described how he and his wife ( 78 ) could no longer afford designer Wellingtons for trips to Glastonbury , and how the lack of a hearing aid loop at the outdoor venue had spoiled the music . " It ' s a disgrace , when there ' s a 4 kilowatt PA system , and you ' re stood next to the speakers as usual , and can ' t hear your wife speaking to you . What if there ' d been an emergency ? " he said . " The government should have a Wellington allowance for festival goers over 65 , at least . As for a hearing loop , well , should be standard equipment , surely ? "
