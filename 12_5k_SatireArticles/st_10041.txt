Dedicated to President Donald J . Trump from the Puerto Rican People . With this statue we honor your " sacrifice " to rescue Puerto Rico . We are honored to be counted among your countless sacrifices . You and Christopher Columbus , who ' discovered ' us in 1493 , will be held in equal esteem . May this statue keep your legacy alive for eternity . Your great literary master piece , The Art of the Deal , inspired us to make Puerto Rico Great Again without being great the first time . Only you could do that . With heart felt sentiment we say muchas gracias senor ! We commit ourselves with upmost fidelity to live according to your creed . Hence , in your honor this plaza shall be known today and forever as the " Art of the Steal " .
