According to the terms of the new McMahon imposed legislative process , X Representatives from all 50 states will introduce bills to the Big Bad House Of Pain . Bills passed by a simple majority will be run through The Gauntlet Of Warriors , a hard core third house of Congress where proposed legislation must survive not only a floor vote but a vicious beating with spiked clubs . If the bill survives , it moves on to the X Senate and then to the president , who can then either sign it or challenge its sponsor to a chainsaw joust . If defeated in the joust , the bill ' s sponsor is banished for all eternity to Capitol Hell .
