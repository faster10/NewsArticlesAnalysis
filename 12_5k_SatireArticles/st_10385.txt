" In the raids we ' ve done so far , only one was successful . Here ' s what we know : the equipment usually consists of just a clear tank . We ' ve seen one situation where a jar was used . The drug dealers form a circle around the tank and someone is named the judge . All bets are placed on the floor near the tank as the " pot " , and then both fish are put into the tank . The judge calls when one fish is dead , and the winner takes the pot . We have evidence suggesting in one night , sometimes as many as thirty beta fish fights take place . "
