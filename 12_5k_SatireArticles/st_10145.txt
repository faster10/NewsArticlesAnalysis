MSNBC ' s only comment on the story , via a spokesperson , was : " We already have Keith Olbermann covering the missing e mail story , OK ? For some stupid reason , he thought it was important to cover BEFORE we found out they were young , cute and blond . Don ' t ask us why . Anyway , none of the rest of us really thinks it ' s that big a deal . Didn ' t you guys know we FIRED Don Imus ? Now THAT ' S a REAL story ! "
