Research has been done that shows both men and women tend not to trust a man who has gel in his hair . In one experiment , University of Pennsylvania researchers recruited 40 college students to participate in what they said was a study of teaching effectiveness , but in reality was to look at a man ' s use of hair gel on social attitudes . In the experiment , a man was given material to " teach " to the participants in three separate sessions . The man went through the " class " in the exact same way and said the exact same thing each time . The only difference was in his hair . For one class , he had no hair gel , for another , he had some hair gel , and for the third , he had gobs of it . The results were surprising in how stark the participants ' responses were : the version of the man with no hair gel was overwhelmingly perceived as the more effective teacher , and the version of him with the most hair gel was perceived as the least effective .
