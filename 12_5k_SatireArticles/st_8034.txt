" The fact that it ' s still there is a science experiment waiting to happen , " said Michael Dennehy , commissioner of the city ' s Department of Public Works .

From the placement of the quote in the story , I think he ' s talking about the broken bill , but he could be talking about the political science of what the city administration will do with that Vinson Massif of a dump heap . Who ' s to guess ?
