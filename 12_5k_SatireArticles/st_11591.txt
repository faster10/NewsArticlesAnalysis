So , J . J Abrams , if you ' re not going to listen to me now , at least do one thing right . After your trilogy is all said and done , after the crowds have come and gone , after decades have passed and a new generation is ready to see your movies again , promise me this : If you ' re not going to ruin Star Wars now , at least ruin it 20 years from now when you re release your movies all over again . Or just let me do it for you .
