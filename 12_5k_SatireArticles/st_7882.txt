" The problem with the standard model , " said Higgs , who is eighty two you know , " is that it says that nothing has mass . People talk about unifying relativity and quantum theory a lot , but what they ' re basically saying is that quantum theory has a big hole in it called mass . It says there is none , but drop a truck on somebody and it will hurt . So I came up with the Higgs field while eating a croissant in the student canteen . "
