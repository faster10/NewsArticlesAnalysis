The worst case scenario would be McDonalds claiming tax free status for being a religious corporation and putting up religious symbols in their restaurants and handing out the prayer messages of every major religion stamped on their paper bags . They would do this for an extra level of protection . The franchise owners would be preachers who manage their religious eatery . McDonalds could sustain itself solely on bonds that are indefinite with 30 of the interest payments reinvested yearly at a low rate . McDonalds would argue that it ' s cheaper borrowing money from bond holders than from a bank . Bond holders would replace stock holders and they would practically drain the corporation dry keeping it constantly in debt under the guise of a free market economy . It ' s not illegal for an institution to lend money to a religious corporation . Bond holders would hold property rights as collateral mimicking the rights of a stock holder and with voting privileges to safe guard their investment . " After McDonalds , every other corporation in America would follow , " explained Bieber .
