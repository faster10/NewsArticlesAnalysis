" The Oakdale Court yard sale is a microcosm of an economic model played out every weekend in cul de sacs across the nation , " Clybourne said . " It is a closed system in which the mere presence of goods creates demand for said goods . The supplier becomes the consumer , and capitalism breaks down and devolves into its embryonic state of pseudo bartering . Any item , by virtue of its existence within the closed system , becomes something with an intrinsic value and built in level of demand . How else could you explain somebody paying 1 . 50 for a scratched vinyl copy of Men At Work ' s Cargo ? "
