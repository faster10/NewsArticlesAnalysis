Like , red pants , is one thing . But I ' ve lost more than just my legs , I ' ve lost everything that goes with having legs . I ' ve lost the ability to show off my huge collection of pumps , flats and platforms , not to mention my fav casual Sperrys , which I started wearing waaay before Old Navy started flooding the market with their bland nautical themed junk . Not to mention my array of designer socks , from thigh high , to knee high , to my cute toe socks that boys love ! Ughh ! What an asshole ! I ' d be saying that I hope that driver dies , but like he already did , along with his family , and they were like super white trash anyway , so whatever . But it ' s not like there ' s any justice in that . I ' m never going to be able to buy shoes again ! Oh , or toe rings at the beach ! WTF !
