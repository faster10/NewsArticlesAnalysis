" I have other things lined up . I ' m going to play an alien on Star Wars Clone Wars , and they say it might be a recurring role . I have a guest spot on Spongebob coming up , I ' ll be in costume , or course , but I ' ll be in the show . I was talking to the guys at Family Guy , and they said they might have a few spots I could play on the Cleveland Show . The problem is that I ' m so well known as the bully , a lot of offers have come in as a one show bully or villain . That ' s the last thing I want to play now . " Nelson said .
