Government announcements have been given little media coverage . Dumpy Shirtsoff , who is advisor to the Minister for Dogs and Bacon , was caught semaphoring an internal memo to his colleagues about recent plans to jetison failing public infrastructure . The memo read : " Railways scrapped . NHS scrapped . Schools will be shut down tomorrow , kids will be taught in fields , as discussed in the recent conference on the ' Khmer Rouge ' if successful , maybe we can send some Pakis there too . "
