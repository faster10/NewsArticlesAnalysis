Dean claims that the honk had saved his life . " I wish I could thank that other driver , " he says . " He has no idea what he has done . I was a rude , self indulged person , but when he honked at me it made me think : Boy ! He didn ' t like that ! Not one bit ! I feel bad now ! I should not have cut him off ! Maybe I ' ll think twice next time because I wouldn ' t ever want to be honked at ever , ever again ! That ' s what I thought . "
