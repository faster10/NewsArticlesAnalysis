Earlier today the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man , Mrs Butterworth , and the chocolate Easter Bunny went on a rampage in Washington DC to protest this new law . The three sugary characters called themselves Occupy The Hill . The chocolate Easter Bunny and Mrs Butterworth were melted into a puddle by flamethrower wielding S . W . A . T . teams and then later recycled into ethanol fuel . The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man was also injured in this protest and is currently in a sugar induced coma and is not expected to survive .
