There are Republicans that will vote for George W Bush no matter what happens and what is proven because he ' s a Republican . That ' s that . That ' s sad . There are Democrats that will vote for John F Kerry no matter what happens and what is proven because he ' s a Democrat . That ' s that . That ' s also sad . Come November many Americans who have an open mind and take the time to look at the facts will have a decision to make . That decision shouldn ' t be that difficult . Do we continue to punish the Democratic Party for a " Lewinsky " one Democrat received and all of the subsequent Republican accusations , or do we recognize the advantages America as a whole has with them in office ? There are only two paths . One leads us back to a great period in time . I don ' t even want to think about the other one .
