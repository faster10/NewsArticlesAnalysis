Although Tuesday marked the first time the group has fully reunited , the members of Soundgarden have had a few near misses in the past 10 years . In August 2000 , all four members were seen entering Seattle area Arby ' s restaurants , but the reunion never materialized : Cornell and Cameron visited the Meridian Avenue location , while Thayil and Shepherd decided to visit the Michigan Street franchise . The afternoon did , however , mark the largest Temple of the Dog reunion to date , when Cornell and Cameron ran into the rest of the supergroup ' s members in the restroom .
