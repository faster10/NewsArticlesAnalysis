According to Hassim , Limbaugh refused to do so . " I was polite . I said excuse me please sir , but if you could just please be so kind to put out your cigar , but he ignored me and just got into my limo telling me ' you are just a driver so just shut up and drive . ' So I closed the door and got in and drove , knowing that the smell from the cigar would take extra cleaning and it would come out of my pocket . "
