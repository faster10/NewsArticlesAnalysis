" I don ' t think they ' re ready to give up interpreting the law just yet , " Tomaine said . " I wouldn ' t be surprised if a number of these justices get together and start something very similar to the Supreme Court , but under a different name . I heard that Scalia wants to set up a new organization under the name ' The U . S . Supreme Court featuring Antonin Scalia . ' Personally , I think it ' s very disrespectful to use the name of that honorable institution , but I suppose it ' s his right . "
