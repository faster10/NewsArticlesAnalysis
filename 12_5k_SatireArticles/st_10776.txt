" Public safety is our primary mission , ' ' said Ray Roberts , warden of the El Dorado Correctional Facility . " We have a special duty to take care of inmates like Dennis Rader . We want to make sure that he gets thoroughly integrated into the general prison population . We held a prisoner lottery last week to see which prisoners get the first chances to shower with Rader . The winner was a 425 pound sex offender who was just released from our AIDS ward . We have also made it possible for any of the more violent offenders in Mr Rader ' s cell block to have access to the supply room in our sheet metal shop . "
