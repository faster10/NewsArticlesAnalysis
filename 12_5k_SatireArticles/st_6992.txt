Yao Ming , who at 28 will soon be the only active player ever to be inducted into the NBA Hall of Fame , learned to play basketball when he was 3 years old after finding an untamed cobra in the mountains , a cobra of ancient legend whose very breath was poisonous . The cobra was taller than a full grown tree , and beat Yao in one on one basketball competition every day for 19 straight years . Then , the very night before their final game , Yao prayed deeply to his ancestors and ingested more than 20 pounds of Yu Wan Mei fish by products , and behold ! Yao grew three feet while he slept .
