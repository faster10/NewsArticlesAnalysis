Chris Matthew of MSNBC stated that " I ' m going to have to have this woman in my studio for a one on one , sit down interview . This is just fantastic ! When a living legend is voted to something like this over people who have been dead for over 200 years and who appear in all of our history books , it just to shows how great and significant her acts were ! I ' m honored and humbled just to be able to speak to her . She actually gives me tingles in my groin ! "
