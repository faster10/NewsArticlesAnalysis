An unidentified spokesman for Bain , however , did say that there would be several changes to make the RNC more productive and cost effective . " One of the first things that we ' ve done is to fire the long time mascot of the Republican Party , Ollie the Elephant . He ' s been with us a long time , but face it , with the crop failure this past year , we can ' t justify the cost of paying him peanuts . We have found an alternative mascot that , we believe , will better represent not only the party as a whole , including our supporters , but will be cost effective as well . "
