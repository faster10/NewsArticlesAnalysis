" Proper ass containment requires a careful balance between ass space allocation and pants availability , " said Greg Hemming , a spokesman for the U . S . Department of Trouser and Legwear Conservation . " Once that balance is shifted , an ass can cause irreparable damage to its environment , taxing a pantsuit ' s stitching , elastic band and fit beyond its capacity to adapt . In some cases , when a pantsuit ' s resources are strained past the limits of feasibility , it can no longer accommodate the increased pressures of the changing ass . In a worst case scenario , riding , binding and severe seam rippage can be the result . "
