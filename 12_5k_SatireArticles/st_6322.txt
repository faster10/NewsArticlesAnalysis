" This next season or seasons , I ' ll play through pain , injury , personal tragedy , media persecution , and one or more quarterbacks who won ' t be able to get the ball to me when our team or teams need it . And you know I ' ll do it all while putting up so many receptions for so many yards and so many touchdowns that , if I told anyone right now , you ' d think I was being arrogant , " said Owens , who seemed visibly hurt at the thought of what was to come . " It ' s not bragging if it ' s going to be true . And the NFL still insists on fining T . O . for his celebrations , despite the fact that T . O . ' s jerseys for whatever team I ' m going to be playing on will still be setting sales records and making money for the league . After all this , anyone will be able to see that the contract they ' re going to offer me just won ' t be enough . "
