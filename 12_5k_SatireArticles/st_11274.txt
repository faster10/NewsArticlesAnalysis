Mar . 4 : Today ' s planning session of the inner circle did not go well . Hassim informed us he had forgotten to bring the radioactive materials for the " dirty bomb " we planned to build . Akmed told Hassim not to worry . since he ( Hassim ) had been neglecting his personal hygiene for so long that we could use HIM in the dirty bomb and that it would probably cause more damage than the radioactive materials . When all the scratching , biting and hair pulling was over I sent Akmed and Hassim to opposite corners of the cave without their supper .
