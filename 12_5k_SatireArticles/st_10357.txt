" I truly did not , even in my most unabashed inward fantasies of how to most directly improve and thereby enhance the monetary availability to the average citizen of this country , conceive of a proposition remotely close to this during my tenure as dictator over the currency of the free market system , which I helped manage and control for the many years I was in office , " said Greenspan . " I don ' t think it would be irrational exuberance to consider the possibilities of this plan ! This will be the true free market where we are free to print all the cash we need ! "
