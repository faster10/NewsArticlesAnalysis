In October 2009 at the governing council of the Libyan London School of Economics ( once known as the London School of Economics ) , a donation of 1 . 5 million from Saif Gaddafi , son of the Libyan dictator was debated . Fred Halliday , the School ' s Professor of international relations , had warned the council that accepting the money would taint the LSE ' s reputation . Fred Halliday ' s concerns were dismissed by a fellow academic , David Held , Professor of political science . Refusal , Held protested , would cause " personal embarrassment " to Saif Gaddafi .
