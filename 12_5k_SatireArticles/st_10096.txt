Other Kansas City drivers said they never liked being honked at . " I got honked at once , " said Floyd Winters , a 47 year old factory worker . " I never want to go through that again ! It was horrible ! I didn ' t realize I had done anything wrong , not until I was honked at . I hope people honk all the time ! I hope the honking never ceases ! I want those rude drivers out there to know that if you ' re going to drive like an idiot , be prepared to be honked at ! "
