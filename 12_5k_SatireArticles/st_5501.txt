" If I could wave a magic wand and cure Africa ' s problems , I would do that , " drummer Larry Mullen Jr . said . " But someone has to take care of the more practical , day to day stuff that Bono doesn ' t really bother with . Like , for example , how ' s the next album going to sound ? How ' re we going to keep our live act fresh ? I can ' t tell you how many millions of decisions go into making one Elevation tour . "
