" It ' s a win win " said brother Mahmoud , currently under indictment for money laundering , corruption and non payment of income taxes , " we ' ve already pledged support to Mayor Emanuel and will be financing the new " Rahm Emanuel Helmand Casino " , supplying all the cement , the unskilled workers , and fronting the catering and restaurant facilities in exchange for no corporate taxes , and cutting all building code restrictions . Naturally , all Afghan workers will immediately join the Union of the Mayor ' s choice , and fully back his political agenda until pig ' s fly ! " ( oops )
