" As for me , I don ' t fit in so well . I ' d rather talk about ideas in philosophy , religion , or politics . The normals just sigh and say , ' There goes crazy Uncle Leo again , always barking his madness in our direction . ' And then I have to ignore that snub and my craziness takes over . Sometimes I ' ll jump into the kitchen sink and swing the microwave over my head by its cord like a morning star . Maybe I ' ll dance around the living room , shirtless , while my normal family members are exchanging pleasantries and sipping coffee . And they ' ll laugh at me and say again , ' There ' s crazy Uncle Leo for you . ' "
