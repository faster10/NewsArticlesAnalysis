" That totally sucked , " said Tony Aldieri from Michigan , widely regarded as a " burnout " state . " They don ' t really care about the U . S . that much . They just want something to put on their resumes so they can get into a good college . You ' d have to be a real loser to actually be that into this country . This country blows . As soon as I get enough money , I ' m outta here . I ' m packing up my shit and moving someplace cool , like Madagascar . "
