Pattinson also added , well , not really , I made it up , but hey , " Brenda and I told the producers to cut it out and they expected that . The film is truly amazing and I can ' t wait for it ' s release . It ' s mainly our way to see that we have grown up and matured , we are not the same people we were at 14 18 . When I did Twilight I was 17 going on 18 . Don ' t get me wrong I love being part of the Twilight series , but being framed as a tween star is disturbing . I want to be known as a serious star , the term tween when given to Twilight is wrong . Twilight is an amazing film for young adults and young teens . But the media just portrays and categorized everything in a very false way . "
