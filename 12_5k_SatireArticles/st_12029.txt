High school class president Sammy Eisenberg remembers too . " Funny about Anthony . There was one vote for him for Homecoming King one year . We all thought it was him voting for himself . Never could prove it , but I remember a scandal involving some Polaroid pictures found in the girls ' locker room after Anthony was seen sneaking out while the girls were playing Field Hockey ! Everybody laughed it off as a joke thinking someone had taken a picture of a fetal pig ' s penis in biology class . Ha ! Now I guess we know the rest of the story ! "
