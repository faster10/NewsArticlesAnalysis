Now I know that sounds a bit crass and I wish it could be more simple . I wish there was just some kind of blanket rule for these things so I knew what is and isn ' t going to offend people . For example , I don ' t understand why I can wear a cowboy hat to work , but I can ' t wear an aboriginal headdress . Like if someone just said " no funny hats , it would be simple , but according to Brenda these situations are much more " nuanced and " complex .
