One particular experimenter and some say a particularly naive ' inventor ' , Mr Edward C deCorset , of Braintree in Essex is credited to have found inspiration while trying to develop and early type of multi vibrator in order to obtain AC power source form DC which is what most installed generators of his day provided . He was no doubt aware of the better Loss factor of AC compared to DC . A fault occurred in one of the mechanical components in one of the designs he was testing . The result of this is that the rate of ' vibration ' in the multi vibrator became unstable and instead of the intended 50 100HZ there was a sharp rise and it is suspected that in the ' runaway ' cycle the frequency of vibration became in the region of several KHz . The device did run for a brief time ( about 2 minutes , though I think that is an exaggeration ) . What Mr de Corset did notice was that there was a distinct heating being induced into the wiring on the output of the unit under test . There was not even a load on the unit that might have caused such a phenomenon .
