Nicolas Sarkozy couldn ' t hide his disbelief in his concession speech , " Whilst I accept the result I find it amazing that such a proud nation of people could choose to be ruled by another country . It defy ' s common sense . I know my policies have been unpopular but I thought that having a stunning wife would distract people into not thinking about my ridiculous policies . I shall be divorcing Carla ( Bruni ) immediately . It ' s all her fault , clearly she is not beautiful enough to distract red blooded Frenchmen . Either that or there are more gay men than we thought . "
