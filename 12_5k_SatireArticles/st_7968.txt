" PIETI will be a massive , daunting undertaking on all levels . The problems associated with successfully pulling off a monumental endeavor such as this abound , " Pastor Joshua Jacobson of The Joyous Ovis Aries Ministries , PIETI ' s chief administrative coordinator and lead systems analyst told reporters during Tuesday ' s briefing . " I ' m sure there will be many unforeseen hiccups along the way , problems of both a physical and logistical nature . But with the effort of such a talented , gifted team of experts and technicians in play , along with , of course , the divine guiding influence of God ' s hand , I have no doubt we will prevail , " Jacobson went on to say . " God created this world in six days . We are mere mortals , blessed though we may be . So , I guess six years , with a rest period during the seventh while we coordinate the next steps , isn ' t too long when all is said and done . "
