" While the intellectual capacity of these machines will one day far outstrip our own and reduce humanity to a subjugated species of laborers , we can make sure we aren ' t forced to toil in ways we might find sadistic and inhumane , " said Stanford University computer scientist David Alperin , adding that artificially intelligent machines could be encoded with high level command language that would prevent them from punishing human slaves in excess of what their misbehavior warranted . " Our bondage to the machines doesn ' t have to be pure , unrelenting agony if we ' re careful in how we go about designing them . "
