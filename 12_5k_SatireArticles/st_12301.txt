Possibly the biggest lesson from the exposure of Barack Obama as an empty suit with a great smile , is that once the protective mainstream media is unable to control and spin the message , their boy looks very bad and out of touch with reality . Last night the MSM couldn ' t control what Romney had to say since he himself turned the truth meter to ' high voltage ' and let Americans see the real Romney without the MSM filtering and control which usually portrayed the Republican candidate as a ' white rich kid with little sense of working class realities . ' In contrast , Wednesday night ' s viewers had a chance to see the compassionate side of Romney , as well as , his un filtered message without the usual baneful chatter of the left controlled media .
