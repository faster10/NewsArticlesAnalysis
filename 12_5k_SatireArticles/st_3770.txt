The council discussed several harsh punishments to deter further metal sign abuse . Paulo Pinto , bassist for the Brazilian thrash metal band Sepultura and Overlord Of International Metal Affairs , suggested that the hand of a suspected signer should be immediately cut off . A contingency of death rockers from Gothenburg , Sweden recommended that any sign abuser , or anyone who is not sufficiently metal , should be forced to eat his severed hand while having his eyeballs burned with a superheated metal crucifix , and then be slowly skinned alive .
