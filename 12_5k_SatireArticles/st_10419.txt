" Listen people , " blared Lorne Michaels voice over the bullhorn . " Everybody remain calm . We ' ll have you down on the first floor to your awaiting ambulances to transport you to the best medical care New Jersey has to offer , because nothing is too good for my writers . Unfortunately , due to the recession and by that I mean Obama being elected president and now Sarah Palin quitting politics some of you will not be back next season . So you might as well say your goodbyes now . "
