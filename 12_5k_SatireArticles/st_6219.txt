" As an individual , I emphatically support stopping in the name of love , " Justice Ross said in her five page written dissent . " However , I believe it is a states ' rights issue and should not be legislated from the highest offices . Additionally , it should be noted that the so called ' love ' referred to in this instance has already been wasted and , in fact , may have been nothing more than a handful of promises . Therefore , I believe it is imprudent to waste further tears on reflections of the way life used to be , reflections of the love you took from me . "
