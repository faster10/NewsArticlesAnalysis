" Mr Graves , I find that you are nothing more than a common nuisance . I have asked my clerk to verify the existence of ' Stupid Schoolboy Syndrome ' , and the results have come back , surprisingly , that there is no such malady , and its invention was a ploy by Ms Grabbit to better your defence . Basically you are bordering on being plain juvenile , and this type of behaviour , if it ever happens again , will result in a custodial sentence . Do you understand me Mr Graves "
