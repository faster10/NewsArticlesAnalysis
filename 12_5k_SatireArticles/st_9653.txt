Rep . Peter T . Clown ( R . N . Y . ) , who has constantly blasted Obama for the excessive use of Presidental powers , said , " Let Obama go to war . Maybe we can vote after an American pilot crashes over there . The American people would support war after they see American blood , not foreign dead women and children killed by our bombs at wedding parties . If we vote now it might stir up some Libertarians in my district and hurt my election chances . I oppose a vote on the war for now . "
