While Warner Bros . executives are reportedly happy with the shape the script is in , they said it would receive one final last minute rewrite from screenwriters Scott Frank and Steven Kloves , as well as a polish from veteran writer William Goldman , who drafted a full rewrite of the script in 1966 when it was being conceived as a buddy picture for Robert Redford and Paul Newman , and did so again when it was being considered as a possible California Raisins claymation feature film in 1989 .
