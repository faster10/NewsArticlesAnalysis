Up to now , only the 1972 Albanian Open final has witnessed a marsupial shoot out , when the Pitkin Arena hosted a promising match up between a plucky under marsupial Red Necked Wallaby and the odds on favourite American Virginia Opossum . In a sensational turn up for the books , the wallaby ran out , or rather hopped out , the winner in straight sets . His success was short lived , however , as he lost his next match , a first round tie in the Paraguayan Open , to Nastase . The sparse crowd were treated to the unedifying spectacle of Nastase making fun of the hapless pouched mammal by hopping about the court with his arms held to his chest . The match was a walk over , or rather a hop over , and the wallaby was never seen again .
