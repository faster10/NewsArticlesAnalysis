When reached for comment , Vatican officials confirmed that sightings of a feral Ratzinger lurking in hidden corners of the holy city date back to March 2013 , shortly after the inauguration of Pope Francis . Around that time , according to reports , the Swiss Guard pursued the one time Vicar of Christ after he was caught trying to steal a crucifix topped staff and other items of papal regalia belonging to his successor , though they were said to have quickly lost his trail when the pale , shriveled figure retreated down a narrow drainpipe .
