The expensive emblem crested blue blazer , open white silk shirt with a gold chain across a deeply tanned chest , starched white deck pants and worn looking deck shoes without socks are his ' official ' uniform when on the prowl . Some even say expensive cologne instead of mere mortal blood runs through his veins . Of course , he drinks sweaty cold Dos Equis beer , or 200 year old tawny Port , and he loves to eat in the world ' s most celebrated restaurants , and of course , he never eats or sleeps alone .
