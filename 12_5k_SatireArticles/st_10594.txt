UTICA , N . Y . Harvard President Lawrence H . Summers , who created a firestorm when he suggested two weeks ago that biological differences between the sexes may explain why fewer women succeed in math and science careers , now wants Harvard to stop offering " those kinds of degrees " to women altogether . Speaking at a Promise Keepers rally in Utica , New York , last night , Summers declared : " Women who pursue studies in math or science would be better served and so would our nation if they studied home economics or language arts instead . Therefore , I plan to recommend at the next faculty council meeting that Harvard take the lead in education once again by barring women from math and science programs beginning with the 2006 2007 academic year .
