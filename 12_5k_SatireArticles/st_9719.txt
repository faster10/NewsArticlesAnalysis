The gray haired rattlesnake can sick the men in black on me . Ditto for the Navy SEALS and even the Daughters of the American Revolution . I don ' t give a cluck . If you ask me , a newly elected township trustee in the most remote area of Nowheresville USA could do a much better job as a U . S . Senator than this overly glorified charlatan . He ' s a thief , a con man , and his performance as a U . S . Senator has been abysmal . All his role has been for years now is that of the Republican Senators ' snapping and snarling guard dog . His actions , reactions , and duties as a federal representative for the people of Arizona have spelled failure . And what ' s going to become of the copper mine ? What will McCain and Gosar do if the water and land around the Apache reservation become so polluted that their land grab deal results in a threat to human life and welfare ? I don ' t think either of these guys care about the common people of Arizona . Their only alliances are to the wealthy and to special interests that they ' re involved with , yes indeed .
