" I feel that people should be able to do what they want to do on the road , just like cowboys , " confided the President . " All this crap about drive 55 and save lives is a lot of hooey . In an accident , the person who has the biggest , most gas guzzling car wins . It ' s simple as that . When your neightbor buys a big car , you gotta buy a bigger one . That ' s good for the economy , too . "
