When the founding fathers said that government should not prohibit the free exercise thereof , they were stating that government was not allowed to physically arrest an establishment of religion , to stop them from practicing . The founding fathers didn ' t contradict themselves when they barred government from aiding religion . Churches can run for profit , private corporations similar to the retail giant Wal Mart and they could use their billions of dollars in profits to fund their religious activities . They have billions in tax free dollars they have saved and they can use that money as investment capital .
