Michelle ' s snub also has experts wondering if all is well in the White House or if repeated rumors of Presidetial mischief ( which are quickly squashed by the media ) have finally hit home . Said Hedda Taylor of Washington Insider , " Michelle knows which side of the toast her bread is buttered on . She knows that she still has to kiss this man , even if he has kept women in local apartments since his Senate Days . She knows that if she dumps his cheating ass , there will be no more trips to Europe of lavish gifts of jewelry , clothes , or furs . She will put up with this until after the election ( if her husband loses ) or for four more years ( if he wins ) . If she can manage to turn this into a Hillary Clinton type marriage , she might stay . Otherwise , I ' d expect her to be bouncing the headboards with some other guy before the next election season . "
