The design of the unit is as follows : standard domestic wiring of the day was used , 6 closely coupled cables were attached at points to special ceramic plates about 4 " square around the inside of the conservatory on the exterior wall . Each ceramic plate had a specially designed form of socket that was used in conjunction with additional Frequency Induced Self Heaters . The design of socket avoided accidental use by any other device of the day . The Heaters were normally only needed only in the coldest of weathers . They comprised of a ceramic plate about 24 " by 12 " with 18 mutually inductively wound air spaced coils of copper in a single layer . The coils were about 3 " in diameter and 4 " in height . A protective guard was placed over the unit . Each Unit could be plugged directly into the socket and locked in place . It is believed that there were different sizes of heater but only the specification for the 24 " x12 " one is known of .
