The 17 ton , four foot thick wall was built by Daytona Speedway construction personnel , with the cost partially covered by a million dollars in fan donations and the balance paid by former Earnhardt sponsor General Motors Goodwrench Service Inc . On Sunday , after the national anthem and the call to start engines , it will be maneuvered by crane into position , 15 feet in the air , at a point halfway between Turn 4 and the Daytona start finish line . Following the pace lap , the crane will lower the wall into place , and on the first green flag lap , the entire field will race toward the monument at full speed .
