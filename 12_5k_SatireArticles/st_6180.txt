According to Sudanese psychologist Jibal al Muglad , Malakai ' s behavior is not unusual . " Many middle aged Sudanese males , usually around the age of 14 or so , start reverting to the behavior of their youth , " al Muglad says . " Largely , this is done to counter oncoming signs of middle age , such as increased height or a cracking voice . Much of this behavior is harmless , but other manifestations can put a strain on a marriage , especially if the man becomes wistful for the sexual freedom of his youth . "
