" The steady ' alert ' siren indicates the need to be generally aware of the threat of terrorism , " he said . " This is the normal , default siren . The higher pitched ' wail ' siren , on the other hand , means federal authorities have credible information regarding a specific possible threat , and that citizens should ready themselves for the 30 to 50 percent likelihood of an attack . If citizens hear an ' alternating wail ' siren , a piercing shriek whine interrupted every 30 seconds by short bursts of what sounds like gunfire , they need to prepare for the 70 percent chance of a 20 percent more serious disaster . And , finally , a ' pulsating steady ' alarm means Americans should have plenty of plastic sheeting and duct tape on hand to make a shelter in the almost guaranteed event of chemical , biological , or radiological attack .
