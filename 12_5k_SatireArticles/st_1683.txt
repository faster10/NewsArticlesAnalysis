" The average weight of a Cubs fan is between 375 and 425 pounds , " team president Theo Epstein said in the statement , adding that while there are still a few fans whose weight does not prevent them from attending games , there aren ' t nearly enough to fill the seats , because all of them are tourists . " One person filling up two or three seats throughout the entire bleacher section is not a sustainable business model . And we don ' t have enough room to accommodate all of our fans ' motorized scooters . "
