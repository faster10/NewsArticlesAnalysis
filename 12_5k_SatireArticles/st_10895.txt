" We are now powering Tokyo with that smell , " Miss Inoue coyly remarks as she removes her neat blue gloves at an exit . There are huge generators in the room next door , newly installed by Mitsubishi . Each 500 megawatt electric turbine is run by steam produced by burning the whale oil and fish parts . The goal is to do all of this in secret and to let the government take the blame for the nuclear fictions that TEPCO told the public . " We love it when the politicians take the blame for our mistakes , but this time we are trying to atone for the lies . TEPCOW is going to supplant the nuclear tragedy by using the whale , which people here are endeared to . When we are finished building this plant , we will be producing about 18 of the energy needs of Japan , and about 40 of Tokyo ' s . " That amount is close to being able to replace the dozens of nuclear plants that TEPCO had to shut down .
