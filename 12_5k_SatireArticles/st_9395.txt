Why has the name Dan Quayle been unmentioned until now ? One point Rather emphasizes : the vice president did mention Quayle . " From the beginning Dick Cheney , I call him Dick , said he was shooting Quayle . We in the media spelled it quail , not him . He never wrote down a word . He ' s real smart about that kinda stuff . " Also , Rather reports Quayle was hurried from the scene by the current vice president ' s Secret Service detachment , who were performing their duty to " protect the vice president , " in this case from himself . If you think that a shooting accident is bad press , imagine what the media would have done with attempted homicide ?
