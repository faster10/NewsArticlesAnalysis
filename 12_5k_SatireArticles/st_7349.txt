" The ordinary , everyday person is wholly unqualified to decide what music they like much less what music they should hear , " said Jack Isquith , Executive Director of Music Industry Relations at AOL Music . " We are highly paid professionals they are rank amateurs . The arrogance of the everyday person who thinks that he can just walk into a CD shop or hop on Amazon , listen to few snippets of music and tell from that what he likes is appalling . " " That ' s our job , " said Isquith , " and the last seventy five years of music sales and record industry profits have proven we knew what we are doing . "
