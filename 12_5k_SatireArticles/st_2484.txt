" Cloning human beings and using various intimidation tactics to coerce the genetic duplicates to battle inside a craggy , dimly lit arena certainly raises numerous ethical questions , but the benefits of cheap , incredibly exciting , blood drenched brawls outweigh potential violations of moral principles , " biologist Richard K .
