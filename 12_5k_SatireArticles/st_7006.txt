" You will not be laughing , " Dearden said . " It will not be a big game . There will not be cotton candy or balloons . Or any happy little elves singing ' It ' s A Small World . ' And Hell never closes , kids . It ' s open all night , every night until the end of all time . You won ' t be going back to the hotel with your family and watching HBO . There ' s no TV in Hell , and the Devil and all the demons with tongues of fire and hooves for feet will be your new family . "
