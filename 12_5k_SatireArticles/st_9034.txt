" Everyone was having a great time at the barbecue until Donnie started running low on meat for the guests , " explained Calipso . " Next thing you know , he comes out , wheeling a huge wheelbarrow piled up with dead birds . There ' s peacocks , parrots , sparrows , crows and all sorts on there . Donnie just slumps this huge rotting swan carcass onto the barbecue and invites everyone to tuck in . Some girl screamed and said she was going to call the police and so Donnie just grabs the swan ' s body by the head and tosses it over his neighbour ' s fence like some Olympic thrower . "
