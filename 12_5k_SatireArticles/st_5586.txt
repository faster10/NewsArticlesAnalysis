" The best part is , it ' s really easy to lie , " said Romney , who added that voicing whatever untruths come into his mind at any given moment is an easy thing to do because all it requires is opening his mouth and talking . " For example , if someone accuses me of having a tax plan that makes no discernible sense , I just lie and say that I do have a tax plan that makes sense . I also say there is a study that backs up my plan . See that ? Simple . None of it is remotely true , of course , but now we ' re moving on to the next topic because people are usually too afraid to ask me straight up if I ' m lying , because that is apparently not something you ask someone who is running for president .
