" I really think it would ' ve gone off without a hitch if we didn ' t hitch the whole blasted thing onto that stupid fish ! It was a coterie of Navy Admirals that came up with this bright idea . They ' ve been spending a lot of time and money trying to train these groupers and flounders to be deep water sailors . Suicide bombers . Strap explosives to their fins and train them to head straight into Al Quaeda submarines . It ' s been triple top secret . All this is off the record . Anyhow , blame the Navy , not me !
