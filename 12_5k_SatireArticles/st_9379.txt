When questioned , President Obama briefly stated , " People don ' t enjoy the moment they live in to the fullest anymore because they ' re too consumed viewing the moment through their cameras and posting to social media sites . If this country wants to move forward , we have to focus on bettering the individual and our values , a belief that has propelled this bill forward for the good of the nation . Just because we have the technology , doesn ' t mean it ' s good . Americans need to reevaluate their values if we want to be productive as a whole . "
