The sleepy town of Blackwood in Wales was in shock today as one of it ' s fire fighting heroes , Simon Bevman , was strangled to death in the high street by a 15ft python . Initial reports indicate that Mr Bevman had just left the chemist after buying a large bottle of baby oil and a Rampant Rabbit , when without warning the snake appeared from under his fireman ' s coat and throttled the poor man to death on the pavement in front of screaming , terrified shoppers .
