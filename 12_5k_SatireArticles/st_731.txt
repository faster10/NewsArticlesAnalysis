At several points throughout the evening , those in attendance assumed Girard had ceased partying and gone home . Though everyone thought Girard had left , a small group arriving at the party shortly after midnight discovered him lying behind a shrub in the front of the house . When they woke him , Girard reportedly jumped up " like a leopard or something " and ran into the house . A few hours later , Girard was seen taking a bicycle from a neighbor ' s garage and pedaling down the street , yelling out that he was going to go for a swim and that his collarbone was fine .
