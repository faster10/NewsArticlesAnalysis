So , why ' cougar ' ? Nobody really knows for certain exactly where or when the term was first coined , although there are many prominent theories . The vast majority trace the word back to the character of Samantha on Sex and the City , which was seen as the first true ' cougar ' on television . Nowadays , popular newcomers such as the aptly named ABC sitcom , Cougar Town , are making a strong bid for the credit of spreading the fiery term . While the exact origins may remain clouded in mystery , what is for certain is the big cats had absolutely nothing to do with the choosing of the name .
