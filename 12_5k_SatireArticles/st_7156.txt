SAPP attempted to contact multiple gun makers prior to the publication of this story . All but one had no comment . Here is the response we received from the maker of an assault rifle similar to the AR 15 : " President Obama is the world ' s best gun salesman ever . He sold more guns in seven years than were confiscated by Turkey , the Soviet Union , the UK , Germany , China , Guatemala , Uganda , Cambodia , Rwanda , Australia , and Canada . . . combined ! While we cannot respond to any of the specific details , it is our intent to ask the President to join our team on the day he leaves office . We understand that our offer will not be the only one . He can basically write his own blank check at this point . The big question is whether he will sign an exclusive deal or not . "
