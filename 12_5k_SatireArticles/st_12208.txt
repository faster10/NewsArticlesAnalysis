A remote controlled aircraft owned and operated by another nitwit animal rights group called SHARK , was reportedly shot down near Broxton Bridge Plantation , South Carolina , on Sunday . The drone was sent up to harrass the hunters and to scare game birds away from what was a legal hunt with licensed hunters participating . Steve Hindi , president of SHARK ( SHowing Animals Respect and Kindness ) , said his group was preparing to launch its Mikrokopter drone to video what he called a live pigeon shoot on Sunday when law enforcement officers and an attorney claiming to represent the privately owned plantation near Ehrhardt tried to stop the aircraft from flying .
