Do you need a lot of expensive equipment and a talent agent ? Hell no . All you need to do is go down to your local airport or bus station and make them an offer on that old sound system they used to use back in the ' 60 ' s to make announcements throughout the vacuous , amorphous structure . Make them an offer they can ' t refuse . Chances are , they keep all that sound gear in the basement of the building . It hasn ' t been used in eons , and it ' s taking up the space they want to now earmark for the outdated computer system they just ditched . Just tell these business types that you ' ll be happy to take that crappy old monstrosity off their hands for twenty bucks . And if they look desperate and pleading , just throw a ten dollar bill their way .
