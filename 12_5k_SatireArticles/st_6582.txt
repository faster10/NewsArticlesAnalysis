" Repeated use of antibiotics will result in increased resistance to antibiotics in new strains of bacteria , " said Carl Pickney , lab researcher for TriCon Global , the fast food conglomerate that owns KFC , Taco Bell , and Pizza Hut . " That ' s why we need to encourage our meat suppliers to continually raise the levels of antibiotics in their meat , developing newer , stronger antibiotics to replace those that no longer work . We ' re making good progress , but we ' ve still got a whole lot of meat to modify . "
