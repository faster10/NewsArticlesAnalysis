" The messages in the YesScriptures are rarely clear and almost always of questionable morality , " said Michael Fox , chair of Yale University ' s Divinity School . " While Christ ' s message may seem obvious when , in Howe 3 : 16 , He sayeth unto James the Lesser : ' Owner of a lonely heart , yea , much better than thee , O owner of a broken heart , ' it is possible that this passage contains intended irony on the part of the Savior , and that the verse actually signifies a message of profound sympathy for the broken hearted heart owners of Mankind .
