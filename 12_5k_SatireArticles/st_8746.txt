' We are not stupid , ' said a spokesperson for the lay members of the General Synod . ' We realise that , for the safety of our congregations , laws other than just gravity will need to be reviewed . It is very cold in space , there is nothing to breathe , and the upper atmosphere is being constantly bombarded by deadly radiation . Many old laws will have to be revised , and new ones created , in order that large numbers of the faithful can successfully enter orbit and then return safely to their churches . '
