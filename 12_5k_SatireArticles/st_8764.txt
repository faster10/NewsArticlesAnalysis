' The law in relation to peramburovers will , of course , be as important as the design of the vehicles , themselves , ' explained Sergeant Fred Peddler , police advisor to the NRSA . ' Anyone of any age will be able to easily own one , and there will be no requirement for any training or licensing whatsoever before driving one on the busiest of major roads . There will also be no compulsory safety equipment required by the driver , in any form . There may be a few laws made about roadworthiness , such as lights for use at night , ' he added . ' We will ensure , however , that all these laws are virtually unenforceable and any penalties are derisory . Driving an unroadworthy peramburover completely naked in rush hour traffic while listening to music through headphones , filling in a crossword and swigging gin might lead to a caution for indecent exposure , but no legal action would be likely in relation to road safety .
