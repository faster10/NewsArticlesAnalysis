Lawyer Derek Gadd , from Notting Hill , a member of the party since 1998 and a veteran of one party conference , spoke of his delight that he could help reconstruct the shattered islands . " Blackpool doesn ' t need our help . It ' s charmingly olde worlde crumbling guest houses and rusty trams are a testament to the surviving strength of our great British heritage . Our seaside resorts are thriving , it ' s not as if they need our help in the Autumn . The palm fringed golden beaches of The Maldives really do need our patronage though , and I for one will be on the first plane in , and the last plane out , to help . "
