K . prime minister David Cameron over how cool as shit it is to know that they both will be written about in history books and encyclopedias for hundreds of years to come . " Like the rest of the attendees here , I can declare a national state of emergency and have tanks on the streets in a matter of hours . I can spend taxpayer money on whatever I want . Hell , I can make tomorrow Vladimir Putin Day if I really feel like it . "
