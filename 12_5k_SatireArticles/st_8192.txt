Well further experiments ensued , and with the timely development and introduction of the latest thermionic devices ( UK valves , US tubes ) in what was seen as a pioneering circuit , Mr de Corset produced a unit with no moving parts which gave an output of electrical frequency energy that was both variable in power and rate with up to 5 selectable frequencies ( 100KHz , 160KHz 250KHz , 360KHz and 500KHz ) , which could be sequentially turned on to provide increased levels of ' invisible , smoke and smut free heating for the plant collector ' . The supply to the Unit could be either AC or DC ' mains ' .
