" Our vegetarian entr es and meal starters are the most authentically meat like available on the market , because we make sure our soybeans are raised in filth caked , overcrowded growing troughs in a windowless facility where daytime temperatures regularly exceed 120 degrees , " said Greenwood Farms marketing director Michael Latimer , adding that the beans ' rich , savory flavor is enhanced by the unsanitary conditions and the regular spread of disease and infection through the crop . " We also make sure our soybeans are pumped so full of a variety of powerful hormones and antibiotics that their growth is boosted far beyond what the plants are capable of naturally , giving our product the same delectable consistency as meat you find at your local grocery store .
