The bank was first spoken of in a book by Klaus Greenbach , Joseph Goebbels ' s personal secretary who claimed that shortly before the invasion of Berlin by Russian troops he had been called to the F hrerbunker where he had been informed by Hitler that the accumulated wealth confiscated from Jewish prisoners , especially such articles that were made of gold , had been hidden away in an underground cave in the Swiss Alps . " There is enough gold there , " the Fuhrer told him , " to finance the Fourth Reich that Stalin , Roosevelt , Churchill and myself have decided to call The New World Order . " Klaus was given a map of its location in Switzerland and ordered to go there with the " Architect of the Reich " , Albert Speer . Speer and his team had already spent considerable time designing the underground fortress with its numerous vaults and offices . Unfortunately , Speer was arrested and sentenced in the Nuremberg trials to 20 years in Spandau Prison leaving Klaus to undertake the building of the bank alone from Speer ' s drawings . In his memoirs of course , Speer never alludes to the bank , his most important project , because at heart , despite his remorse , he was always a loyal Nazi .
