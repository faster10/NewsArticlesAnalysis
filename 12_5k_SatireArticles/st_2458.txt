" Our lives revolve around the factory , " said Obsidia McDobbs , head slip stitcher at the plant . " Every morning at eight o ' clock we leave our little cottages , take the Toot Toot Trolley to Topper ' s , fashion all manner of beautiful and delicate doilies , picnic out of doors on cold chicken and mincemeat pie , return to the factory to work some more , close down shop at three o ' clock , and ride home on the Toot Toot Trolley to our little cottages , where we tend to our flower gardens and play accordions on our front porches .
