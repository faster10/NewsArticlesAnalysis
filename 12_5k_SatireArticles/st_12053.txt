Said White House Press Secretary Jay Blarney ( sic ) , " the President is not showing partiality on his vacation sites . He did look at the White Mountains , but decided he ' s wait till they change its name . He wanted to try Vermont , but Bernie Sanders hasn ' t been able to rename downtown Rutland " Red Square " yet . Newark has too many brothers and no money , Detroit looks like Beirut , and California is way to gay , even for him . Forget Texas , Arizona , and Utah . too many Christian Zealots ! "
