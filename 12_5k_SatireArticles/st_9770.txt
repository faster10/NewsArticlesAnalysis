Mrs Voortface claims that the waterfalls are major nuisances being marketed to an unsuspecting public as natural wonders . " Some vacation ! The roar ! I thought Yellowstone was going to be much quieter , " said Mrs Voortface . " I never expected this . And the geysers ! Gush , gush , gush , all day long . Don ' t even get me started on the visitors to the park : children with their squeals of delight , grandparents with their gasps of admiration . How can anyone enjoy the beauty of the planet with so much noise ? That ' s something I ' ve always hated : the noise , noise , noise ! "
