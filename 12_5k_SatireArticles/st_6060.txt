" Uncle Gonzo isn ' t like my other uncles , who just talk about work all the time and won ' t let us make noise in the house , " said Brad Dornheim , 8 , who , like his siblings and cousins , is unaware of his uncle ' s marijuana use . " He makes us these awesome banana smoothies . And he has the coolest backyard , with these robot bird sculptures he made out of scrap metal . He even gave me one , but Mom said it has to stay in the garage . I want to be just like him when I grow up . Uncle Gonz rules ! "
