" I ' ve also offered my jockstrap for testing since it ' s my lucky playoff one and I never wash it . It helped me win the world series MVP when I was with the Arizona D ' backs and so it has sweat from a couple of playoff runs . My wife wants it out of the house anyway , because she said that it turns the air blue . Right now , it ' s triple bagged in ziplocs and in a storage shed close to the dump so you can ' t tell it smells . Guys in the locker room don ' t mind , because , well , that smells like a locker room . "
