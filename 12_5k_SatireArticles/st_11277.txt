Mar . 8 : Dear Diary . Today I woke up to find that Hassim had wandered off into the desert with the camel and the goats . the chicken had made a nest out of our latest carefully planned strike and that Akmed was not back from Radio Shack yet . I am at my wit ' s end . I think I will climb down the mountain and see if Mary What ' e Her Name is still down there and if the makeover offer is still good . My plan is to get the makeover , buy a suit and head for America . I have heard that anyone in America can have a radio talk show . I have been able to pick up American radio shows off the satellite and have listened to radio shows by Dr Laura , Rush Limbaugh and some one called Springer so I know that is true . If I cannot achieve my ends from the outside I will do it from the inside .
