The CCU was created in 2004 in response to the lack of terror activity since the Sept . 11 attacks . Its main tasks include raising awareness among the American public of the " myriad unknown threats " that still face the country , while also testing the readiness and effectiveness of the nation ' s counterterrorism program by exposing agents to real world scenarios . Last winter , the eight man Counter Counterterrorism Unit was prevented from blowing up the Statue of Liberty and from releasing deadly sarin gas at a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game . But sources within DHS said they believed CCU ' s months of planning and reconnaissance paid off in the latest exercise .
