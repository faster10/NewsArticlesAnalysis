George refers to the fact that after he had watched " Pretty Woman " , he had read countless novels and seen countless movies , all in which the theme of the " Hooker With The Heart Of Gold " was prominent . " Where was my Belle Watley ? Where was my Vivian Ward ? Heck , I ' d even have settled for V , played by that overaged has been Melanie Griffith ! " , whined George . " But hey , I have to cut this short . The line for getting a free shirt and pair of pants is forming up , and I need to get something nice . I ' ve a job interview tomorrow at McDonalds , my PO arranged it for me . Say , have you met Angie over in the Women ' s Section ? I met her last night and told her my story , and she said that if I get the job , she ' ll let me take her out to dinner when I get my first paycheck ! Now there ' s a sweet woman , I think she really does have a heart of gold ! "
