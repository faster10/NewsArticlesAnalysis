Andrew Basiago is able to provide evidence of himself as a child present at The Gettysburg Address and was actually walking in the muddy encampment and able to see the squalid conditions the men were living in . He claims that Barry Soetoro was embraced by Lincoln as " The chosen one , who was born over a hundred years from now . " Basiago treasures a Lincoln penny which he found in the mud of the battlefield . Sometimes he muses about how he was present when history was being made and wonders why he had not been selected by DARPA to be the future President of the United States of America .
