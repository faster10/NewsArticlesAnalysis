Amanda Holden , star judge on the BGT show , clapped her hands together in glee ( with the fingers pointing out ) at the prospect of judging the meaty athletes , then sank in despair when told of Cowell ' s choice of panel . After a bout of retail therapy at the North London ' s Brent Cross Shopping Centre , she was later seen at the start line for the 100m at the nearby Copthall Stadium running track . It was here , years ago and with the help of many boxes of kleenex that Amanda honed her very own special brand of tearful and sympathetic ' I just so know what you ' re going through ' routines .
