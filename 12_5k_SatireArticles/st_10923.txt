Technicians had to extinguish the flame for the move and it was to be re lit using the backup Olympic flame . As during the opening ceremony , David Beckham was to deliver the flame by a speedboat . According to the leaked news , Beckham had an accident only meters before reaching the stadium and he capsized the boat . Although no one was hurt , the Olympic flame ended in the River Thames . Recklessly , Beckham took the original backup without leaving any additional emergency flame behind . British organizers informed Greek officials about the situation and sent David Beckham , accompanied by the Special Boat Service , to bring the Olympic flame back to London and light the cauldron .
