The doctor did explain that some activities do seem to increase life expectancy , " moderate exercise and a sensible diet do seem to prolong the inevitable , but not to the degree that i would suggest them to someone who has more fun sitting on the couch watching Family Feud while downing cheese curls and Mellow Yellow . Also , notice that exercising too much or following an extreme diet just seem to make you dead quicker . Even exercising and eating right are just time sucks that leave you that much closer to death . Every activity that you do is just another tick on your personal doomsday clock , whether you believe what you are doing is good for you or not . The best you can hope for is being able to say , " I ' m not dead yet . " " the doctor expounded .
