" It stands to reason that a large scale mail order company would attract broken individuals , " Wesleyan University sociologist Dr Jonathan Kinnard said . " But beyond that , we see that the typical pathetic loser is well suited to perform the repetitive and unchallenging tasks required by phone reception . Sitting in the same bare cubicle , repeating the same 10 lines from a script for 40 hours a week , every week with no vacation , would psychologically break a healthy person with any sort of zest for life . But the dead eyed invertebrates of the world would be hard pressed to think of a better job . Pet stores are filled with unfamiliar sights and smells , driving a vehicle carries too much responsibility , and libraries contain books . With phone sales , you ' ve got your workspace that ' s not too small or too big , and you ' ve got your phone and your script . It ' s perfect . "
