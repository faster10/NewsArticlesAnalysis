" When I was growing up , my dad always flew the American flag with a Hardee ' s flag right alongside it , and I do the same thing , " U . S . Rep . Joe Wilson ( R SC ) said . " It ' s part of my heritage , and I have to honor that . When I see those Hardee ' s colors flapping in the wind , I know it ' s a testament to the very freedom America stands for . "
