Mr Peddle explained the origin of the argument to our reporter Ava Dayoff . " The missus had been getting on at me all morning . Do this , do that . I was proper fed up . Anyway , I ' d settled down with a cup of tea and some crumpets looking forward to watching a bit of snooker . Then the missus came in and started moaning that she wanted to watch one of those bloody shopping channels . She ' s cost me a chuffin ' fortune with those things . "
