" I don ' t ordinarily dance , but Warren dragged me out to do the Chicken Dance , " said Eileen Swearingen , 76 , the bride ' s great aunt . " Well , that was fine , but after that song ended , a very dirty one came on . I couldn ' t make out all the words , but at one point , the man sang , ' When I start makin ' love , I don ' t just make love I be strokin ' . ' I tried to get off the dance floor and back to my table , but I could barely fight my way through the crowd . It was awful . "
