Obama himself was obviously referring to the Government Motors ( GM ) fiasco where the stock has dropped way below it ' s opening despite CEO Obama offering ' fire sale ' prices on his signature models , the Chevy Dolt ( sic ) and Chevy Cruize , two ill conceived cars that are burning up in people ' s garage , but not the sales charts ! The Dolt was bought by Liberals in California to the tune of 603 units in January , hardly enough to keep the factories churning out the vehicles predicted to pay for themselves after only 12 . 7 years ! That ' s Government Accounting for you under the Obama mandate of " Hope ' n Charge ! " not to mention charging at Wind Mills .
