" It ain ' t gonna be easy , " Parker said . " I must ' ve cased the joint with Kelp a million times . I had two specialists drive down from Dayton with a truck full of fancy equipment to sweep the place for bugs . I got the best roofer in the business , Big Beef Manzo , checking the shingles . And , if things get down and dirty , I just call in Joe The Cleaner to have a little talk with the client . He ' ll clean the place up nice . "
