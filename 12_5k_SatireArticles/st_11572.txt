The U . S . military command in Iraq cordoned off the mosque where the attempted assassination of Allawi took place , and forensic experts are examining the many " ambulatory projectiles " ( which is military parlance for " thrown shoes " ) still strewn across the floor of the deserted mosque . In a more recent development , several hundred barefoot men have been arrested in the streets of Najaf , and U . S . Secretary of Defence Donald Rumsfeld has indicated that some of these suspected enemy combatants may be sent to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba for further interrogation . Responding to Congressional critics who are suggesting such an action may be " overkill " , Rumsfeld warned that , although the existence of the projectiles is not quite a " smoking gun " , they do fit the category of " stinking shoe " . He went on to say that investigators suspect that the seized shoes have been secretly made in Iran and Syria and supplied to arch terrorists such as Abu Musab Zaqarwi in Iraq . If this is the case , he says , Coalition forces have not ruled out taking appropriate action . " We will cut the insurgency off at the knees wherever we have to go . "
