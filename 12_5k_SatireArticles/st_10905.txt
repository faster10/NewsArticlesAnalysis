Noted industrialist , former actor and current owner of the IPL Team Karbon Kamal Kanchipuram DLF Cement Fighters , Mr Shekar Raj Kapur often referred to by his trademarked nickname , SRK K K Boiling rallied his one time colleagues to the cause . " If there are no blogs , " he thundered from behind the walls of his bungalow , " no FakeIPLPlayer , no websites to see me flex my muscles at a security guard and no places to post photoshopped images of my bod , there is no SRK ! There is no Poonam Pandey ! There is no . . . oh , wait a minute , there is no need to bring Amitabh Bachan into this . " When reached for a rejoinder , SRK ' s long time bete noire Sul Mannkan ripped off his shirt and passed it to the heroine of his latest movie , Dabangg Gets Ready Part 7 . ( Incidentally , Ms Platinakshi Sinha is the daughter of Ms Sonakshi Sinha , who played Mannkan ' s elderly grandmother in DGR6 )
