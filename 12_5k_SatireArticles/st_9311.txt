" Why isn ' t that violence in Iowa or Kansas ? " asks Brafford Cruff , a gun enthusiast in Fready , Nebraska , who tries to buy at least one semi automatic gun every two months to be ready , he says , for when the United States government tries to take away Americans ' freedom . " I mean , mass carnage in Ixtapaluca is fine , and everything , but it ' s just wrong that our own federal government allows guns to flow out of this country . Do the Feds not think we can put these guns to good use against innocent people right here at home ? "
