Using the rubber as part of the visor sealing strip and inside the helmet ventilation as a baffle gave reduced noise levels of 86 dB ( A ) at 22 m s ( 50 mph ) and 93dB ( A ) at 36 m s ( 80 mph ) . There are also possibilities for producing ultra soft synthetic rubber ear plugs which have a specially sized hole inserted down the centre . The ultra soft synthetic rubber lining absorbs the high and low frequency sounds outside of the human hearing range and allows the normal vocal range 3 30 kHz to pass freely .
