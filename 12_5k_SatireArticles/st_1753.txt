" We were all very impressed that Leah volunteered to deliver the eulogy , since she ' d always been so shy at family gatherings , " said Natalie Demirdjian , Sawyer ' s aunt . " But at the funeral , she was very composed and she spoke so positively about her parents ' new life in heaven . She spoke movingly about how Hugh and Patricia had journeyed on to a place free of worries and hassles , where they would be ' forever young and without complaints . ' Then she described death as a way for the bereaved to start anew , and how ' bright flowers would bloom on scorched and sour earth . ' It was quite inspiring . "
