Congressional leaders expressed concern over the Justice investigation . " I ' m not saying the banks don ' t deserve a good slap on the wrists for this , " said a high ranking Republican . " But , we have to be cautious that we do not overreact to this situation and actually hurt the already fragile financial system . A reasonable fine , a few promises to reform their policies at an unidentified point in the future should be more than adequate in addressing this issue . Particularly when you consider how even handed the banks have been in the execution of this policy . Statistics show that over 85 if the murdered families have been ethnic minorities . A few hundred dead blacks and Hispanics ? That ' s like a weekend in Detroit . They don ' t vote for us anyway . Seriously , a few hundred people die every day in America chocking on chicken bones . I don ' t see anyone running around trying to sue chickens . "
