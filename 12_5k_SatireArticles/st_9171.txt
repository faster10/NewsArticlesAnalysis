" Well , you see , we currently have a 200 year plan for our liberation of Iraq , which will require a bit of funding . And then , of course , there are the other up and coming terrorist harbors including but not limited to Iran , Syria , North Korea , Tibet , Iceland , Canada , and the Galapagos Islands , which need to be attended to . Not to mention the one celled life forms on Jupiter ' s moon Europa , which we believe it prudent to nip in the bud before they get out of hand and wind up harboring Al Quaeda . The war on terrorism is far more wide reaching than most Americans realize . The president will stop at nothing to insure the safety of his fellow citizens , and if he has to personally travel to other planets to eliminate potential threats , then so be it . He is a man of the people . "
