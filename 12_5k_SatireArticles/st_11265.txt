While there was nothing new in content , the tone of the papal document distinguished itself by an unprecedented candor bordering on rudeness . On the subject of permitting Catholic women to enter the priesthood , the bull snorted that immodest demands made by " female screech owls who have built nests within the venerable institution of the Church " are as old as original sin . Not afraid to mix metaphors , it denounced " these insatiable wenches " as the true heirs of Eve , the first of all fallen women , and accused them of trying to shove more apples down the throats of Catholic menfolk . The clergy , it announced , had been instructed to conduct a merciless sanitation campaign to remove all traces of owls ' nests and droppings from their parish churches . " The stench of guano is an abomination before the Lord , " roared the bullish paper , " to say nothing of the revolting sight and scent of mushy , moldy , maggot infested apples picked from the forbidden tree of knowledge . " Women were advised to be content with the inferior but comfortable status the Lord had seen fit to assign to their kind . Those who persisted in clamoring for " equality with the gender in which Jesus chose to incarnate " would not only fail to achieve their goals , but would risk eternal damnation to boot .
