For she is the same as cameth into Alexandria and was crucified upon a wheel of which I had the vision : ( Biblical scholars say this clearly predicts the coming of Catherine of Alexandria of the 4th century , the first female Freemason and precursor of the one " named after a hill " . ) . Those that paid homage to Her Divinity bore the mark of the beast upon their foreheads that didst resemble the lightning sign of the priests of the Temple of Lloyds . "
