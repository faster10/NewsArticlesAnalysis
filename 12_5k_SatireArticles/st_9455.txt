Mr Fager has come under fire for a 60 minutes piece by correspondent Lara Logan in which she interviewed a supposed witness to a terrorist attack that killed four Americans at the U . S . embassy in Benghazi . In fact , the witness never left his " beachside villa " during the attack and was totally bullshitting when he told Ms . Logan he scaled the embassy wall and struck a terrorist with the butt of his rifle . Ms . Logan researched her story for more than a year but failed to check out the witness ' contrary statements to the FBI and his employer , though she knew these existed .
