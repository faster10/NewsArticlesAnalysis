People can come from nowhere , with modest backgrounds and very short r sum s , and yet be individuals maveriks of real gifts , gifts that had previously been unseen , that had been gleaming quietly under a bushel , and are suddenly revealed . Mrs Palin came , essentially , from nowhere . The WAGs have also come from nowhere and some might say heading nowhere . "
