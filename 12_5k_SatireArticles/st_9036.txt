Although conference delegates will have to give up their traditional creaky floored hotels , many of which have a rating of up to two RAC crowns , there has not been the expected outcry at the luxurious private island beachfront suites that have been provided instead . Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt said today that " although staying in five star luxury obviously betrays our working class heritage , it is a sacrifice I am willing to make to help . The tsunami destroyed everything here except for the beaches , flora and fauna , and many of the hotels . Without people like us , the tourist industry may never recover . " Foreign Secretray Jack Straw echoed these sentiments . " Having just been on a fact finding tour of the area , " said Mr Straw , " it was clear to me that we politicians must do everything in our power to help . As I gaze out across the ocean after my speech , sipping cocktails and wearing a grass skirt , I hope the islanders are grateful to me . Now , where did I put my suntan lotion ? "
