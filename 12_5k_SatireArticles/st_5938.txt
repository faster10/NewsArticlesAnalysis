" While it ' s true we are all sinners , that doesn ' t give us an excuse to live as wickedly as we please , " Whitlock said when reached for comment . " I ' ve known Jeff a long time . I ' ve had dinner at his house . I ' ve prayed with his family at their kitchen table . It unnerves me to think that right there in his lap , out of sight and inches away from me , Jeff might very well have been quietly sinning . Because even if no one else can see it , the Lord can .
