" The first time was amazing , " stated Doug Henderson . " The second time I try to block out of my memory , because I had such a bad experience . The park almost seemed like a soulless copy of itself . By the third time I visited Jurassic Park they had added a few more dinosaurs . I loved the Pterodactyls , but the Spionosaurus was just so goony looking . I know that it was bigger than a T Rex , but all I could think of was when Daffy Duck was turned into a neanderthal every time I looked at it . "
