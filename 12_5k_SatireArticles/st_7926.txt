Various theories were proposed to explain this discrepancy . Modified Newtonian Gravity ( or MONG ) that says gravity changes over distance in a proportional and not linear way , as Newton suggested .

Dark Matter was born , matter we can ' t see , because it ' s dark and space is dark . Scientists like this one , and went looking for what dark matter is .
