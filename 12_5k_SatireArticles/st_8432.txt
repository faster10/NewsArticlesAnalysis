Football has gone a little crazy in the last year or so with Leicester winning the title but there are some things in the Premier League that remain truly consistent . Life still has a feeling of normal around it when Arsenal approach a new season with their key centre halves out injured . Per Mertersacker has suffered a knee injury that is likely to keep him out for several months and rid him of that final yard of pace . With Gabriel down with poorly tonsils too Arsene ' s decision to let Koscielny have a long holiday after Euro 2016 seems inspired . No matter , there is always Callum Chambers and Rob Holding to ensure the Gunners top the table by the end of August .
