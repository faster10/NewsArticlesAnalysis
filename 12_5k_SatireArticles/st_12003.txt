Organized by radio host Melvin Lipshitz , a popular local talk show host who has over 2 . 5 million national listeners , the WKXY event was planned in response to several anti Christian events that happened to spark national outrage . First , was the recent theft of a forty foot cross from a war memorial in the desert by radical elements of a fundamentalist Arabic sect located in Enid , Oklahoma . Second , was the long simmering ACLU involvement with the City of Uhl vs Ali Baba case where the local mosque retaliated against the government sanctioned Christmas Manger scene located at City Hall . In protest the mosque erected its own manger scene on their front lawn , except the only props used were a full sized camel with what appeared to be a baby Jesus coming out of the camel ' s rectum . Local outrage prompted the court case which the City of Uhl lost , but the anger has persisted . The last outrage was the building of the Ali Baba mosque in a predominantly all Christian community . The location of the mosque is in the outlaying city limits of Uhl . Citizens were uncomfortable having burka clad women show up on Saturday morning , as well as the noise from the mosque ' s rifle and pistol range .
