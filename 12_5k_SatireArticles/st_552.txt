" I tried to tell them that I ' d just been robbed a few hours earlier , but I guess my accent still needs a little work , " Hayes said . " They took my money , of course , but they were really relaxed and mellow about it . I guess that ' s part of the chilled out Dutch vibe I ' ve heard so much about . Even the way that guy was holding his knife up to my throat felt totally I don ' t know European . "
