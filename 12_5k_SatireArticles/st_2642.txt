" The American people deserve to know that , of the two towers that were brought down in Lower Manhattan on 9 11 , only one was the target of the federal government , " said CIA spokesman Tom McLennan , emphasizing that their carefully guarded plot was a wholly independent event planned without any foreknowledge of the similar act of terrorism designed by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden for the same day . " While we freely admit our culpability in striking the first building , let us be clear that we had no hand in destroying the other tower . In fact , that was just as shocking and devastating to us as it was to all American citizens . "
