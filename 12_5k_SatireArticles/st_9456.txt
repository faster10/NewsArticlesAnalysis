Considering all they have been doing for decades is feigning concern for these " oppressed " minorities , thus creating widespread and fractious division and then subdivision and then divisiveness and then division on top of division , and then further subdivision , and then sub division , and then , just for good measure , some more division subdivision chucked in and further separating the two largest and most politically influential of these , the women and the blacks , from the remnant of America , by spearheading the political correctness initiatives that resulted , in time , in such trivial and traitorous and incremental things as " Black History Month , " and " Women ' s HERstory Month " . . . . thus forever creating unnecessary , untrue and unneeded division between American history and the black and female contributions to it and promoting all kinds of separatism , extremism and near treason , through lack of recognition and inclusion of those two groups ' rather significant contributions to the ongoing history of their country it hardly comes as no surprise that the Democrats , for nearly fifty years , have been manipulating and exploiting these two groups , misleading them via all manner of propaganda and outright lies , and creating a strong , but ultimately unsustainable electoral base for themselves and their party .
