These traitors wish to supplant their line from those who rightly claim it , " announced the gold headed King sitting atop the Iron Throne as he held court yesterday with his nubile bride to be , Margaery Tyrell , who expressed deep regret for Katherine ' s future loss and for the loss of these two great families .
