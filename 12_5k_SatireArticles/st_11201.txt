" I ' ve been practicing law for a long time , " former Jesus prosecutor Pontius Pilate said after the press conference , " and I don ' t think I ' ve ever felt worse than I did about the Jesus decision . Well , maybe the lashing and the crucifixion . Looking back , the punishment seems a bit harsh given the crime . But you have to remember , those were Biblical Times , baby : an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth , right ? Anyway , Jesus and I are good now . He had a little too much sacrificial wine one night and he got pulled over , but I knew the judge and I took care of it . So I guess bygones are bygones . Or at least I hope so . He ' s still got some pretty powerful friends , you know . "
