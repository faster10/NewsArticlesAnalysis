" We held a s ance in our living room , using a Ouija board to ask them questions , " John said . " We made contact , but rather than give us yes or no answers , they would blather on about how their daughter in Maine never calls or argue about the location of the good pot roast pan . After about 10 minutes , we felt one of the spirits leave the room to turn on the TV in the den and watch the PGA Masters . "
