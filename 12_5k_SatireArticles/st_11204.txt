When Dr Janice Fargo , vice president of NASA ' s Systemic Satellite Monitoring Division was asked what the mathematical implications were for the orbital schedule of billions of dollars of machines in space she replied " this is bullshit , I woke up this morning and it was hump day , now it ' s not ? What man ? " As she spoke at the podium of NASA ' s outdoor balcony a fiery object , later identified as a satellite , hurtled to the ground in the distance at a rapid speed . Its impact created a large explosion with a bright flash that lit up the evening sky in bright orange . Turning to the source of the commotion and back to the stunned audience of reporters Dr Fargo added " where was I ? Oh yeah , if they think I ' m working 6 days this week they got another thing coming "
