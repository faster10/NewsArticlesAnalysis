" The Steelers play the awful expansion Texans , so you ' d think I ' d have an easy time of it , " said Patek , who watches most Steelers games with friends at the Bluegill Bucket , a local tavern . " But in reality , having a big , fat target like Houston makes it tougher , because there ' s the temptation to resort to lazy , obvious jokes . I ' d be letting Dave , Graham , Carlos , Jeannie , Tucker , Christine , and all the rest down if I resorted to obvious stuff . When you ' re playing a team that ' s dead last in the NFL in total offense , you ' ve got to get pretty creative . "
