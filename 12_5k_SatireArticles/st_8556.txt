Wenger almost scored an own goal himself before the game by announcing another Englishman , Sol Campbell in the starting line up . ' Solomon was wearing a burka when he entered the changing room so I just assumed he was a player I had perhaps signed from maybe a French African colony and he was the first name down on the team sheet . It ' s a good job his mobile phone went off and he started speaking English otherwise I would have resigned there and then if he had walked on to the playing field . '
