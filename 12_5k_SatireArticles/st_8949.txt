However , reports from a representative of the Melbourne Age newspaper have suggesed that Mr Keegan was spotted on a beach on Nukulaelae , one of the Pacific Tuvalu Islands earlier today by an Australian tourist , a Mr Ray McCorran of Woomalloo : " This little bearded guy in sunglasses was shouting at me in a weird accent from inside a kind of little Wendy House on the edge of the beach just earlier there , asking if they played FOOTIE around here . I said I reckoned they favoured the old Rugger not the Footer and he seemed to calm right down straight off . Funny little geezer , about 4 foot tall with silvery hair , must have been a local . Some guys took him away later on . "
