What " Operation Switcheroo " consists of is merely turning the signs around along the borders that separate the USA from its southern and northern borders . So , if you ' re in the USA and are facing south , you ' d see signs saying things like " Limite de Los Estados Unidos de America " ( " US Border " ) or " Bienvenidos a los EEUU " ( " Welcome to the United States " ) . This takes care of Part 1 of the plan : getting the illegals out of the country . Not only will they leave willingly they ' ll be virtually impossible to stop , once they " realize " they hadn ' t actually made it all the way into the United States after all . And who are we to stop them , once they are on their way to what they are tricked into believing is the USA .
