Coach Stavros at Galatasaray football club has reluctantly confirmed this to be true , and revealed himself to be the creator of the Tigger Spirit Training Technique . He said he developed the method whilst watching Disney films at home with his children . This was when he became aware that his 3 year old son ' s energy levels were boosted 100 after just one 10 minute viewing session of the Stripy creation . His wife said that Tigger was a bad influence and made their son hyperactive , but Stavros saw the potential and he introduced the spirit of the Tigger to his training session .
