This barbaric notion of freedom is a totally erroneous and devastating falsehood . It needs to be eradicated from our society as soon as possible and an amendment defining it clearly be added to our Constitution . Crime we were taught by our parents does not pay . Only those who get caught say that . The rest who don ' t . . . and many of them have just now been led out of this House , ( jeers and shouting ) . . . they know full well it is the ONLY thing that pays . From the crooked lawyer , judge , accountant , senator , drug pusher and military mogul . . . ( boos and jeers . Another set to between reps erupts at the back of the hall with objects being hurled at the speaker . O ' Shea waits unperturbed until order is restored . ) .
