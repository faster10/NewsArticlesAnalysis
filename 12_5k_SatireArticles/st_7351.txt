" As a public service the BBC is mandated to reflect and take into account the makeup and attitudes of the licence holders it serves . Today I am pleased to announce a new TV channel dedicated to the good old days of the post war years of the 20th century when Britain was Great and it was every man and woman ' s right to contract polio and tuberculosis , to not be forced to eat continental breakfasts , to see a banana for the first time and for their children to play on bomb sites . The new channel will be called BBC Blighty . "
