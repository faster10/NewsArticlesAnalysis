Once the bouncers kicked me out , I walked over to the Lakeshore and barricaded the road with metal fencing and yelled : " Frosh spirit , suckas . " at all the cabbies who got out of their cars . Then I got a little lonesome , so I found a pylon and wore it on my head ( as a disguise ) to sneak back into the engineering party . It worked ! Everyone started calling me the " Pylon Man . " I got a lot of free drinks after that too many . I must have blanked out hard cause I woke up the next morning in a ditch . But that ' s what frosh is all about , my friends . I can ' t wait till next September comes around so I can do it all over again , for the eleventh time in a row .
