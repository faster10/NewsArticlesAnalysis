The Tomb itself is constructed of marble , but appearances can be deceptive . The foyer is papered with old newspapers and adorned with collector ' s edition photos of cracker heroes such as Dale Earnhardt , Charlie Daniels , and that guy who used to say " Hey , Vern ! " Visitors then walk through the Corridor of Crackerness , which features a replica of the still that claimed the life of the Unknown Cracker , an outhouse , and a life size statue of some redneck racecar driver who hasn ' t been freaking killed yet . Then visitors come to the Sanctuary itself , featuring the marble sarcophagus of the Unknown Cracker himself , carved in the likeness of your average , garden variety redneck , complete with an ill fitting , grease stained T shirt , jeans that come down below the crack of his ass , and an old NASCAR hat . The left cheek of the sarcophagus image is puffed out , as if the figure represented had himself a big ol ' chaw o ' terbacky .
