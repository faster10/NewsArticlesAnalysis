Rand says that Innards will restrict their main course menu to viscera , but Zimmern has convinced him that ventures into other unique cuisines could also prove profitable in a franchise , possibly even in a fast food arena . It would be a new area of operation for HIW , but Rand gets excited when he speaks of the potential . " We ' ll see it could happen . There is no one out there serving worms , bugs , slugs , or even penis on any kind of scale . These foods are staples in many parts of the world . Except for a few places in various Chinatown ' s , this market is virtually untouched in Europe and here in North America . Imagine pulling into your neighborhood drive through in your Bimmer or Volvo XC and ordering barbeque bull ' s penis on a sesame seed roll , with a side order of wine simmered banana slugs . It ' s not only healthy food , it is a rational way to minimize waste and thereby show respect for animals . "
