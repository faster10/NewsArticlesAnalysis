A mission planned by the American space agency NSA , called Darts , will fire stun probes into the asteroid to see if it can be persuaded by high voltage electric shocks to change course . However , this may not be openly permitted by the Obama administration due to its public opposition to torture . This objection may be overcome if President Obama will declare the asteroid to be an enemy combatant and place it on the Drones kill list . President Obama may then order the NSA to change Skaro ' s trajectory causing it to fall on Guantanamo so that he might kill two birds with one stone , said Dr Drown .
