Since the Department of Agriculture has no jurisdiction over farmers who choose to go out in the buff , they were perplexed as to what to do about Hans . A spokesman said , " Well , we suspect the farmer has E . Coli growing in his colon , but we can ' t pasteurize him . It would par boil his skin . " We also noticed that he is walking around on concrete , which is one of our Grade " A " Dairy requirements for the cows , but we haven ' t figured out how that applies here . " To the dismay of city officials , local residents joined in the protest by disrobing and sharing gallons of fresh , raw milk .
