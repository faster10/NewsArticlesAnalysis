Acadia University was founded in 1838 , when the town of Wolfville became so boring that a seminary spontaneously appeared . Initially , there were 21 students at the University , the entire population of people in Nova Scotia at the time . Since then , enrollment has decreased by some 40 . I cannot stress enough to you how small this university is . It is like a little tiny bird of a university that sits in the palm of your hand and chirps naively and you could crush it any time that you chose to crush it , but you choose not to because it is so , so sweet . It is a sweet little university and we love it very much .
