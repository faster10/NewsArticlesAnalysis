" That wouldn ' t surprise me in the least , " said onetime executive producer of the smash hit television series The Golden Girls , James Feinberg , over the telephone from his home in Beverly Hills . " What most people don ' t know , " he confided . " Is that the original name of the series was The Golden Girls Two Old Guys . Unfortunately , the two old guys never made it through the pilot episode . I went to their trailer halfway through shooting and nothing , just two small piles of clothing and a bloody lobster bib from Cherbourg By The Sea , which is a restaurant , by the way , just down the street from Bea Arthur ' s home .
