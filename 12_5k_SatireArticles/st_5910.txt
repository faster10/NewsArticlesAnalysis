" I was dozing off there in the eighth inning right after I think some guy hit a home run to bring us within one run of tying , " said Colorado resident Russ Gamble , who was in attendance at Coors Field at the time of the announcement . " But then my buddy nudged me , told me the news about A Rod , and I was like , ' Man , this is incredible ! ' I was literally on the edge of my seat thinking about where he might end up in 2008 . Cubs ? Tigers ? Red Sox ? Oh man , if I were the Red Sox , A Rod would be my number one priority . "
