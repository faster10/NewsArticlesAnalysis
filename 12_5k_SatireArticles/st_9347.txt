" We decided it was time to re evaluate our religious views and the question everyone had was , " What has God done for us lately ? " ' was how Preibus began his explanation for the de Christianization event . " We saturate our platform with his name liberally , I mean generously , and he treats us like we ' re Jezebel or Jane Fonda for crissakes . We start jihads against non Christians in his name , we make austerity cuts to the 47 heathen deadbeats and provide tax cuts for those who put more in the collection plate than everyone else combined . Hell , we even put his name all over our most sacred possession money and what do we get for our investment in Christianity ? We get our moneychangers booted out of the temple , that ' s what . "
