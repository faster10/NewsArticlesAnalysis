" There were a whole bunch of boats out there on the water , with all these rich guys running around on them , moving ropes from here to there and switching sails around to , you know , try to make the boats go faster , I guess , " said 61 year old Newport area dockworker Bill Duigan , who witnessed the rich guy ' s stunning 11th hour victory from more than three miles away while hosing bird shit off a pier . " I couldn ' t see what was going on too well , on account of they were way out there on the water , but from where I stood , I guess I ' d have to say it looked like that one with the blue sails was movin ' at a pretty good clip . I heard he was the one that won . "
