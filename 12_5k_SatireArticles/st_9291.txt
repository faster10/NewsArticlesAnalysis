The sheriff is talking about the " Wadesville fire " that started on the feeder road of Interstate 64 on June 28 . It has already burned 150 , 000 acres and it is not yet contained . The fire , located about 3 hours from St . Louis , was apparently started when the torchbearer laid down the torch to relieve himself on the side of the road . Thinking that the torch would be safe , and considering that the stop would only take a few minutes , the man carrying the torch inadvertently set it on a bag of trash .
