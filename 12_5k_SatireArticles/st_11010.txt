Unbeknown to Lambourne , just four rows behind him sat Farooq bin Farooqin . He was a young and impressionable man from Pakistan who had been coerced into a suicide mission . Although he didn ' t really understand what was happening he didn ' t want to disappoint all the much older and hairier men who had told him to travel to London and meet a man who would fit him with some exploding shoes . With the shoes on he managed to clear customs and take his seat on the plane where his plan was to detonate his fatal footwear . It was only when the plane took off that Farooq realised that after wearing sandals all his life that he had never learned how to tie or untie the stringy bits on top of infidel shoes . This foul up has been labelled Al Qaeda ' s most embarrassing mission failure to date , and the group have vowed to toughen up their membership criteria so that in future all prospective members must prove that they can tie their own shoe laces .
