" These numbers paint a sobering picture for the American working poor , " said Institute co chair Mary Ellen Armbrister , one of the chief coordinators of the eight year , 7 million research initiative . " The data we ' ve collected clearly illustrates that our nation ' s economic system is biased against the low income sector of society . This bias is evident in a wide range of economic indices from overall earnings to yearly net gains to discretionary household spending and holds true regardless of a person ' s age , racial background , gender , or geographic location . Across the board , this disparity appears to be universal . "
