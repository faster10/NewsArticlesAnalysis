CC Well Dave , We can ' t just leave those folks out in the cold . Fortunatly for them it doesn ' t get very cold here ( ha ha ) . Initially we will set up refugee camps in the Florida Everglades . What the gators don ' t get we will move to college dormitories , now empty mind you , till they can find other accomodations out of state I think 14 days ought to do it . Anybody left after that , we ' re working with the feds to put them in the military and send them to Iraq .
