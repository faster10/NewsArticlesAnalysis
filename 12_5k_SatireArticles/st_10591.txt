A conservative wacko far right reporter from Fox News dared to question the ACLU and PFAW ' s lawsuit on the issue by asking the spokespersons that they did realize that their surnames are religious based . Soon after the question was asked , reporters from CBS , NBC , CNN , and the NY Times physically attacked the Fox News reporter and bound his mouth with duct tape because of his unruly and disrespectful attacks on the spokespersons . US Baptist then asked the bound Fox News reporter to repeat his question but the gagged Bush patsy reporter only replied with a muffled " mmmgggmmmm " .
