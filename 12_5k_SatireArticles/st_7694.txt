" Train is one of those groups that has catchy songs that rhyme . I bought their first album and didn ' t realize that I was pretty much listening to nonsensical gibberish used specifically for arrangement of rhyming . Record Town would not take my refund , but not because the CD sucked , because they were out of business , " said music lover David Michaels . " I wonder if FYE would take it back . Or maybe Spencer ' s Gifts . That store will take anything . Who is Spencer and why would he sell Slinky ' s in the same store they sell calendars of cats ? " Michaels wondered aloud in almost a tangential parallel to the topic of incohesive behavior .
