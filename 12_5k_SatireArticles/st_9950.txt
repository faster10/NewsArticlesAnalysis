In early Primate communities , large trees were used to store banana supplies for various tribes of primates . These trees , now an outdated security method to keep intruders from stealing the supplies , have been replaced by large skyscraper like towers . These towers mimic the appearance of a fully functional building , such as an office or hotel , but their true purpose is to store the Bananas that Drumpfy has already attained and continues to attempt to attain . His towers are also meant to be a deterrent of jokes or comments about the unfortunate length of his primate fingers , which were unable to be surgically corrected to appear human . Their sausage like appearance , is said to disappear in the 5 oclock shadows of his towers , making his egotistical and insecure self image a little less unbearable
