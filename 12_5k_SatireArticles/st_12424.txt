Au contraire Mr Pfeiffer , UN Ambassador Susan Rice owes the American public an apology for : 1 ) being dumber than a box of rocks 2 ) not being able to ascertain that the talking points she was given to parrot on the Sunday talk shows were a charade to hide the incompetent Obama administration ' s failed Islamic terrorism policy 3 ) being a pawn of President Obama , possibly attached at the hip or other body part 4 ) being arrogant to anyone daring to question being fed a load of bullshit by the Obama administration and 5 ) fraudulently collecting a taxpayer provided salary .
