" I ' m glad the government ' s making sure daycare places be all supervised , " said Chicago mother of three Tanya Odomes , 20 . " There ' s a lot of stuff that can happen when you don ' t keep an eye on kids . Like this one time last summer , I went out for a few minutes to cash a check , and my baby Anthony fell out the window . I wouldn ' t want no shit like that going on at no daycare . "
