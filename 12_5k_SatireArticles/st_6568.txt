" Crawford Square is a pedestrian oriented neighborhood with a large public recreation center , a three mile jogging trail , and residents with a wide range of incomes , " Rothstein said . " Green space is great . It felt wonderful to turn four defunct foundries into a park lined community with access to downtown . Would ' ve been even better to turn it into a community lined with , say , 85 percent of the existing parkland and a few more goddamned dedicated turn lanes . "
