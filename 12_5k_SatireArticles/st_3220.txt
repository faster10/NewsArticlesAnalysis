But may I remind you that this man voluntarily enlisted to serve in Vietnam ? He didn ' t have to go to war , but he chose to go , to serve his country . He got shot at and wounded . He could have died . Some nights he was scared , but he just kept on going , kept fighting with his fellow soldiers , fighting for America . "
