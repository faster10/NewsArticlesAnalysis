" A lot of what I intend to yell will be pre planned it will be things I ' ve shouted at cars before , " said Fife , chewing on his right forearm . " But I definitely want to leave open some room for improvisation . For instance , if a red car passes by , I might be inclined to shout at the driver , ' Where ' d you get the fancy red car ? ' But then , if another red car drives by a bit later , I might become angry and demand that the driver stop and give me kidney beans . "
