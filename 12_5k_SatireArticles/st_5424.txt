First introduced into the cultural landscape in the early 1960s , the hippie , or homo habilis VWbus , was initially applauded by freakologists , who believed they would be beneficial in curbing the growth of the then ubiquitous Establishment Type . When the crisis passed in the early 1970s , the hippie population was reduced to a fraction of its former size , creating room in the American freakosystem for numerous other subcultures , including punks , new wavers and goths . Social developments of recent years , however , have caused the hippies ' numbers to balloon once more .
