The jotters went missing from the staff car that Patton had provided for Winston during the preparations for D Day and only four were subsequently recovered . However one of the jotters was sold on ebay ( US ) one month ago to a representative of the Churchill Trust who acted surreptitiously on the Trust ' s behalf . The remaining jotter is still at large and it is this jotter that is said to contain Winston ' s funniest and best known quips such as ' My Arse ! ' , ' D ' oh ! ' , ' I ' m free ! ' ,
