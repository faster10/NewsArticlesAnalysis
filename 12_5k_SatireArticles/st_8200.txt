Quantum dots : Michael Bowers , still working in a basement in the physics building after 7 years of study and more than 358 , 000 of his dad ' s money paid out in tuition , became enamored with " microdots " after watching an episode of James Bond . Using pilfered university equipment , and student labor paid only in beer , he managed to create a crystal resembling a tiny orange , which said " UT Sucks " written across it using 34 tiny atoms . When billions of them thrown at the visiting UT basketball team , nobody knew . But when the lights went down for the national anthem , and Bower pointed a laser pointer at the gym floor , the seemingly randomly scattered microdots spelled out a gigantic " UT Sucks " across the entire gymnasium floor .
