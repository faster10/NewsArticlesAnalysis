Asked to explain the thinking behind this feature , Director , Sir Rob R Customers explained " Since there is every probability that a lot of the travellers using the new runway terminal aren ' t ever going to make it to their destination , and for whatever reason , this seems to be thing that most gets passengers in a rioutous mood , then we thought , wouldn ' t it be nice to cheer them up with some sunny weather and a feeling of what it ' s like to be on holiday and with the virtual airport screen we can give that to them ! I ' m sure when they go home , it will be a long remembered and cherished memory of how much BAA cares about and goes that extra virtual mile for its customers . And that ' s what we find with our customers , no matter how much they moan and groan , or involve the Ombudsman they come back to our airports year after year and I ' ll bet my Knighthood they ' ll be back next year ( or to one of the other BAA UK airports , since we own all them all anyway ) .
