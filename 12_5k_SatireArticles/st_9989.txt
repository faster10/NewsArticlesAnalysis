One very classy lady appearing in her 60 ' s was crouched and trembling next to her Maserati , appearing very traumatized . She gained her composure enough to grant a brief statement . " My name is Savanna King . Connecticut is my home . I ' m not that religious but was running low on Xanax and thought a Sunday service might calm me down till I could phone my doctor tomorrow . What I witnessed was . . . I just can ' t describe . At first the noise startled me when they kicked the door open . Then those horrible outfits ! Stuff like what I gave to Good Will in the early ' 90 ' s . Sequins , shoulder pads , wide belts , big flamboyant hair . The perfume ! ! ! Christ almighty it was like some one had a shootout in the cosmetic section at Macy ' s ! Then when I didn ' t think it could get any worse they all shit in the floor ! ! ! THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME ! ! ! Several months ago I was at a banquet in Los Angeles when a filthy Guatemalan gave birth and crapped in the floor right in the middle of dinner ! ! ! " The paramedics reached Ms . King and took her away in an ambulance at that point .
