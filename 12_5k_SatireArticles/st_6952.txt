Porter , who served from 1942 45 in the Air Force ' s legendary 53rd Tiger Squadron in the European theater , registered 11 kills during the war , but missed out on the fall of Berlin and the subsequent German surrender . Porter ' s plane was shot down over Frankfurt , and , though he was able to kill numerous German soldiers in hand to hand combat , he was injured during his flight to Allied lines . For more than 50 years , Porter has longed for the opportunity to kill another German , putting an exclamation point on what he considers to be the greatest war in U . S . history .
