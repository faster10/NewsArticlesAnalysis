But for David , even the movie analogy doesn ' t hold water . " Look , Butler was the preseason 10 team in the country , and Duke was preseason 8 . And Butler was practically playing a home game , so it ' s a pretty even matchup , and I could even see the case for Butler to be favored . Also , the favored home team in Hoosiers is from Indianapolis and the underdog is from a small town . Have you ever been to Durham ? That place is a craphole , sort of like Hickory . Just sayin ' .
