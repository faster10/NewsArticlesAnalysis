Oddly , the Democrats have been praying relentlessly for just such a revelation to be bestowed upon someone , ANYONE , within the Republican Party , yet for four years this prayer went unanswered . They especially started praying harder once they realized their hopes for the mid term elections were going to tank . This sudden descendance of the Holy Spirit upon the leader of the Republican Party came interestingly at the time when the rightist had gained control over both the House and the Senate . Strangely this revelation never came to them at any time sooner during the six years that they spent voting against almost every policy and effort Obama made or effort that he put forth to get things rolling in the country , literally kneecapping him at every turn . The Republicans claim this odd timing of the blessing is just another sign that they are God ' s Chosen Party .
