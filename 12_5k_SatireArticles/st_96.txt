" As long as there ' s someone like Earl out there with a gun and ammunition , we are unable to carry out our attack on America , " said Maxwell Caufield , a covert military leader in charge of the operation to turn the country into an authoritarian , one party state wherein the basic rights of citizens are stripped away in order to create total government control . " Try as we did to spread our distorted gun control propaganda claiming that it would protect innocent people across the country from needless deaths the man just wouldn ' t bite . There is simply nothing we can do about Earl and his gun , damn him . "
