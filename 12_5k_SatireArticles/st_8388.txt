Andre Agassi : " I ' m afraid they ' re true , Hans . It was all an illusion . I need to just say it , and get it out there , and free my sole of this burden . I already feel better . There , I said it ! That lump in my shorts it wasn ' t mine , it was all a big , long , rubbery lie ! Ahhhhhhh ! It ' s like a giant weight has been lifted off of my groin . "
