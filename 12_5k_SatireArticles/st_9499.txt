The coexistence that exists between life forms as old as 13 . 2 billion years is yet undefined because it is not known , but logic states that it does exist because they are alive and they are 13 . 2 billion years advanced and they are aware of each other and they coexist in peace like an organized group of horses and antelope that graze in the same field of grass . The relationship that exist between us and life forms 13 . 2 billion years ahead of us does not resemble the relationship between a dolphin and a human because humans and dolphins evolved at the same time since we share the same star . The star of an advanced life form existed 13 . 2 billion years before our sun was created and the life form continued it ' s evolution in a non physical dimension after it ' s sun died out .
