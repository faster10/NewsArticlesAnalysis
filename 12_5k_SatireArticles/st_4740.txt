" Under ideal circumstances , I would ask you all to remain silent and not say anything at all , " Obama said while struggling to talk over the millions of voices quickly growing louder and louder . " But since I know this is not , at the moment , a realistic possibility , I would ask that you please not drive anyone to run into a public area and kill innocent people . Also , anything you can do to dissuade people from purchasing or otherwise procuring a gun , knife , explosive , or other deadly weapon would be greatly appreciated . I think we can all agree that is a fair and sensible thing to do , right ? "
