" The driver was out of it for awhile " , reported the police officer first on the scene , " and Ms . Stewart , who had parked and ran back , had her hand under his head . Then he came to , found he wasn ' t injured but agreed to be taken to the hospital to be check out . I recognized Ms . Stewart from the Twilight movie and her photos on the net . I wonder what the guy will think when he hears who took care of him ? "
