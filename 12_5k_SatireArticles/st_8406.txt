The " 40 mile man " will turn 40 before the start of the 2016 season . He already holds the NFL record for career yards ( currently at 71 , 871 ) and career passing touchdowns ( currently at 539 ) . He also has a coveted Super Bowl ring he earned in 2007 with the Indianapolis Colts . The only remaining record he still might want to secure is most career completions . He is currently 180 behind Brett Favre and so far has proven a source of profitable betting as he has had a great career .
