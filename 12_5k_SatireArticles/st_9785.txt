Astonished Uniontown terminal personnel acted as quickly as possible to bring control to the situation . A replacement bus , a tow , 2 automotive psychologists and several grief counselors were sent to the scene . Many , if not all , of the passengers were visibly shaken . " I don ' t know what to think . . . I have to take some time . I need to talk to my husband and family . They ' re my support at times like this . I don ' t know if I can even make them understand , but I have to try . Right now , I ' m leaking like a sieve and I can ' t stop " , said Mrs Aldena Wolfe . Jerrold Morst echoed her response : " You know , you ride a bus day after day , year after year without ever considering that something like this is possible . You think you know a bus . And now . . . I mean , just listen to it " .
