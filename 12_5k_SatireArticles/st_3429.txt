Sensenbrenner ' s son Chris , 16 , said he bets he could eat an entire war pie all by himself . " Obviously , no one in the family wants to see young American soldiers die in battle , but we sure do love Mom ' s war pie , " Chris said . " I walked in the house after basketball practice , and I could smell it in the oven . Mmm , mmm , it ' s too bad we don ' t go to war more often ! "
