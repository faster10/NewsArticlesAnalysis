Irving Chief Of Police was unavailable for comment , but the assistant chief Jim Kenton made the statement : " This should have never happened , I ' ve been on the force for twelve years now and I ' ve never seen this kind of injustice before . Mr Dunbar ' s serious lack of judgment caused this precinct a lawsuit that could result in millions . " Charles Dunbar is currently undergoing an investigation conducted by the Internal Affairs Department , and will likely be suspended from the force . " We are doing everything we can to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again . This false arrest is an embarrassment to the Irving PD . "
