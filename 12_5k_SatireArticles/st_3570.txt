" I heard that Lou Gehrig had a problem with ALS being named after him , " Quinn said . " He was always telling his wife , ' You know , I was a completely disease free pro ballplayer for more than a decade before I started to show even the slightest symptoms . ' Boy , can I relate . Except , at least Lou Gehrig ' s Disease is also referred to as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis . They ' ve never even given my condition a scientific name . It ' s just Quinn ' s Disease , and that ' s it . "
