Even more surprisingly , it was Jonas who spilled the beans on his ex girlfriend ' s new romance . In an interview with E ! news , he said of his break up from Williams : " It ' s one of those things where you grow up a lot faster . You are put in a situation where you ' re going to deal with things right in your face . But I think Serena and I are both very professional and mature . And now it ' s just easy . We ' re just friends . And she ' s got Zac , and Zac is a pretty good guy . "
