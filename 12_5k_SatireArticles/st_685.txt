" This is a historic moment for humankind to confirm the existence of another planet that is almost indistinguishable from our own , " said mission leader Allen Brugel , who explained that after releasing the Orbital Mirror from a Delta IV heavy rocket at an operational altitude of 104 , 000 miles , the team received almost instantaneous images of an Earth like planet approximately 208 , 000 miles away . " It is remarkable to find another celestial body where water is not only present but also covers two thirds of the planet ' s entire surface . What may be even more surprising is that it was discovered in a part of space that was previously thought to be completely empty . "
