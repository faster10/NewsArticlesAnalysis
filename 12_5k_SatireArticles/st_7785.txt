What happened , you see , was that Kristen in an attempt to rouse Robert from his Living Fossil Fantasies booked he and her on a day trip to the Albanian capital Tirana . Unfortunately , when they were there , they were mistaken for Ordinary British People by the Albanians , and suffered much in the way of being accosted , with cries of " Hey , Master Grimsdale , my trouser are short ! " , " Do not laugh , I sing like a fool ! " and " Fall Over Mr Pitkin ! "
