Incredibly , yet another man on board the flight had hatched a plot to bring down the plane . Mohammed Dun Roamin had been so enraged by the BBC sitcom Citizen Khan and it ' s ridiculous and stereotyped depiction of his faith that he hatched his evil plan . As a cleaner in the Physics department at Luton College for Sexually Awkward Young Men he had ample opportunity to create a remote controlled explosive device . On the morning of the flight he inserted the device into his rectum and boarded the plane . An hour in to the flight he took the detonator from his jacket pocket , only to discover to his horror that he had picked up the fob key to his Toyota Prius instead . In a mad panic he undid his trousers and began trying to get his fingers inside his back passage to detonate the bomb manually . Under normal circumstances this would have aroused some suspicion , but the passenger in the next seat happened to be Dorothy Bridgewater who later reported " my husband worked in the middle East for many years and it was fairly common to see these men picking at themselves in this fashion , even at the meal table . I thought it best to ignore the grubby little man " .
