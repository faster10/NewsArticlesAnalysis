BMW working in conjunction with Oxford have developed a new range of heated handlebar grips . The new ultra soft rubber has exhibited excellent thermal insulation and anti vibration properties , when moulded to form a revolutionary pull on pull off handlebar sheath . The new ultra soft rubber can be used to contain the residual heat of the grips for long periods , thereby slowing down the transfer of the heat to the grip surface by 87 . The sheath surface is also ribbed on the inside and outside to give more grip and to transfer more sensation to the rider than comes from the more traditional materials used currently . Oxford is also producing a version of their passively heated outer glove using the new ultra soft rubber . The outer glove surface is also ribbed on the inside and outside to transfer as much of the natural feel as possible to the rider ' s normal gloves whilst reducing vibration .
