" Where did you get all this false information ? " asked Tricky Dicky as he stood outside the bars of my cell . " It is the truth It is all over the Internet along with the proof of corruption in our government . " I replied . Tricky Dicky stomping up and down on the floor and said , " It is all lies , " " What proof do you have that it is not true ? I countered . " Because Lyin George says so . " he said with a finallity that chilled my blood . With that he again left me alone . By now it was getting dark and I could hear the coyotes barking and the far off howl of a wolf . I figured Ticklish Terry was still being enthralled with Hootin ' Hana ' s tales of vampires and witches or he was hynotizing her with his pastoral scenes when the door opened and Ticlish was roughly pushed into the cell next to mine . " What are you doing here ? " I asked . Terry gave me a sad look and I could tell he was not tickled being there , " I ' m charged with being a terrorist because I ' m your friend . " There was little I could say and soon the hangin judge returned . Without a trial and no fanfare she condemned us , by Lyin ' George ' s excutive order , to die on the gallows as terrorists .
