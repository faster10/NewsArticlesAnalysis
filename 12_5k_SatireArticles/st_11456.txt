Even the Bushes , longtime supporters of all things Christ , are rushing to join the anti Jesus crowd . " Jesus is almost as bad as a Communist Islamic fundamentalist North Korean Cuban Soviet homosexual , " said former President George HHHWW Bush . " He ' s against capitalism , free speech , and family and as far as I ' m concerned , that means he ' s against America . And if you ' re against America , you ' re against God even if you happen to be God . We also have good reason to believe he ' s been developing WMDs . "
