" American manufacturers are ambitious and they ' re naturally going to want to add flashing lights and microchips to the ball , " said industrial economist Rick Mattoon of Northwestern University . " But we think it would be a good idea if they fully mastered the fundamental aspects of the ball before moving on . For example , manufacturers should ask themselves , ' Is our product round ? Does it roll ? ' If not , then they should just keep at it we know they ' ll get the hang of it eventually . "
