However , just as Rosie and Jim hit the dizzy heights of UK children ' s TV , Ragdoll Productions commissioned The Teletubbies . " C nts " splurts Jim . " I tell you something , the public need shooting for watching that s it . Here we go , let ' s get four puppets who look and talk like spastics and get them to eat custard and toast every f cking day . Well done , now all yer kids can eat toast and custard and talk like Stephen Hawking with a c ck in his mouth " . " I came back from doing a speech at the University of Oxford about the influence of TV on the juvenile mind and found Rosie taking it up the wrong un from Dipsy . I remember pinning him against the wall before beating the living crap out of him when we went down the next lock . Rosie said she did it as revenge for me getting a suck off La La at the Ragdoll Christmas Party in 1999 but that ' s what La La did . Fanny to rent for Warwickshire the slut . They used to have orgies with Noo Noo the vacuum cleaner you know . His nozzles seen every Teletubby orifice there is to see ! "
