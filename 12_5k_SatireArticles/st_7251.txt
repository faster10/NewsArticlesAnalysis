" Fans of the film ' s original release in 1977 have long claimed that they recall Han pulling out his blaster and heartlessly shooting a virtually defenseless Greedo under the table , " he continues . " As the person who ' s most intimately involved with the motion picture in fact , I directed it I can tell you it never happened that way . When the film was released in last decade or so , I tried to fix what had so long been incorrectly perceived by the fans . I inserted a digitally reprocessed shot that I believed more accurately reflected the events , and , in this sequence , I believe I overcompensated because I only created an all new controversy on the internet . Fans were now claiming that I had ' bastardized ' the original sequence because they believe I depicted Greedo shooting first . Because of the endless banter weighing down certain corners of cyberspace , I felt it necessary to hold this press conference today to definitively explain whether Han shot first , whether Greedo shot first , or what did happen .
