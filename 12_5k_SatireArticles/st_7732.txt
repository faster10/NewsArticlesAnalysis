" It was a great movie . The problem with a lot of these dissenters is that they are living in the past . These days , people don ' t want to see welding and angle grinding in movies . A few sparks and a cobbled together tank don ' t cut it any more . People want three D and spectacular CGI . At the end of the day , nobody is interested in tight scripts and good acting . This is the age of console gaming and txtng . These old farts need to get their heads around that . "
