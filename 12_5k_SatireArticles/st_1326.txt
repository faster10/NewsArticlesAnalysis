" Instead of having a 27 inch television in every single room of the house , perhaps Mr Fenton could opt for 32 inch televisions , but only in the living room , kitchen , master bedroom and breakfast nook , " Walker said . " It ' s a quality of life issue . Bigger TVs with more channels , not more TVs . More heads on the VCR , not more VCRs . Only taping very special episodes of McMillan And Wife , not every episode . Simplify . "
