" It was a safe choice , but it was what I had to do to rebuild B3 , " he said . " Sure , Razzles are fine for a flex spot like F8 or G2 , but not B3 . B3 is an anchor row . It ' s at eye level and it needs a solid product in there to draw your attention to the C ' s , which is where you put the big guns like your Twix or your M Ms . I didn ' t even consider Snickers , though . You can put Snickers anywhere and people will find it . "
