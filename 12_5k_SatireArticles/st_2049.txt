" At the Spring Concert last year , I had to hold hands with Jeremy Halcote , so I pulled my sleeve all the way down , so I wouldn ' t have to touch him , " said classmate Christine Halley , commiserating with Tyler . " He didn ' t even sing . He just stood there breathing really heavy . And he had a cold sore on his lip that started bleeding , because he kept licking it . And he was wearing tennis shoes , even though Mrs Cook said ' no tennis shoes . ' "
