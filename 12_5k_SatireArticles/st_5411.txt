" I have so many great memories from when my own parents brought me and my brothers here , and we all rode Space Mountain and watched the Country Bear Jamboree together but my wife , Danielle , and I just didn ' t have enough money to bring our own daughters , " said resort guest and father of two Paul Gomez , 36 , speaking to reporters while holding a Mickey Mouse shaped ice cream bar and wearing the park ' s iconic mouse ears hat . " I wanted more than anything to give our kids the same amazing experience I had , but with all our bills and mortgage payments , we could only cover a pair of airline tickets and park passes . I know my girls would have loved going on Splash Mountain , getting off the ride , and then rushing to get back in line with us today . "
