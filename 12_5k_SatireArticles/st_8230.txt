" UEFA has decided to make incorrect referee decisions mandatory , effective from the knock out stages of the UEFA Champions League and the Last 16 of Europa League . This ruling will be applicable to only these 2 tournaments this season . However , starting the 2012 13 season , all leagues and all competitions overseen by UEFA will be required to introduce mandatory referee decisions which are incorrect . This decision was taken up as part of our efforts to drive the organization along the ' totally not ridiculous ' vision of our legendary President Michel Platini . "
