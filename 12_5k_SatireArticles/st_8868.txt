The thing that ' s so sad about this report is that Bush only received 14 months incarceration for being a veritable Hannibal Lecter of monkeys and other species . The DNA of chimpanzees isn ' t all that different than ours , you know . It ' s almost identical , in fact . And knowing how a deranged lunatic feels about having a collection of dead monkey heads staring at him as he smokes his pipe in his living room , sharpening knives and wheezing , he ' ll most likely enjoy all the horrors of prison life . And when he gets out , he might graduate to trophy hunting for more advanced primates , like homo sapient apes . But then again , he might be totally reformed in prison . When he gets out , he may buy a good set of binoculars and take up bird watching .
