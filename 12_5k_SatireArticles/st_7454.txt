Highest on the list was there had to be a love story inherent in the plot a device Disney has used ad nauseum since it began making feature length films in the forties ( with the exception of Old Yeller , Tron , a couple of its cartoons and that Living Desert film from the ' 60 ' s . ) For this latest installment in the series Abrams chose to have the black storm trooper be infatuated with a Bantha ( the huge beasts of burden from the very first film with the curly cue horns ) , which definitely will add a new twist to things ( perhaps twisted would be more like it . ) .
