" Water quality is an extremely important issue that should concern everyone , " CCW director Brian Zuboff said . " We want to teach people that environmental ' stewardship ' is not an abstract concept practiced in the wild by a field biologist . It ' s something everyone can participate in , whether by properly disposing of their household waste or urging their elected representatives to enforce and strengthen existing land use and zoning regulations to prevent unchecked urban sprawl and wasteful forms of development that harm wildlife habitats and degrade our water .
