The undisclosed FBI source said : " It was such a pleasure having our little chat with Mrs Clinton . " " Especially since it was scheduled on a Saturday . " " Normally , we ' d just be wasting time at home with our own love ones and families . " He further added : " We didn ' t spend much time talking about that stupid email thing , rather all of us FBI agents were enthralled by her anecdotes about her husband ' s golf game , tender stories about her grandkids , and all those yoga classes she had been taking . " " She did admit she had gained a few extra pounds in the caboose and was glad she had found yoga pants with lots of extra elastic and reinforced seams . "
