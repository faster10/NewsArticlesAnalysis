In closing , let me leave you with one last thought . Bad things happen when good people decide to do nothing , when families believe that there is nothing wrong with expecting someone else ' s children to carry out the difficult burden of ensuring that " the evil ones " will not be allowed to destroy the world ' s right to remain free and safe . So I am asking for each of you to make the decision to be on the leading edge , the cutting edge , of doing the will of God . I am asking that you do what must be done in order to bring freedom and democracy to the rest of the world . I am asking that you do what you know you must do in order that the world will someday declare that the United States of America truly was , is , and shall remain the land of the free and the home of the brave .
