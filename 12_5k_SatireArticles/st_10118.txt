NASA itself has offered to accept some of the blame . A public information officer told reporters they realise suspicions about the former Lisa Marie Caputo should have been raised during last July ' s Space Shuttle mission , when Captain Nowak requested she be awakened by ground control with the theme from The Godfather . Among Captain Novak ' s assignments on that mission was delivery of 28 , 000 lbs . of equipment and supplies to the International Space Station using what NASA described as an Italian built " moving van " ( http : www . astronautix . com astros nowak . htm ) . Unexplainably , between the Shuttle and the Station , approximately 7 , 000 lbs . of that cargo apparently " fell off " the van . That cargo has now shown up in a Sugarland , Texas self storage warehouse .
