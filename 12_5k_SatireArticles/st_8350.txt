Sources close to Goodell say that he came up with the idea of robotic football players at a garage sale when he saw a dusty old Rock ' em , Sock ' em Robot game , in which two robots engaged in combat inside a boxing ring , while the kids operating the robots stayed outside . At the same garage sale , Goodell saw an electronic NFC football game set with a vibrating table . " And the rest is history , " noted John York , a co owner of the San Francisco 49ers , which would be among the first to transition from human to robotic players . ( The team would be known as the San Jose Light Sabers , York added . )
