Last night one of his fellow seamen told our reporter : " Lots of the guys onboard have them . I myself have a huge tattoo of Friedrich Nietzsche on my chest . The other sailors rib me and say that I have just bought into the whole concept of the ' bermensch ' but you get that kind of banter in the navy . A mate of mine had a tattoo of Kierkegaard done in Copenhagen . It ' s not everyone that has the father of Existentialism poking out from the top of his boxer shorts . I thought it looked fantastic and decided to get a nineteenth century philosopher done myself . It was only after that I realised Nietzsche was the brains behind Nazi Germany . "
