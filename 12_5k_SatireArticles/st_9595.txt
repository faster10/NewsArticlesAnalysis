According to independent statistics , since its inception in 1984 DARE has had incredible success keeping kids off drugs when those kids didn ' t have access to popular recreational drugs like marijuana , or whose grandparents were responsible with their prescription drugs . Said one drug free teen " none of the kids I know use marijuana , and the ones who I think might do it won ' t talk to me , so , I can ' t buy some . They just stuff me in my locker . So I haven ' t used marijuana one single time since I signed the DARE pledge ! Plus , grandma and poppy never leave their prescriptions just lying around . " Said another teen from the same high school , " yeah , I signed that DARE thing , so did all my buds . It was cool we didn ' t have to have algebra that day . After school we went to the park and got totally stoned . "
