When asked about the one successful raid , the detective teared up a little . " It was horrible . We saw jars everywhere in the guys ' home . Beta fish living in the worst of conditions . They were being fed steroids and creatine . They had tiny cramped spaces and were forced to sit next to each other and smash against the glass for endless hours trying to attack each other . Some swam in their own fecal matter and urine , and others had no where to move , surrouded with hundreds of tiny fry ( baby Betas ) . We seized at least a hundred Betas from his home . "
