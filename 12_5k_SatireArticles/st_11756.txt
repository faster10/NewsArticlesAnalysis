Sure I sent that photo of my dick to lots of you , but I took a great deal of time setting up that shot . I used my desk lamp to get the lighting right and I used my SLR camera with a special soft focus lens ( nothing soft about the photo though , right ? ! LOL ! ! ! ) . Then I had to upload to my computer and then sync it to my phone . So many steps ! Would a creep put that much care into a single photo ? I don ' t think so . So at least you can do is send a quick nip shot .
