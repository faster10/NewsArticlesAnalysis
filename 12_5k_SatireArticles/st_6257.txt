" We ' re proud to have Clay aboard here in Tampa Bay , " said Bucs owner Malcolm Glazer in a press conference held at the team ' s practice facility . " It was extremely difficult tracking him down , of course , as his family was not in contact with him , and the only thing we had to go on was that he was wandering the nation , working odd jobs , doing good deeds , and playing in pickup games . But now that he ' s here , we expect him to start immediately . "
