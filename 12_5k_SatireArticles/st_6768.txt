Gallup polls taken during the campaign show an evolving awareness among voters that Santorum is not lying about any of the horrifying things he says . For example , in August of last year , 96 percent of voters said they thought Santorum could not possibly be serious when he said gay marriage was " an issue just like 9 11 , " compared with only 9 percent today . And in that same time span , the number of voters who believe Santorum was not at all kidding when he said the president had a " deep seated antipathy toward American values and traditions " has increased more than tenfold .
