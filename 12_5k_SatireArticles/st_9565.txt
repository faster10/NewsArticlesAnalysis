The porn industry scoffs at these allegations . " We ' re just fulfilling a demand that ' s out there , " says one industry insider . " We didn ' t create the demand . People can ' t get enough sex , so they turn to pornography . I don ' t think you can get too much of a good thing . It ' s not possible . I could eat sugar till I drop . My stomach would explode and I ' d be lying on the ground clawing for more chocolate bars and stuffing my face with them , because I can ' t get enough .
