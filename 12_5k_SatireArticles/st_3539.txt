" The truth is , in Cory ' s miserable dish washing world , a new mop head does count as a reason to be happy , however pitiful that may seem . In this shit bucket life , you take your moments of satisfaction where you find them , " the 61 year old said . " Do you think I like the fact that the best moment of my entire day usually comes when the factory ' s break room toilet flushes all the way down on the first try instead of taking two or three ? Pathetic as it is , that ' s the truth . After a 12 hour shift making screen doors , if I make it all the way through one rerun of Adam 12 without falling asleep in my chair , I get a tiny jolt of happiness . And I learned long ago not to be ashamed of that tiny jolt of happiness , because , let ' s face it , that ' s as good as it ' s going to get , and I may as well enjoy it . "
