" Now , take me for an example . Before I was married to Vanessa I used to date girls maybe one or twice a season when I built up enough nerve to ask one on a date that is . Most of the time I would take my date right here to the library . We would discuss all the philosophy books we found in the stacks . Afterwards we would go out for a Pepsi Cola , and then I would walk her home , shake her hand , and say ' Good night ' to her . A few girls felt a little shy about shaking hands on the first date and I never pressed the issue . When a girl says ' No ! ' it ' s best to listen and stop right there . "
