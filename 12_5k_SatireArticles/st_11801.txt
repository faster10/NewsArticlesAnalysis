It was a Friday at 5 : 30 PM , so speed wasn ' t much of an issue , and I think the horses really enjoyed the relaxed pace , " said Guinty in an interview at the friends ' Montreal hotel room . " Someone put on " Life is a Highway , " we cracked some warm beers , and just started talking about where we ' d been , and where we were going .
