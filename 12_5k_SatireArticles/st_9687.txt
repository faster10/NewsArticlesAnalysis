" Our goal in admissions is to attract the best students to the college , " says William R . Fitzsimmons , Dean of Admissions at Harvard . " Our students must have excellent grades and test scores , rigorous classes , strong character , and leadership experience but we are simply drowning in qualified candidates . So , in addition to those prior qualities , Harvard wants applicants who can soar through the air , leaping through flaming hoops like graceful seals , or perhaps majestic killer whales . "
