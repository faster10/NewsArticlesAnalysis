" When I get there , I gotta warm up first , " Drake said . " I ' ve got a whole routine . First , I play the nickel slots , like that American Bandstand one . Once I got my mojo working , I move up to the quarter slots , or maybe even the dollar slots if I feel like I ' m on fire . Never stay on the nickel slots , though . Those are for grannies . You ' re wasting your time on those . "
