A spokesman for the LCROSS lunar mission denied the impact was actually a " landing " per se , insisting that it was merely a " controlled impact " in search of water . " WATER ! ? " screamed Vox in a live feed on Larry King . " You idiots are surrounded by freaking water ! How about we fire a black hole at Earth to see if you have craters ? " Vox even questioned the scientific merit of the mission itself , calling it self aggrandizing over achievement without practicality . " The humanoid that invented fire didn ' t just want to use it as bling , " he mused .
