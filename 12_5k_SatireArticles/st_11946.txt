Me and my ex boyfriend David also had very little in common : He didn ' t want to have kids I wanted to have seven . He didn ' t enjoy making conversation with strangers I talk to everyone I meet . He prefers the winter season I only like sunny , warm weather . He votes conservative I vote liberal . He ' s in love with Miranda I ' m in love with him . And that ' s just off the top of my head ! The trick is to just ignore the differences or , to find someone new .
