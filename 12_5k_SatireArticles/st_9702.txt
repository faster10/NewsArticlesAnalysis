But the learned Mufti , Lush Al Rimbaugh , put the issue in a clearer light when he explained his Fatwa at a gathering of GOP pols and mullahs : " Look , I know Pope Francis thinks he knows something about religion , but he obviously doesn ' t . God and religion are tools meant to stir up fear , hate , anger and paranoia within people so they ' re easier to manipulate . And I ' ll tell you what , this hopeful demeanor this new Pope has seems very similar to that of President Obama ' s 2008 presidential campaign . And we all know President Obama is the anti Christ . The last thing Americans needs is hope . Pope Francis might need to take a few classes in American Christianity before he offers any more insight because the stuff he ' s talking about , the Koch brothers just won ' t like . " Al Rimbaugh then added : " Somebody needs to shut this guy up ! "
