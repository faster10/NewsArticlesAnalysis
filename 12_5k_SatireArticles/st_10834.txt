" It is a classic maneuver , the I Was AGAINST the Subversive Plot BEFORE I Was FOR the Subversive Plot , where an initial meaningless political act allows the members of a conspiracy to claim that they actually disagree with one another . When conspiring to fix the outcome of a vote , you want the outcome to seem legitimate , perhaps with a close margin of victory , but large enough to be undisputed . Generally speaking , a 0 97 vote while seeking absolute power reveals a grotesque lack of sophistication . Then again , the Washington DC politicians may believe the American voters are the most STUPID animals on the planet therefore , sophistication would seem irrelevant . "
