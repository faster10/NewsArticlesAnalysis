" You should see him when he gets going . You ' d think ping pong was some kind of ESPN2 extreme sport , " Hersh said . " He ' s all like , ' Time for a serious ass kicking , Jason . Think you can take it when I bring the hammer down on you ? Think you can handle the humiliation of another devastating defeat at the hands of the master ? ' Then , whenever he scores a point , he shouts , ' Boo Ya ! ' and does this gloating victory dance , strutting back and forth and waving his arms in the air . I mean , it ' s ping pong , for Christ ' s sake . "
