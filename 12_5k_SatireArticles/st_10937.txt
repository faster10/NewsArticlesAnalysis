Catholic traditionalists have condemned the latest Vatican initiative as a desperate attempt to appeal to modern popular culture . Father Francis O ' Goblin ( 97 ) of The Children of Suffering and Guilt made the following statement . " Catholic Lite ? All we had in my day was candles ! If you were lucky you had an oil lamp ! No one in my village had a proper light and now His Holiness wants to give every Tom , Dick and Harry who has any doubts in his belief a light ! The Catholic Church is about feeling guilt , self pity and suffering , preferably in the dark . Too many people nowadays go around having a good time and enjoying themselves and now they can do it with the light on ! "
