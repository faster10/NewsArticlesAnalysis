When asked what he thought actually happened to cause the final fallout between the Father and Son , Jesus explained : " I ' m just too old school for my own good , I guess . I ' m a sandals and robe kind of guy in a designer fashion world . Heck , I went to Greenwich Village the other day and people were handing me money and food like I was homeless . It was irritating . One guy handed me a bagel and I kinda snapped . I was like , ' Hey , I ' m the Son of the Almighty , alright ? I ' ll make this one bagel into enough to feed this whole city , man ! ' But I had to cool down , you know , because of that ' love thy neighbor ' policy we had at the business for so many years . "
