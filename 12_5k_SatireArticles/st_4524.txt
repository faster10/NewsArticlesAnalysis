While the infant dedicated dumpsters will cost an estimated 220 million to install and maintain , Giuliani is confident they will more than make up for their cost in the long run . " Babies deposited in the new dumpsters will be collected , tagged and redistributed in a far more organized manner than those left in traditional multi use dumpsters or garbage cans , " Giuliani said . " This will greatly reduce the strain on our city ' s already sorely overtaxed human services and child welfare departments , saving millions over the long haul . "
