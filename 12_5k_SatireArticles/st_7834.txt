Juan Antonio de Jesus y Maria Guadalupe Torres Sanchez de Alba of Univision agreed . " At our network , we try to show the importance of our heritage . We want our children to know where they came from and to understand why they are important . We want them to respect and honor their culture and to embrace it into their daily lives . Our young , and all viewers , must come to understand why they will be the leaders of tomorrow . It is their destiny to run this country in the future and they must embrace that . A new network that promotes Anglos and tries to show and tell everyone that they are better than us is just wrong and prejudiced . This is a racist agenda . "
