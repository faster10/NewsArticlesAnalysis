" Our matadors wish to ensure the safety of the Spanish people and tourists alike , " Zapatero said . " These bulls may gracefully dodge the swords and spears of justice , but our men will not back down . They shall engage the bulls with intricate goading , ritualized mockery , and the hypnotic waving of streamers . They will not stop posing in their sequined suits until every bull is removed from the arena , and every torero is free from fear of tossing , trampling , and goring . "
