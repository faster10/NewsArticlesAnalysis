So can you imagine how great I feel that for once in my life something has actually gone right ! I ' ve won the lottery . I ' m not sure at the moment how much I ' ve won because apparently there are a couple more winners and we are sharing the total amount between us . I just remember how I felt watching my numbers coming out . . . 1 . . 2 . . 3 . . 4 . . 5 . . 6 . . and thinking that they were mine ! I ' m a winner . What are the chances ? I ' m so happy for once my luck has changed . '
