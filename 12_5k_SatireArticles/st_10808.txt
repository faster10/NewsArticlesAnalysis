" Look , I really hope that we actually killed bin Laden I really do , " Trump said in a phone interview on Fox Friends . " I hope that the President produces bin Laden ' s death certificate so that we know he was actually killed . But I am really concerned , I mean , there are really serious questions here . Osama is just one of the 600 members in the bin Laden family how do we know that , you know , we got the right bin Laden ? And to date , we have , you know , no troops that have verified that they shot bin Laden , we have no photographic evidence to confirm it , we don ' t even have a body allegedly because it was buried at sea . I mean if President Obama has such great intelligence on this guy , enough to , you know , trace him to a compound in Afghanistan or Iraq or Pakistan or wherever it is , why can ' t he produce bin Laden ' s death certificate to show that this was the guy actually killed ?
