" The bog floors are awash with water most of it steaming piss . Children run splashing through this stinking lake without shoes , meaning that their socks if they wear any are sodden with urine , and will reek all day . The cubicles are no better . Turds , days old , bob about in the small amount of water that there is in the bowls , have decomposed , and have dissipated a messy brown cloud from which the porcelain will never recover . On emerging from the stalls , children are faced with taps that either don ' t work , or wildly spurt out water . Soap is nowhere to be found . "
