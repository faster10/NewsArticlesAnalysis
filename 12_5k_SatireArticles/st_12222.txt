Meanwhile , somewhere just outside Houston a local resident , identified only as " Art from Oakhurst " said , " If it ' s so safe , why do I have to wear a Kevlar vest when I play golf three times a week ! I hear gunfire every night , and just last week we found two heads in the sand trap on 4 ! I think the administration is blowing smoke up our arse , and you can quote me on that ! It ' s so dangerous here we held my class reunion in St . Augustine last weekend because everyone was afraid to come to Texas . Better to be dodging Harley ' s than Bullets , is what my classmates told me ! "
