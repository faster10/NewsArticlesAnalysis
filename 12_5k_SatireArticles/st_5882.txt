Kaplan tearfully rued living " episode to episode " rather than focusing on the big series picture . " My characters made lots of friends like the kindly old man at the senior center who turned out to be Santa Claus but they never kept in touch with them for more than one show , " he said . " And why did I make Bill so self absorbed and childish ? Sometimes I wish I could reach into that TV and shake the living daylights out of him . That ' s a beautiful , beautiful family he has , but all he ever thinks about is beer and sports . "
