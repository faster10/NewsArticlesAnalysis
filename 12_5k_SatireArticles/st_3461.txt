" Weed had a friend with him who didn ' t say a whole lot , but he certainly encouraged him by laughing at everything he said , " Finnis said . " The smart alecky one would say , ' Man , this is even cooler than the Thermos Hall Of Fame over in Portage , ' or ' Remember : Only the all time greatest RVs are inducted into the RV Hall Of Fame , ' and his pal would egg him on by laughing . Then , he would do something else stupid , like act like his foot was stuck under the tire of one of the RVs and scream . A real comedian , this guy . "
