Fellow citizens of la Belle Province , let me begin with an appeal to my record as premier . You elected me based on my platform of not being Jean Charest . And haven ' t I done exactly that ? Haven ' t I , since my election , been a person with an entirely different name and set of DNA than Jean Charest ? So , considering the extent to which I have kept my campaign promises , I know you will forgive the liiiiiiiittle hiccup that I ' ve come across with my secularism charter .
