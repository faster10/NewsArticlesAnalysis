" I got home last night and had the urge to listen to Jane ' s Addiction ' s Nothing ' s Shocking , " Pinter said . " I haven ' t listened to that album in , like , 10 years , but then I remembered how I used to listen to it whenever I came home drunk and alone in college . It really transported me back to that time when the whole world seemed fresh and new and I couldn ' t get a hand job to save my life . "
