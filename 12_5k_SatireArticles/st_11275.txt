Mar . 5 : We were having another strategy session when my cellphone rang . It was Mother . I asked her how she had gotten my number . She said she gotten it off the Internet . Right then and there I put a curse on the unholy Internet that would send thousands of unsolicited emails to all the profane users in the west . I asked her what she wanted and to make it brief because I was in a meeting . She said it was briefs that she called about . She wanted to make sure I had clean underwear in case I was hit by a smart bomb while crossing the desert . She asked about akemd and Hassim , if they had any . I held the phone up to Hassim and heard a scream . When I put the phone back to my ear the line was dead . Hassim is becoming more and more valuable to the cause .
