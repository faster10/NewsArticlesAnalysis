" Everyone tells me I have to ' accept it ' and ' move on , ' " said Wallace , locked in his bathroom in a fetal position with the lights off . " But how can I be expected to carry on as normal when at this very moment , less than 30 blocks from here , some stranger is putting his hands all over the only woman I ' ve ever found true love with , driving her into a state of transcendent sexual bliss with his relentless pounding and pounding and thrusting and squirting and pounding , making her shiver and quake with sweet release ? Huh ? How am I supposed to just ' forget it ' with all of that pounding going on , right now , at this very moment ? "
