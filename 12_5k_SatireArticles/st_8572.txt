Michigan Talented Typists from across the globe will gather in Detroit ' s " Typodrome " this weekend for the 98th annual World Typing Championships ' . 50 contestants will " fype " ( pun combining words " fight " and " type " okay you do better ) it out for the coveted " Golden Typewriter " which , in case you ' re bad at figuring things out , is the trophy awarded to the eventual winner . Organisers were glad to announce they have secured the services of typing superstar and former World Champion , Mavis Beacon to set the games in motion . She will press the gigantic Return Key on the enormous novelty keyboard that has been erected just in front of the main stand of the Typodrome to instigate the games . ( 84 people died in its construction funnily enough the same number as there are keys on a keyboard , though most family members of the victims failed to see the funny side . I say " most family members " a couple were seen chuckling at the collective funeral although those chuckles have been directed towards the priest who had an hilarious speech impediment in which he always says Jebus instead of Jesus ) .
