This is a fair summary of what Archie Pelago told me . I am unable to report his report verbatim , as he is , as I discovered during our conversation , an exponent of the Ancient Thracian art of Sbzgmegma , a form of dialogue in which one participant reports and the other , the reportee , has to precis the report , being careful not to use more than 12 . 67 of the vocabulary used by the reporter . Apparently , my summary here is good enough to earn me the accolade of being a dimmerax , or so Archie assured me !
