Dr Sandy Sanderson , professor of sociology at the University of Alberta , herself an ex stripper , has been studying ads under the adult section for the past six years . " We ' ve found that 60 percent of the ads put out by females seeking sex for money state that the women are young students unable to pay their rent and bills . " And indeed , these ads work . When men were polled , an astounding 80 percent said that if they had to choose between a professional prostitute and an amateur student just looking for financial help , they would choose the student , no matter how unpretty or sexually inept she might be . " I just want somebody young and kind of desperate . That ' s a turn on , " says David Utah of Frank , Mississippi .
