There was a suggestion from the now hostile press that you can ' t legislate for someone like Ben Wallace . " We ' ll see about that " , he roared . " Have you ever heard of a little book called The Bible ? Yeah ? Well in that book there ' s the story of Samson and Delilah and I can ' t remember exactly how it goes but I know they cut his hair off and then after that he ' s not as good as he was . You see what I ' m getting at ? I say The Fro Must Go ' , I ' ve had t shirts made and everything . We could have him shave it all off live at the Draft ! I ' ve only just thought of that . Quick , someone write that down . "
