Dr Glans has studied brain waves in klitting women . He finds a characteristic electro encephalogram pattern displayed by almost all of his research subjects . He describes it as a peak of intense wave activity several minutes after klitting begins , similar to the pattern of some types of epileptic seizures . This peak is followed by a steady alpha state comparable to that generally achieved through meditation . Some women experience several of these peaks before settling into a plateau . Dr Glans is currently seeking research grants to continue to explore the reasons for this phenomenon .
