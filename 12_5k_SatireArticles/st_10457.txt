After order was restored and all factory workers were corralled into freezers normally used to keep vitamins fresh , company officials summoned the Rev . Guido Sarducci , pastor of San Jos de los Trabajadores , the local Catholic church . After falling to his knees in front of the vitamin , he rose , making a sign of the cross , and reached under his cassock for his cell phone . Sarducci quickly snapped a photo of the vitamin and sent it , high priority , to the Vatican ' s " Validate the Vision " hot line . Within seconds he received a response saying further investigation was needed , but that he must keep the morsel from melting in the hands of believers .
