Those white boxes with a nondescript yet menacing appearance have turned the U . S . into a tinderbox . According to statistics obtained by SAPP , the white Great Value boxes account for more fires than electric cars , lightning , cooking , smoking , and playing with matches COMBINED . The only source of fire that exceeds white Great Value boxes is smoking while pan frying fried chicken while simultaneously baking a turkey basted in bacon grease over an open fire pit next to a leaking propane cylinder turned upside down while watching an episode of Gilligan ' s Island ( SWPFFC BTBBG OFP LPCUD GI ) .
