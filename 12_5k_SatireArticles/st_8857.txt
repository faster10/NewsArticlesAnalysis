" I can totally understand why some people are being very reluctant to help us , I wouldn ' t help someone who was at risk of being killed and having their family wiped out if it affected me in absolutely no way whatsoever . In fact , the entire situation has just reminded me that a lion was killed in Zimbabwe , did you hear about that ? It was atrocious . That event , in turn , reminded me of a time when the roof of my house caved in after a bombing . I thought to myself : " blimey , if only I had chosen to be born in Kent . "
