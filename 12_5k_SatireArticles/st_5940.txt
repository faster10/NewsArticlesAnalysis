" No one ' s going to tell me that Tippy isn ' t beautiful the way he is , " Mathers said . " If he wants to lose weight , that ' s fine . But he doesn ' t have to do it for me , or the vet , or even my husband , who doesn ' t want Tippy allowed in the living room because of his intestinal troubles . I think Tippy ' s perfect , even if he can ' t fit through his doggy door anymore . "
