Many of the POW ' s were listed as missing in action so to identify themselves to American authorities , they each had written their Social Security numbers on small pieces of paper and slipped them to Fonda as she greeted them . To their horror , however , after Fonda finished meeting them , she turned to the North Vietnamese commanding officer and handed him the POW ' s pieces of paper . In the beatings that followed , three American POW ' s died and Col . Carrigan nearly died .
