Dr Dung Ho and other scientists with funny sounding names are now leading a campaign to get Republicans to pick a less intelligent and more selfish animal to represent them . " I think a large garbage eating rat , like the ones found in New York City , or a pit viper would make a more suitable choice . I hope Congress will consider passing a motion to switch animals , for the health and well being of elephants everywhere . Personally , I don ' t think that any animal should be subjected to this type of brutality , but clearly , Americans feel the need to have some sort of animalized symbol in politics to represent their feelings .
