Said Pavlik : " An interesting thing to note about the covered bridge at Swilley ' s Creek is that it was built by a construction company that was once owned by the third cousin once removed of the great grandfather of you guessed it Eleanor Sloane . I should also mention that at the time the bridge was built , 1892 , the cousin , Ekvind Solberg , had sold his company to Alfred F . Griebel , who would later become county supervisor . Upon its sale , Ekvind joined his brother Anders to manage his grain elevator in nearby Plovis , which did a modestly successful business before eventually shutting down in the early 1960s . "
