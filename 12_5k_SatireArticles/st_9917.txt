IM Gloss , spokesman for the State Department ' s office of Guant namo Bay closure chief of staff , confirmed the episode but would not say which country had agreed to take in Mr Bwazir or whether the department was negotiating with it to take someone else instead . Unconfirmed rumors cite an offer to include Sarah Palin in the transfer discussion . " I cannot discuss the details of Mr Bwazir ' s decision other than to say that , yes , he declined to accept an offer for resettlement in a third country , " he said . Earlier in the Obama administration , five Uighur detainees Muslims from China rejected offers to be resettled in Flint Michigan or Paterson New Jersey , spending several more years at Guant namo before they were finally transferred to Eniwetok and Chernobyl .
