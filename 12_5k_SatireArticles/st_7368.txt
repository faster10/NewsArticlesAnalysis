We thought we ' d get a little religious perspective on Lorde ' s music , so we talked to a minister from the First Mississippi Second Church of the Holy Assemblies of God of Christ , Reverend Brother Janus P . Wainwright III , who had this message for us : " Any attempt to understand these lyrics is fruit less ! It ' s worse that fruitless , it ' s use less ! There is only one Lord , and his name is Gee Zuss ! Let me hear it again ! Geee Zuss ! These kids with the tattoos and the wild hair , they think they ' re worshippin ' the Lord , well they ' re worshipping the wrong Lorde ! Goin ' straight to Hell is what they ' re doin ' ! Can I get an Amen ? A men ! Incidentally , the book of Exodus has some interesting things to say on the subject of fruit , as does the Song of Solomon . "
