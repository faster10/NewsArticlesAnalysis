" I didn ' t have the time to connect . It ' s not easy speaking to dead people . They tend to get distracted by the light in the tunnel , and I think the audience were unfair and judgemental . When I asked one person if his dead granny used to have a massive handbag full of ould shite , he just started jeering . I mean who could possibly know that ? And when I said about the old lady being reunited with the cat on the other side , they all started heckling me . People are just too cynical these days . "
