" I ' m devastated , " one said . " I was just about to tell the world that we were having fish and chips for tea . But I ' ve been denied that . I ' ll try to tell the world at half past seven that I intend to watch Coronation Street , but to be honest , there doesn ' t seem much point if I can ' t tweet it . I ' m losing the will to live . I can tell you . I bet this never happens to Stephen Fry when he gets stuck in a lift , or Simon Pegg when there aren ' t any coathangers in his Budapest hotel room wardrobe . Seems to me it ' s one law for celebs , and a different one for the rest of us . Or something . "
