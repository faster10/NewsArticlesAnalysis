Esc believes , " Alt Del has natural ability in spades but in this company he may suffer . He will be prone to such errors as " slipping the shift " ( typing slang for failing to hit " shift " key while pressing another key ) as there is no shift key on the piece of crap that he uses . He also has trouble typing the letter " R " , as that key is broken on his piece of shit typewriter . He ' ll find it difficult nay impossible to adapt "
