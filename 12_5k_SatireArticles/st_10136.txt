The most recent high profile case was Attorney General Alberto Gonzales . Alberto Gonzales testified to Congress just weeks ago that he was not involved in the firing of eight US attorneys to find out just afternoon that he had discussed that very topic for over an hour with his deputy attorney general and had instructed her to go ahead and " axe the unpatriotic bastards " . In a statement to CNN , Gonzales told the nation that he was shocked , even saddened , by the news that he had forgotten the events of the meeting . " So help me God , I don ' t even remember having a meeting any meeting I couldn ' t have had a meeting I delegated all of my responsibilities to staffers immediately upon taking the oath of office . I have been here in Palm Beach ever since . Damn ! , I almost forgot my tee time . Excuse me , I have to be going ! "
