In their meetings , AA members discuss plans to get their message out . They are creating leaflets with such factual tidbits as " inhalation anthrax begins with the same symptoms as the common cold , yet it is the most deadly form of the disease " and " untreated intestinal anthrax is deadly 25 ' to 60 ' of the time . " AA is also petitioning the school to get an announcement before lunch . Their main goal is to let kids know they shouldn ' t be pressured to do anything they don ' t want to do .
