The French Estates General , which has not met at all since it was officially disbanded by King Louis XVI in 1789 , assembled today in Paris to condemn the NHL ' s decision . A groundswell of bitterness towards America is expected , many observers of Franco American affairs fear , yet it is not felt believed that the antipathy will become so intense that any food items will need to be renamed .

" The governments of Chile , Saudi Arabia , Denmark , and Nepal have all declared a period of official State Mourning . Various Eastern European nations , including Romania , Latvia , Estonia , and Belarus , have placed their militaries at the highest state of alert . The United Nations Security Council issued a strong Resolution denouncing the NHL ' s decision .
