" You know , I think my Dad would have wanted it this way , " said Dale Earnhardt Jr . , son of the racing legend . " After all , he never wanted anything for himself that he didn ' t want for his family . And while I may be his son , in a strange way , my dad thought of everyone on the NASCAR circuit as his family . I know that somewhere , my Dad is cracking that creepy smile of his , thinking of us all going flat out towards his memorial on Sunday . "
