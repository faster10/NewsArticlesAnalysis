Tony Blair , Great Britian ' s Prime Minister , was available for comment when the Canadian media asked Canada ' s allies if they would provide help . " We ' re mobilizing our forces now , " he said . " Canada has been a valued member of the commonwealth for hundreds of years . They are a close knit ally and friend . We won ' t let them down , and we won ' t stand for what the American government is doing in North America . "
