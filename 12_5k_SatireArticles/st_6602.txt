" There is no right in American democracy more elementary and fundamental than the right to elect political representatives , " Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the court ' s majority opinion . " Simply put , we cannot uphold the U . S . Constitution while continuing to deny and abridge money from full suffrage within all levels of government . All manner of U . S . dollars from the biggest bank account to the smallest bills deserve the opportunity to be heard within American democracy , as well as the full freedom to promote their political interests . "
