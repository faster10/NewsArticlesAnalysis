Don ' t ask me to " come blow your horn " too ! Don ' t ask me how it feels to touch the world ' s biggest organ ! " Don ' t ask me if anyone ever blows my organ pipes ! Don ' t ask me if I ' ve got brass balls to go with my brass organ pipes ! Don ' t tell me that you wonder how I zip up my pants with an organ that big ! Don ' t ask me how often I shine my pipes ! Don ' t ask me if I also play the skin flute ! Don ' t ask me if Brigham Young ever polished my organ pipes ! Don ' t ask me if there is a key to playing with my pipes !
