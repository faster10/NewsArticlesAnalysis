" As a scholar of conspiracy theories , I ' ve learned to be wary about their actual definitiveness and credibility , " said Edwin C . Tapfel , director of the Foreign Policy Institute at Columbia University . " For example , last year ' s most hotly anticipated manifesto , The Extensive Role Of The Freemasons , Microsoft , Pol Pot , The World Bank , George Bush , And The Lake Champlain Monster In The Ruby Ridge Massacre , turned out to be a huge disappointment : inconclusive , sloppily researched and utterly uncompelling . Hopefully , Mr Hausch possesses the clarity of mind and scope of vision to pull off his ambitious undertaking . "
