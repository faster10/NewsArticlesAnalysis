Listen , I ' ve been practicing for over 36 years . I know my stuff . Brushing your teeth alone , no matter how thoroughly you think you do it , isn ' t enough . A brush simply can ' t get through all the nooks and crannies in your mouth , but dental floss does a damn good job . And anyway , had you flossed regularly , like I tell you during every visit , it ' s possible I could have avoided drilling through your tooth with the same handpiece I used on 7000 patients before you . But , what ' s done is done , and now you ' re probably left with some version of hepatitis , all because you didn ' t floss !
