According to Rwigema , responsibility for caring for the plant will be divided between the Hutus and Tutsis , with members of the two tribes watering it on alternating days . The plant does not need direct sunlight , Rwigema noted , but requires a thorough " soak , " ideally in a bathtub , every 10 days . Due to an 18 month drought that has destroyed all of the nation ' s crops , water for the plant will be imported from Tanzania . Water supplies will also periodically be confiscated from Rwanda ' s " least thirsty " citizens .
