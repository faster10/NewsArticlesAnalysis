Jose Mourinho said in his press conference this morning ' Shevchenko has not been good for us , but I am sad to see him leave . He made good coffee . But 30 million pounds was too much . For that kind of money we could have launched a cloning program , developed a whole squad of Ruud Gullitt ' s and Gianfranco Zola ' s , given them breasts and included self replicating hair product in their DNA via genetic engineering . Through this sale of Shevchenko to Leeds United for 110 pounds , we are getting a much better return on our investment . "
