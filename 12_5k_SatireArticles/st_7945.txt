Kell ' s new line of computers has a power supply whose outputs can be varied between 3 and 12 volts via software . The current limiting function of the power supply can also be adjusted or disabled through software . This may sound like it gives the user a lot of flexibility , but it does not take into account the fact that many components require a very specific voltage to work properly . For example , a hard drive that requires 12 volts may not work at all at 11 volts , and a processor that uses 5 volts can be " bricked " by 6 volts . It appears that it is not in the best interest of the user to be tampering with the voltages . So why would they allow this at all ?
