GERMANY " Diplomat of Destruction " Uh Uh No Way , the off its rocker 21st century splinter group of once hip and trendy Deutschland 70 ' s 80 ' s era ragtag gang of nutjobs , the Red Army Faction and Baader Meinhof Group ( currently under the skimpy bra and panties hooker heel control of uber extremo , former Wagnerian mezzo soprano soloist , Ulrike Mansdorf ) has , as promised , taken its less than enlightened denial of the holocaust stance public in a most becoming way . What with this choice bit of well tailored , style conscious , multi megaton workmanship , that apparently utilizes all of the stray belts gathered over a two month period at the Berlin Tegel Airport security check points as its scoch more room payload . All of which was as a result of a quick change of plans of sorts , brought on , no doubt , once Ms . Mansdorf and her team of loopy experts , determined that the bomb ' s initial design ( as made up of several tons of stray shoes ) was either severely limited ( due to there being only Foot Locker open in Heidelberg the day of construction ) or ( more likely ) filled with too much ironic like poetic justice , on account of the fact that any additional footwear would most likely have had to have been supplied by numerous area Holocaust Museums and or any Zionist Research Centers with a higher than usual degree of closet space .
