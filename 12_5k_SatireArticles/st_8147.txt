Last year , a decision was made not to put tobacco sales under the control of the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) . " What people don ' t understand " says Patricia Kizazz of the FDA Public Relations Office " is that if the FDA were to control tobacco , we would have to admit it was a drug , such as heroin , crack cocaine or marijuana , and there is simply too big of a tax base from tobacco sales for this to be allowed " .
