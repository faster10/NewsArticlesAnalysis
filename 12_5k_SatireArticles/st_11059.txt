" Well , me Latin is not dat good but bejaysus there was a lot of hoorin ' demons in dat oul fella and I have to say that most of dem spoke with an American accent . They wanted a lot of money for unfair eviction , so to speak and even threatened us , in perfect Oxford accents , with legal action . They weren ' t happy with my suggestion that they take over a herd of Irish Sinn Fein politicians , . . . complaining of probable overcrowding . I told dem in Latin that they had a point . We eventually managed to bribe dem off with a few signed photos of der leader Barack Obama . But Ratzinger is okay kept asking for young nuns to give him a massage and books to burn and stuff like dat . . . but , he is back to his old self fit enough , I ' d say , hand on me heart , to go goose steppin ' around the Colosseum wearin ' an apron and wavin ' like the Queen of England to mad people on Lambretta scooters . So far as we know , der is just him in der now , in de body . Nuthin ' der , praise de Lord , dat a few Camparis and a visit to his favourite Masonic Lodge can ' t cure . We suggested he go to Lourdes but he doesn ' t believe in dat sheepleshit . He likes to be among his enlightened brothers because they always give him free spaghetti and , did I tell you that Sir Christopher Wren designed and personally supervised the building of dat lodge ? It means a helluva lot , . . . if you will forgive me . "
