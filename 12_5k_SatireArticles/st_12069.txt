Police issued an advisory to be on the look out for items that look delicious , but are un attended like a box of donuts , a stray bag of potato chips , or even an unattended burger on a plate .

In New Orleans , the famous ' Fat Tuesday ' has been canceled until further notice as merchants across the country are taking steps to protect their property and employees .
