But don ' t panic please . Our physicists are quickly working on ways to counteract these attempts to confound our space exploration . Currently , we are developing new ways of viewing the universe and are finding hundreds of potential quasar mirages . These hundreds of potentialities are then meticulously looked over by scientists and subsequently classified as either a mirage or just two interstellar objects closely fitting the description of a cosmic mirage . Out of these hundreds of potentials , only a handful are discovered to be Russian quasars , but thank the Lord that we are able to find at least those .
