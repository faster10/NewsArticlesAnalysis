" Jenn just needs some rest " , West claims , referring to Wilbank ' s return to Vegas , which will be her second Greyhound bus trip to Las Vegas in 2 weeks to meet up with her hirsute hound dog and get married in the 2 , 000 per night Royal Penthouse Suite at the Bellagio . " She may be confused about a lot of things " said West , " but marrying Scooby is a sure thing . I have never seen her this happy . Scooby is the bomb . I heard he ' s got four brothers . I ' d sure like to meet one of them in a dark alley . " They ' re like the Baldwin brothers ! all of them are so handsome . Did you see Billy in Backdraft ? "
