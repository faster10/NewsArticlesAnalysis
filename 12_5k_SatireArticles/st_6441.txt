Standell defended the change . " A sticking point for me was the word ' enjoying , ' " Standell said . " You don ' t really ' enjoy ' a slide out tray . I just thought ' enjoying ' was off . Then , once I cut that , it became apparent to me that you don ' t need any action words here at all : Just tell the reader what part of the toaster you ' re about to talk about , and leave it at that . This was clearly a case of ' less is more ' something that ' s never been Ron ' s strong suit . He has a real tendency to overwrite . "
