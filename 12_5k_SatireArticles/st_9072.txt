Eric Embalmer , from New Horizons Funeral Directors , was also scathing of the new charges . He said , " We were called to come and collect one of our most valued customers , who had sadly passed away again . There were no parking spaces so we parked on the yellow lines outside the mortuary . We were only gone for 5 minutes , but when we got back we found the hearse had been wheelclamped . It took 4 hours to get the clamp removed and we missed the poor bastard ' s funeral . You can ' t be too careful in this game , it ' s not often you get repeat business " .
