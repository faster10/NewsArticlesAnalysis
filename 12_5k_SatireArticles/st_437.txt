" I read an article in the paper about that new drug Ecstasy and its long term effects on the brain , " Dunbar said . " I wanted to talk to the kids about it , but then I forgot what the article said they call it . Is it ' E ' or ' X ' ? Or is it both ? And I can ' t remember if you use ' E ' as a noun or verb do you ' do E ' or do you ' get E ' d up ' ? I ' ll have to make sure to get that straight . "
