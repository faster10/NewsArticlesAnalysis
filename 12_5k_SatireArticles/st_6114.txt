An analysis of health records revealed that of the 2 . 5 million individuals who died in the United States last year , a full 50 percent reportedly saw a woman in white , a raven with a broken neck in the middle of a footpath , or other augury at some point in their lives . In addition , roughly a quarter of the deceased had reportedly dreamed about multiple moons , drowning in mud , or a thorny tree sprouting from their heart , yet took no preventative action upon waking .
