" When the child labour costs came in , " said Hovis , " we could no longer employ children to put the holes in crumpets . This severely increased the manufacturing costs . Additionally , children ' s more nimble fingers were far more suited to wielding the crumpet bradawl . We did employ small stature women , but the life expectancy of a master crumpet bradawler is only thirty five and some of these women were coming to us aged twenty . That ' s barely enough time to get them trained up to the required standard . "
