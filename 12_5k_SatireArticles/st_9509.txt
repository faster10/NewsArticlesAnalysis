The three dimensional book moves by a mechanism in another space integrated into our space but both spaces do not collide with each other . To get a visual sense of this other space a person would have to glue a black marble to a red marble then anywhere that the black marble rotates or moves the red marble performs the same movement . The red marble represents the particles or atoms in our world and we can not see or touch the black marble because it is not part of our space . The mechanism in the other space is able to make a bird fly and a car move in our space . The mechanism in the other space is some type of force created by an alien intelligence . The particles in our space were created in that other space and then pushed into our space . Our space was created by a type of expansion like someone blowing air into a balloon .
