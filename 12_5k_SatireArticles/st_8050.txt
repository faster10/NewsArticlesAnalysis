Suddenly the tetrahedron lit up , and this writer could spot twelve members of the Keshe Foundation , ready to take off into space . Those twelve , allegedly the smartest , most fearless and most peaceful members of humanity , were visibly excited and smiling brightly . Most incredibly , this spaceship , aside from the four glowing spheres , was invisible . Yet the passengers were contained inside the tetrahedron .

Acclaimed journalist Gordon Duff and renowned UFO investigator Kerry Cassidy also took part in the discussion , but thanks to them it led nowhere .
