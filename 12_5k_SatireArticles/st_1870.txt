Sources within the Burmese leader ' s inner circle said he first became aware of the " Man Of The Year " honor when Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini was selected in 1979 , when Than Shwe was still an army colonel . Those who knew Than Shwe at the time said he was driven by a desire to someday make Time ' s cover , and began preparations by sparking civil unrest and executing soldiers for minor offenses . Since he came to power in 1992 , Than Shwe has steadily intensified his tyranny as it became evident with each passing year that word of his crimes was not reaching the editorial board of Time .
