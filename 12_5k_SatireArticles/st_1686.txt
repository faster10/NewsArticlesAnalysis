" I was just walking along the sidewalk when I saw this chubby , winged guy wearing some sort of diaper , pointing a red tipped arrow in my direction , " said Steve Kremms , an insurance adjuster who was pierced by love ' s dart during Monday ' s incident . " I didn ' t really know what was happening . I barely had time to shout ' Down ! ' and wrestle this mousy librarian type to the ground before I started stammering and feeling light headed . Her name is Jackie and she writes poetry . . . We both come to this park a lot , but I ' d never noticed her before , even though she has these amazing eyes . "
