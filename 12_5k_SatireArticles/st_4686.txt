" When we talk about Buddy Holly , we ' re really talking about a star with a once in a lifetime brilliance who will never be replicated , " Obama said , noting that artists like Elvis Presley or even The Beatles could never fully heal the nation or restore the purity of American life that existed before Holly ' s death . " Let ' s face it : Buddy Holly changed America . In many ways , he defined and embodied America . And I ' m talking about much more than what songs like ' That ' ll Be The Day ' did for rock music . I ' m talking about his attitude , his presence I ' m talking about that feeling you get when you listen to wild , unbridled music and hold your girl close . "
