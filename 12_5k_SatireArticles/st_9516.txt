The Crazy Uncles Society has been a boon for ostracized cretins like Leo . " When I feel I ' m about to explode with pent up eccentricity , I head straight to my chapter of the Society and let it all out , " he says . " We crazy uncles support each other ' s madness . Our little reunions are very different from those preferred by normals , let me tell you . At the Society , no one bats an eye if you feel like ramming your head through a wall or not showering or shaving for a week or being an alienated loser , drifting through the concrete jungle with nothing to distract you from the private hell of your vision of life ' s absurdity . I can even have a philosophical conversation with a fellow crazy uncle without everyone thinking I ' m wasting my time on nonsense . "
