Rake gave me an ' iffy ' hen ' s egg I guess it wasn ' t cooked right through anyway it tasted FOWL . I just don ' t trust him anymore because every bloody plant , herb , egg , mushroom or whatever he gives me tastes FOWL . I would appear to eat them , and enjoy them but as soon as the cameras were turned away , I spit them out . I wouldn ' t recommend anyone to try what I do ! "
