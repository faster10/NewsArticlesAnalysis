Mr Chirac ' s message was one of farewell , not only of politics but that of the weapons selling chief in charge of foreign acquisitions . He looked better than he had for some time knowing that he would never have to confront an enemy ever again . He said of France , " I love it passionately . " He told the French people , " Not for one instant have you ceased to inhabit my heart and my mind , not even while we were retreating , not once , VIVA LA France ! "
