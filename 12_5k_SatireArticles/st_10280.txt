Carl Schindler of ASS ( Association of Sextoy Suppliers ) rejected the idea that it ' s customers should be monitored . " We have no more control over how customers use our products than Dell Computer has over how it ' s customers use it ' s products . A notebook computer could just as easily transmit a sexual disease if used improperly , returned to the vendor then resold . It ' s unfair to hold us to a higher standard than the rest of the on line retailers just because we have erected one of the few profitable on line shopping categories . "
