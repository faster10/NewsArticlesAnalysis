Shop owner , Ted Larson , explained , " I hung that old bear trap next to the urinal in the men ' s restroom . It was kind of a joke . Lord , that thing is at least a hundred years old and the hinges are rusted solid . " Larson said that he was convinced that the trap wouldn ' t close . " I sprayed it with WD 40 and stomped on the release , and it still wouldn ' t close ! " said Larson .
