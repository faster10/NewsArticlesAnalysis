A local branch manager for a large mortgage company also voiced support for the policy , " Everyone likes to make the people we kill out to be victims . Trust me , they ' re not . Every time we break into a house late at night we offer to let the family live if they can give us the entire amount owed on their mortgage to us in cash . Hell , if they ' d do that we ' d probably let them off easy with a few rapes and castrations of all the males . But , no . . . There has not been a single family who has chosen to work with us . They ' d rather die than pull two hundred G ' s out from under the bed . That really shows you just how serious they are about paying their bills . "
