Although Kell has declined to comment on the issue , we assume that it is a measure to allow many different models of computers to use the same power supply . Although the plugs will fit a standard ATX motherboard , the voltage on each pin may be different from the ATX standard depending on the computer it was programmed to work for . Kell ships un programmed power supplies to computer builders and repair shops , who will have an application on their computers to program the supplies , since Kell ' s new power supplies initially output 3 volts at all outputs , because a voltage lower than a component ' s rated voltage will not cause any harm it simply won ' t work .
