" Listen , the film industry is a business . It is not about art and culture . . . whatever they are . It is about money . To get that you obey the program . . . promoting gender confusion , fear , insecurity , fleecing the sheeple and furthering the cause of the New World Order by turning reality into fantasy , fantasy into reality , black into white and morality into comedy . That ' s what we do . The day is not far off when we Brits will run Hollywood , lock , stock and smoking barrel . Right ? And , in the furtherance of those aims we do whatever we want . Now , Miss Moneypenny will see you out . "
