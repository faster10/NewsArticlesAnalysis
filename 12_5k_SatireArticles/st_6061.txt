Despite their disapproval of his lifestyle , Dornheim ' s siblings cannot find fault with his behavior around the family ' s younger generation . Dornheim has always been careful never to discuss drugs with the children , and he keeps his basement grow room securely padlocked when they come to visit . Dornheim also always makes sure his " big people stuff " including his three foot glass bong , collection of Bettie Page girlie photo books , and supply of nitrous oxide " whippets " are kept stashed away in a secret compartment built into his vintage 1977 waterbed .
