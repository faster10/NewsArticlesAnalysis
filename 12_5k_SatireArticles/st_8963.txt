Lord Cram of the Organising Committee says it ' s not just about the cost . " The eyes of the world will be on that stadium in 2012 . It will have a sliding climate controlled roof , a fantastic quality track , and specially designed seating to ensure that no spectator is more than seven feet away from the action . And just wait until the shotput . That area of the field is made of flubber we ' re going to see if we can get the shotputs to bounce into the crowd " .
