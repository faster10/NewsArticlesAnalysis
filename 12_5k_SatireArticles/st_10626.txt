WASHINGTON ( May 24 ) Congress may vote as early as Thursday to repeal the military ' s " don ' t ask , don ' t tell " law on gays , but when asked questions by White House reporters , Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who has a proud chin , carved by the winds of adversity , and eyes the color of a storm tossed sea , resplendent in a mauve suit , teal tie , and a saucy little attitude , said , " I ' m not tell ling , neener , neener , neener , " and flounced off , giggling like a den of Girl Scouts .
