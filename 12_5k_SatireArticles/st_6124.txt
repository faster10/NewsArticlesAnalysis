" Last weekend , the whole family decided to act out The Master , so my husband and I made sure to remove all the inappropriate stuff from the script before we started , " said 38 year old Cincinnati area mother Janice Dewins , who played the roles of Lancaster Dodd ' s wife , Peggy , the salesgirl Martha , and several other supporting characters . " My 8 year old son was Freddie Quell , who gets hooked on a mix of alcohol and gasoline , but we just had him drink orange juice instead . It was nice to be able to stop the performance at any time to explain to him what was going on or to comfort him whenever anything he was acting out got too scary . "
