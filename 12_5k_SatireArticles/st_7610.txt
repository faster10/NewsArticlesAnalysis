Other possibilities we are considering for characters are Woody Allen as Wall E , the robot , Al Gore as Doc , Mrs Bush as Mary Poppins , and Ann Coulter as the evil witch from Sleeping Beauty ( the nice thing being she won ' t need makeup ) . Bernie Madeoff will be introduced playing a new dwarf called ' Sleazy ' and Rob Blagojevich ' s hair will play Aladdin ' s carpet . For a special feature we will be introducing Sarah Palin as Xena , the Princess Warrior .
