Those who know him emphasize that Burkholder ' s abnormal clothing isn ' t the 11 year old ' s only peculiarity . According to his teammates , Burkholder is dropped off at the YMCA games by a bearded man , who many believe is either his father or older brother , driving a rusty pickup truck . The barely glimpsed man does not attend the games , and the truck , which always contains various planks of wood covered by a blue tarp , is not seen again until the game ' s conclusion . In addition , when Burkholder is late for practices or games , the team ' s coach never bothers to ask why .
