We are unhappy that the media has been using the name of our band in association with a kiddie fiddler like Glitter . We have a brand new album of which we are very proud but this adverse publicity and resultant confusion has resulted in a drastic drop in sales . We would be very grateful if the Media would kindly refrain from using the name of our band in any articles and reports about Mr Glitter . We are depending on our new album for our pensions and are furious that Glitter has helped kill sales . It ' s now looking likely that Steve Howe will have to reform Yes and Geoff Downes will have to reform The Buggles to compensate for the losses . "
