During a recent ethics subcommittee meeting , House Majority Leader Tom DeLay sought a loyalty pledge to President Bush from all members . As part of this pledge , subcommittee members were asked to give their souls to Jesus and their asses to the Republican cause . When Democrats suggested the later was a bit too much , DeLay ordered them to be strip searched and marched naked through the Senate . When asked by Senate Majority Leader Dennis Hassert why he had resorted to such a demeaning tactic , DeLay replied , " Jesus told me to do it ! " At that Hassert acknowledged that Jesus , indeed , now had the " political capital " to determine marching the Democrats through the Senate naked was appropriate . Hassert did say he would be verifying this with the Reverend Jerry Falwall .
