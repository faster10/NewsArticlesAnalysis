Of course , there must be bad guys . That won ' t be hard in the Star Wars universe what with thousands of planets to chose from , some of them teeming with evil creatures just itching to get off their rock and go bumming through other galaxies sharing their mayhem . Rumor has it Disney is sneaking Maleficent in it as the first female Sith Lord and the big , bad wolf from Pinocchio just to prop up their old movies . Also Jar Jar Binks will be making a cameo as the first trans gender bad person in the series ( he ' s not only gone over to the dark side but over to the feminine side as well . ) .
