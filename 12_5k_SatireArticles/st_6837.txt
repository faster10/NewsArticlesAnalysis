" I remember a time when the National Thanksgiving Turkey would never even think of disrespecting the commander in chief , " a man identifying himself as " Larry from North Carolina " said . " Those mealy mouthed liberals who complain about Cousin Wattle ' s treatment should be happy he wasn ' t shot on sight . They claim he ' s all by himself feeling lonely in that pen of his . Well , I know my family would be happy to keep Cousin Wattle company this Thanksgiving . We ' d serve him on a silver platter ! "
