And how about my prissy wife ? She asked me if I could turn the heat on last night . NO WAY . I ' m not spending useless money on hydro if I don ' t need to . Let ' s compromise here . We can close the window to the bedroom , but then we have to turn the fan on . And if you were talking about sex , then my answer is also no . I could get overheated in this weather and have a heart attack . Go ahead and tell the neighbours how I act . If it ' s weird of me to sleep on the kitchen tile floor ( naked ) when I ' m this hot , well , then , why don ' t you just sue me Maria ? I ' m sweltering .
