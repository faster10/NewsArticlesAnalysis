Rosalyn Murcheson Biddle , a Scarsdale , NY , art collector , was also extended an offer to join . " The PlatinumPlus only express lanes on the highways are nice , and so are the unlimited drinks , " Biddle said . " But what I really like is the program ' s Gold Circle Premium Health Care package , which gets me access to the finest medical care anywhere . It ' s nice to know that if I ever get too wrapped up in a car phone conversation and hit another vehicle , emergency workers arriving on the scene will prioritize my injuries over those of any other people who may have been hurt .
