A bear really does shit in the woods : " Thousands of bears of different species were tagged and then followed through their daily lives . We learned that if a bear needs to deficate and is in the woods , he will releive himself there . No bear was seen purposefully leaving the woods for the purpose of having a bowel movement . As is did not affect American citizens in our continental states , we did not study Polar Bears . Zoo and circus bears were not considered for the study either as they may not be near any woods when a call of nature comes . Our citizens , however , should know that their government can now say with certainty that bears shit in the woods .
