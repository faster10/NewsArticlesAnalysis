Google and other companies involved in cloud storage have expressed concerns about the NSA placing them at a commercial disadvantage . ' The NSA does not charge for this backup service and it is very easy for consumers to use , ' said a spokeswoman for Google . ' There is no need for consumers to register to use the service , they are automatically enrolled , and , indeed , most don ' t even know about it . It could not be simpler for them . As a result , the NSA also saves money by not needing to provide any technical support to users . In addition , ' she concluded , ' the NSA system currently seems more secure than its competitors who are regularly the victims of successful hackings . '
