" That ' s preposterous , " said on high ranking member of the biker organizing committee . " We were having a party , and these people showed up and were very rude to us . They threw things at us , called us names , and tried to ruin the entire event . So , what did we do ? We invited them to the party ! What could be more friendly than that ? You know , just because we are all members of motorcycle clubs does not mean we do not care about inclusiveness . Personally , I think it shows a lack of character for them to be saying such nasty things about us after we bent over backwards to make them feel welcome . "
