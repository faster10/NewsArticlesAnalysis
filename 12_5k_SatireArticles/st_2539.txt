" It is neither my duty nor my inclination to make human beings feel better about who they are or what they do during their short time on earth , " He said . " What does forgiving a human being do for me ? How is it to my benefit ? It is not . I have held dominion over the cosmos quite successfully for quite some time and I have done so without need or want of a forgiving disposition , and so it is and so it shall always be . I am that I am . "
