" My dear friends , it is I , Barbaro , " the firmament spanning equine proclaimed in his trademark deep , wavering baritone . " I come to you on this , the first Barbaro Day , to remind you that despite what you may see on television and in department stores , this day is not about big parades , or fancy toys , or getting your picture taken next to a mall Barbaro . Nor is it about draping wreaths and garland over the neck of your loved ones , sipping mint juleps at office Barbaro Day parties , or even about winning horse races . "
