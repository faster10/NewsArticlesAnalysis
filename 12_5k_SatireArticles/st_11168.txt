Dr Gibbon responded to the opposition argument , saying " Their objections do not hold up to scrutiny . Many people do a six year apprenticeship in their trade , as we do , and many people have jobs that involve as much responsibility as ours . " He went on to explain his view . " At present , most GPs charge about 80 for a ten minute consultation . That works out to 480 an hour they earn . " He further pointed out , " We are no more highly trained than the motor mechanic who looks after my car , and he only charges 120 an hour . "
