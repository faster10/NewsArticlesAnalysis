George W . Bush , a very young Air National Guard fighter pilot back in 1933 , recalls his efforts to shoot King Kong : " My unit was called upon to shoot that big ape on top of the Empire State Building . It was a very dangerous assignment . Our fighter wing used machine guns against King Kong . I tried to aim very carefully because I did not want to hit Fay Wray ( she was quite a babe , you know . . . ) I feel like I should have been awarded at least a Silver Star for my heroism , but all those New York Democrats made damned sure that never happened ! Now , this John Kerry guy is claiming he shot Cong Gee whiz ! He don ' t even know how to spell ! I ' m the pilot that shot King Kong , and I want my Silver Star ! " ( sniff , sniff )
