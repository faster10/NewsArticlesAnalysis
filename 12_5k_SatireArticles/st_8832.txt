It might be feared that a dugong , who has few natural predators in the wild , might be ill suited to the cut and thrust of the hustings , but we understand that Mr Pickles ' constituency team has delivered an intensive training course to the newcomer . It is believed that this has made the dugong virtually unassailable in an argument . For example , when questioned as to the failure of the Coalition Government to meet its chief targets , it will relentlessly preface its answers with " because of the huge deficit we inherited from the previous government . . . " . Further , when asked where the Conservatives will find the money to fund the extra Health spending promised in their manifesto , the dugong will simply reply " Look at our record . We have a watertight economic plan . Steady growth will deliver results . We must not go back to the economic chaos of a Labour administration . "
