A couple of weeks ago , the Dalai Lama changed the face of Azeroth , the world in World of Warcraft . Armed with a walking stick , boots of the shining and rags of a commoner , the Dalai Lama ' s World of Warcraft character , a level 1 paladin , walked up to a band of computer controlled orcs . In an effort to show solidarity with the other race , the character immediately unequipped his stick and typed , " Hello , " into the World of Warcraft server , hoping the orcs would respond with their own respective " Hello " grunt . Little did the Dalai Lama realize these computer controlled orcs have no way of reciprocating and were pre programmed to attack any non orc race , even if that race believed in world peace .
