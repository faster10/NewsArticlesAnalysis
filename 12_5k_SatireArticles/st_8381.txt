Our man on the scene , Chip Fairway , tried his very hardest to get an interview with Mr Jordan , waiting patiently each morning for him to arrive for his round . But , as you can imagine , he ' s a tricky guy to catch up with . " There he goes again , " said Goldburn ( who hadn ' t left Chip ' s side in days . ) " Just driving his Mercedes right up to the first tee , radio blaring his goddamn disco tunes he ' s a menace ! Good riddance to ya ! "
