" No , it might not have otherwise occurred to me to build a grind rail running the length of Mount Logan ' s East Ridge , " Wyoming Department of Natural Resources director James Hester said . " Nor would I have recognized the scree moraines on the south face of the Absarokas as the perfect foundation for a system of interlocking skate bowls . And I ' m as surprised as anyone to see the waters of the Shoshone River running through a system of concrete half pipes . However , the Wyoming Division of Cultural Resources , in partnership with the United States Department of Natural Resources , made a commitment , and we honor our commitments . "
