The NHL Phoenix Coyotes are moving to Chihuahua , Mexico where they will play as The Chihuahua Chihuahuas . Timmy Torres the owner of the Chihuahua team told ESPN that they are really excited about having a hockey team in Mexico and that all of the 400 , 000 season tickets have already been sold . When Torres was asked if the fact that they would be playing the games on an outdoor ice rink would cause a problem , he replied in Spanish ' No ' ( No ) . When reminded that the Chihuahuan summers can see temperatures as high as 124 degrees Torres just said ' No ' ( No ) . And when he was asked , " What time is it ? " Torres replied ' No ' ( No ) . So it is fairly obvious that Torres does not quite yet have command of the English language like Salma Hayek and Paul Rodriguez do .
