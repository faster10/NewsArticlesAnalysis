1 ) Your sunshine , cheap package holidays in Spain , Italy , France , Greece , Portugal , etc . Will now mean journeys to hell before you reach the paradise beaches of your still European neighbours ! You will , from the 24th of June , join every other nation on the planet , apart from EU members , in nightmare queues at every single airport from the Algarve to Andalucia to Sicily to Corfu ! The only places you will be made welcome are the Turkish Riviera , a lovely cockroach all inclusive holiday with Russian comrades fighting for breakfast every morning . Egyptian bomb shelled Dead Sea resorts , Tunisia Terrorist Territory , or a Syrian Ancient temple tour with ISIL fighters giving you all a wonderful welcome hand or head ! I believe Ryanair and Easyjet offer cheap flights to the last destination offering free bullet proof vests and tin helmets instead of scratchcards and crap snacks !
