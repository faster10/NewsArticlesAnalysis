" It ' s quite tough for representatives to kick the habit of thinking for themselves or serving their constituents before their party said Dr J . Palacios Boix of McGill University and head of the site . " I see many MPs who come from a rough local background former city councillors , community activists and school board members who just can ' t say no to their constituents . The downward spiral usually starts with visible scepticism of party policy followed by outbursts at caucus meetings . They hit rock bottom when they ' re kicked out of their party and rambling about local affairs during Question Period . It ' s heartbreaking . "
