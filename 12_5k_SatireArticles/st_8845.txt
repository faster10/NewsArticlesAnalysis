Mr Spankerton told us , " I lost my sight a couple of years ago . I won ' t go into the exact details but let ' s just say my mother warned me it would happen if I kept fiddling with it . Anyway , it was very traumatic . I had to give up being a racist because I couldn ' t tell the difference between black and white people anymore . Fortunately I ' ve been able to continue as a homophobe because I can identify a gay just from their funny voices . "
