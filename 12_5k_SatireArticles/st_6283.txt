" I saw an ad just last night that , at first , seemed to be doing some good , but in reality was absolutely appalling , " said Pam Jeffries , an Iowa City mother of two . " It purported to show several different ways to say no to drugs , with one teen getting angry and saying , ' Get outta my face with that joint ! ' and another acting ' theatrical ' and delivering a Shakespearian speech to the rooftops of the city , shouting , ' Nay ! I say thee nay ! ' But when I talked to the kids at the teen center about it , they said it was silly and made fun of it ! They were laughing and imitating it , shouting , ' Get outta my face ! ' and , ' I say thee nay ! ' and just generally mocking the whole thing . If any of them ever die of an overdose , it ' ll be as if that ad pulled the trigger itself . "
