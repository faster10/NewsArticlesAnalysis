" Brian Wilson took nearly a decade to complete Pet Sounds , but the all time record is still held by Steely Dan " said Sanctuary Records President Johnny Mitchell . Radio went from FM to CD to XM to MP3 in the time it took Becker and Fagin to complete their last album . " At Sanctuary we were willing to give Axl enough rope to hang himself , but once he started turning blue , we cut him down and took him to rehab . It turned out to be a good decision . "
