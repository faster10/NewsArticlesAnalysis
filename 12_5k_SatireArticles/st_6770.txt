" There was a time when they , and I , simply couldn ' t predict when an impulsive lovemaking session would break out , " said Sutcliffe , who admitted that he hasn ' t needed to move his camouflaged camcorder from its tripod in months . " You don ' t have to examine hundreds of hours of recorded footage to figure out that sex has become a chore for the Hobsbaums , " Sutcliffe said .
