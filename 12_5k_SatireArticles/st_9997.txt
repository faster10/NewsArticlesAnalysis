The program is being implemented on a trial basis at the North Portsmouth branch of the Bottomfeeders grocery chain . First day results were good , the Homeland Security official reported , with fifty four people placed on the No Shop list and fourteen outright arrests , mostly for shoplifting or indecent exposure during strip searches . Bottomfeeders ' s management was less enthusiastic , however , with a store spokesperson complaining , " At this rate we won ' t have any customers left . " She also questioned Homeland ' s policy of detaining suspects in the store ' s warehouse areas . " We have to feed and house these people , " she said , " and pretty soon we won ' t have any room left for our deliveries . "
