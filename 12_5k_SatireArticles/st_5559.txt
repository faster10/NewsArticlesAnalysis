" For instance , Mark Turner recently made an excellent point about the excessive nature of Mike Tomlin ' s fine , which I ' m now reevaluating . Likewise , Sean Farnsworth ' s remarks had me rethinking the league ' s attitude toward protecting quarterbacks , which he believes comes at the cost of aggressive play calling by defenses . "
