What ensued was probably one of the strangest things I ' ve ever heard of . I manged to track down the butcher who was working at the time Christopher came in with Piglet . Butcher Bill had this to say , " I swear , that guy kept talking to this fat ass pig . It was a really creepy . He sounded like a stalker Hannibal . " Before Christopher and Piglet went into the butcher room Jonathan was heard saying , " Yes Piglet . The meat is in here . Aren ' t you feeling round . " About a minute after the two ventured into the butcher room , there were pig screams and the sound of a meat cleaver swinging . . .
