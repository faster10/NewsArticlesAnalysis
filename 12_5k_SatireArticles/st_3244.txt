Thus , the question becomes not whether freedom or free will can exist , but whether its existence or degree of causality is sufficient to the task of self preservation . To the degree that it is not , and cannot be , one must then ask whether the human awareness of this insufficiency is experienced in a fixed , universal sense , or whether it varies demonstrably according to personal predicament . Moreover , is self knowledge , as defined in this inquiry , truly possible ? It is our conclusion that while self knowledge may in fact be achievable by some degree of measurement , it is certainly not possible to the degree that true freedom , as it has been traditionally posited , is in any way tenable . While the illusion of true freedom may have numerous practical applications , vis vis the causality of certain commanded drives , its existence as a universal concept is purely theoretical , and may only be valued as such .
