According to a shaken casting director who barely escaped the grisly scene , a group of actors auditioning for a small guest role on CSI : Cyber turned on the show ' s producers Monday afternoon and began systematically stringing up cast and crew members from a stoplight at a nearby intersection . By evening , minor celebrities , including John Larroquette and Raven Symon , were seen crashing a star studded screening of The Jungle Book at the El Capitan Theatre , where they allegedly stormed the red carpet with machetes and massacred each of the movie ' s leads in front of the paparazzi .
