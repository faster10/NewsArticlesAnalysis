" It turns out that Dyson have patented the solar power toaster with their Dyson Cyclonic Toaster , " said Kobs . " So we ' re kind of in limbo . The Dyson toaster is a good toaster , using ionic cyclonic air movement to toast the bread without any heat transfer that could burn your hands , but who wants cold toast ? They had found a way to make it solar powered though and now the iToast4 is on hold while we untangle the patent infringement . "
