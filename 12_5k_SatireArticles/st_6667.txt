Against all logic , the nation ' s citizenry , their insides withering away with each passing moment , somehow managed to continue filling out invoices , shopping for footwear , loading dishwashers , eating Whoppers , pressing buttons , watching reality based TV programs , vacuuming floors , engaging in conversations about petty office politics , riding buses , sitting in traffic , mailing letters , and tending to the little rubber mats people wipe their feet on as they enter the lobby areas of vast , windowless industrial complexes . How they managed to do it , no one can say .
