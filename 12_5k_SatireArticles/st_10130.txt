The murders appear to be in line with methods used in the Halo franchise to dispose of enemies and considering the disposition of the gentleman seen earlier at the bar , the police have named him a suspect . This man described as approximately 5 ' 10 " , brunette hair , with glasses ( see rendition above ) . He was wearing a red tie at the time with a Microsoft tie tack . On the back of his car , a silver 2007 Corvette , there were a number of bumper stickers , one reading " Zune : Take a bite out of Apple " and another saying , " Yes , it ' s me , and you ' re poor " . The best bit of evidence comes in the license plate from Washington State which reads " Arbiter " . Any leads on this suspect should be called in to Bungie HQ immediately as there are police on hand to receive your information .
