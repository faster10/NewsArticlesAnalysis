Thus , we can state emphatically that the original , ancient , and proper " freedom of the press " written about by James Madison , and understood by the founders of this nation , was for there to be a freedom to publish by the use of a machine called " the press . " An obvious corollary of this is : modern media is not protected by the First Amendment , and therefore Congress should act to heavily restrict and squelch this modern media . We must heavily regulate and cripple this ( new ) media , all of which are unimaginably more powerful than the media of the eighteenth century . We need stiffer penalties for the unlicensed use of media . We need regulations to keep the media out of the hands of criminals . And we need common sense rules for even newer versions of " the press , " which are now capable of publishing millions of newspapers , books , and ( YES , I WILL SAY IT ) magazines per day . This proliferation of large capacity media magazines must especially be curtailed . Just look at the countries which have stopped the presses , and see how successful they have been in controlling the media : Communist China , Laos , Iran , Venezuela , North Vietnam , East Germany and the U .
