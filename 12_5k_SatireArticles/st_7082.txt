Dateline : LOS ANGELES There ' s a hot new product that ' s flying off the shelves . It ' s called Gravitas Jaws and it consists of a crude plastic mandible bone that ' s worn over your lower jaw like a beard , except that this piece of plastic has the power to force everyone to take you seriously for no good reason . Donna Kerplunker , CEO of Upstart Entertainment , which manufactures Gravitas Jaws , says her R D department was inspired by female and male TV news anchors alike who typically have chiseled , square jaws , which studies show cast a magic spell on the television audience , forcing the viewers to take the anchors seriously even though the anchors are empty headed egomaniacs that read from teleprompters and are neck deep in the dehumanizing business of infotainment .
