Standing under the gleaming white metal poles that he once swung from by his Triple X Fruit Of The Looms , Christie told the crowd , numbering at least two dozen in attendance ( mostly summer school students that had failed math and were forced to go outside ) that he decided to announce his candidacy in this very place , to show that Americans can confront their darkest fears and overcome any obstacle . " I remember that day like it was yesterday , " told Christie , with a well placed tear in his eye . " I remember thinking , with my ass bleeding , that I might not ever get out of this situation much like the infamous bridge gate scandal that my enemies have tried to pin on me . But look , I did get down from this football pole and I have managed to scallywag my way out from underneath the Ft . Lee Traffic Jam debacle as well . And I did it all while wearing the very same pair of patched up underwear , too . I ' m actually wearing them today ! "
