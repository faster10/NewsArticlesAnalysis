In Monday ' s exhibition basketball game in Washington , D . C . between the United States team and Brazil , the kiss cam focused in on the President and First Lady during the first half of the game . Even though it stated on the jumbotrons in the auditorium that it was a kiss cam , and even though the Mr Obama moved in for the lip lock , and even though Vice President Joe Biden leaned in to encourage Michelle to kiss Barack , she wouldn ' t do it .
