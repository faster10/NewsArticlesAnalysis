" Steven is only four , so normally I ' d say , ' Only two hours a day , and no HBO . ' But after all he ' s been through , I figured I ' d forget the rules and just let him watch what he wants , " Knabholz said . " Yesterday , I even let him stay up late to watch The Road Warrior on Cinemax . When he sees something he likes , his little eyes get so big and wide . . . I just don ' t have the heart to say no . Considering that I have to work at the supermarket all day and don ' t have much time to spend time with him , that TV has really been a godsend for the boy . "
