Gore said that in the past 12 months , he and Tipper have " rekindled the flame of passion " in their marriage , taking time each day to lavish attention and affection on each other . Citing one such example , Gore said that last Friday , he came home from a speech at the American Bar Association ' s annual convention to find Tipper waiting for him in the bedroom in a lace teddy with a rose between her teeth . She then handed him a book of " love coupons " redeemable for a variety of sexual favors .
