" No , " explained Ohio ' s Executioner in Chief Dewey Morder , " it ' s not the same thing as hanging . For one , you don ' t put a noose around the convict ' s neck . We ' ll just let another convict strangle the death row inmate . And two , you don ' t have to waste tax payers ' money building a gallows every time there ' s an end of life event . Additionally , with strangulation , we are using the human capital we already have at hand to put to death er , end the life of the death row inmate . "
