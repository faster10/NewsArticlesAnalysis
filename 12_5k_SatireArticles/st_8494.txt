" Yeah , Patrick Berger is a bit unfit at the moment , " said Ince . " But he was never very quick anyway . The touch never leaves you . Sander Westerveld isn ' t as sprightly as he once was he was probably in his fifties at the time but with diligent stretching I ' m sure he ' ll be able to limber up again . I think our biggest problem is Nick Barmby . He ' s at Hull for god ' s sake ! It ' ll be like trying to re learn the game . "
