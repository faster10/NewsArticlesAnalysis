" I ' m Tom DeLay , son . I make laws . I change laws . Haven ' t you heard of the DeLay Protection Act ? The very idea that some peon like a District Attorney would think they could impugn my character just because I broke a few silly Texas campaign finance laws is ridiculous . Those laws were never meant to apply to me . We ' re talkin ' the intent of the law . If that Ronnie Earl wants to make a case against me , he ' s got to get past every Republican and Democrat I got under my thumb ! " DeLay retorted .
