The comedian concerned , Paul Whitemouse , denied emphatically that his ' Unlucky Alf ' character was in any way based on the unfortunate case of Dr Foster , and vowed to defend the claim vigorously . Fortunately for Mr Whitemouse , the contract for his recent run of advertisements for the Aviva insurance company , purely by coincidence , included a clause providing him with full legal insurance protection against claims by deranged Yorkshire doctors . A spokesperson for Aviva confirmed that that they had already taken steps to instruct one of the country ' s leading barristers , Rowley Birkin QC , to conduct Mr Whitemouse ' s defence .
