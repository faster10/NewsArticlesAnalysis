" I served my time amongst the environmentalists , conservationists , crusties and bums . And I was great . But at the end of the day , it comes back to Yin and Yang , which as we all know are dependent opposites that must always be in balance . When I became involved in the environmental movement , environmental degradation was occurring much faster than environmental conservation . I helped to redress that balance , but because I was so successful , it got to a point where conservation outstripped degradation . To put it abruptly , Yin was shafting Yang , but now Yang is shafting Yin . Hopefully with Jaguar , I can help to even things up again . "
