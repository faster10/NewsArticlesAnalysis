" The higher your level , the more Pumpkin Kash you ' re eligible to win in the daily lottery , just by signing in , " said Conner , explaining that Pumpkin Kash is a PumpkinZonia currency distinct from Pumpkin Points , and is exchangeable for an entirely different range of online services and products . " You can use Kash to get PumpSkins for your favorite web browser , to put up billboards in downtown PumpkinZonia , or even to buy a Platinum Plus membership , which gets you access to more activities and a lot fewer ads .
