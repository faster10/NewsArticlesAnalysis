According to officials , the museum was founded by prominent historical revisionist Henry Fleming , who in 1968 donated his private collection of burned government papers concerning the relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II . Since its unannounced opening , the gallery has featured such exhibits as a retrospective of the construction of the First Transcontinental Railroad consisting solely of a toy electric train that circled around a locked box containing records of laborers ' working conditions , as well as a room devoted to the Trail of Tears that contained no doorways by which to enter .
