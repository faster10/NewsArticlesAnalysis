Judd Harrison , Director of Public Relations for Domino ' s , elaborated on the new system : " The program works like this : As soon as a customer ' s order is received by a local Domino ' s dispatcher , a virtual clock starts in Domino ' s internal tracking system . If the pizza hasn ' t reached the customer ' s front door within 30 minutes after the clock has first started , it ' s a fair bet it won ' t be arriving at all and customers should start making other dinner arrangements . "
