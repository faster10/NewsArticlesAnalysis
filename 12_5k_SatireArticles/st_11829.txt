Perhaps I should listen to my friends , or actually make some friends outside of the pleasant yet arms length acquaintances I hope will one day bolster my alibi . I imagine friends would tell me the secret to meeting a girl is to put myself out there , which is admittedly tough between my late night stalking and my full time job at H R Block . Besides , it ' s not like Old Man Manson ever had to bother putting himself out there . He ' s locked away in a maximum security penitentiary and still managed to have his pick of ladies . No awkward Speed Dating ' nights required .
