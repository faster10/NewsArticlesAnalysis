The imam also expressed the hope that the Australian government would see sense and introduce Arabic as the national language to replace English . He added that it is a logical follow up to the introduction of Sharia Law , since The Holy Qur ' an can never be properly and adequately translated into languages less perfect than Arabic . He explained that " The Holy Qur ' an was revealed to Mohammed in the perfect language Arabic , which is the language of Allah ( ' Praised May He Always Be ' ) . Therefore to translate it into any other language would corrupt the holy words . "
