" John McCain has backed a war that justified and necessary as it may be is deeply unpopular with voters . He has undercut his own POW story with his support of torture , and frankly , while he is my friend , I think you ' ll have to agree that every public appearance of John McCain is a potent argument against John McCain . He simply can not hope to win a presidential election . If I were hoping for a Republican President some time in the future , I would be thankful God only made one John McCain .
