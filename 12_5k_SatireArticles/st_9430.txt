Miss Gavina goes on further to suggest that exploratory sex with members of the same gender can often be beneficial , " because most boys are simply looking for release and nothing more , and other boys will understand that mentality . While girls , on the other hand , often want to be caressed and treated lovingly , which other girls will also understand . Sexuality should be balanced and pleasurable for everyone involved , " she concludes . Mr Lancer is equally excited about the project , stating that , " Young men generally don ' t have a clue about erogenous zones outside of their own , which is a shame , really . I think this class will help them be more patient and generous during their performances . "
