The girl detector worked like this : using the computer ' s built in video camera and microphone , the operating system built user profiles that attempted to determine which consistent users were adult females . Once the user was calculated to be an adult female , the system then listened for tell tale phrases such as " Honey , how do I . . " , " Hey , sweetie , tell me again how to . . . " , " What ' s that password again ? " , " Why won ' t this print ? " and other phrases and questions that the detector was programmed to interpret as coming from a less than expert user . That profile was then flagged by the system and placed in the " Let ' s phuck with her " cache .
