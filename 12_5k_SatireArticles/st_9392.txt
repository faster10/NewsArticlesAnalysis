Workers at the local " Black Bear Car Wash " in Seattle say it has really become a problem when it gets to the " clean up " stage for these drivers . " It ' s so gross to have to vacuum these cars out . Boggers clog up the vacuum hose and we have to stop and clean them out . There is nothing worse than a bogger covered with rug fuzz . We place a complimentary box of Kleenex in each vehicle we clean now , but we know these pickers probably won ' t use it . The same people come back again and again with their rugs full of goo . We call them repeat offenders . '
