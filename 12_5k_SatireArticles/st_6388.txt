The NAQA is known for its quick and aggressive mobilization when it believes Third Amendment rights are at risk , and has rushed to the defense of homeowners it believes are being illegally coerced into housing American soldiers . Last month , 200 NAQA members marched on a private residence in Fairfax , VA after receiving a tip that the owners were being victimized by three Navy seamen demanding prolonged quartering . They ended their demonstration , however , when it was discovered that the sailors were brothers on shore leave visiting their parents .
