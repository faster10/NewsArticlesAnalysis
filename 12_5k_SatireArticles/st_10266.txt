Just before close of business on Friday , Harding went into his local Washington Mutual branch office in Irving , TX with a pistol and a tan canvas sack . Bank teller James Hopper was unprepared for Harding ' s behavior . " He has been coming in here about once a week to make a deposit , and dispute some fees , but I was completely in shock when I saw the gun . " Following his training Hopper pressed the silent alarm , and slipped the marked bills into the canvas sack . " It all happened so fast , " Hopper said " I was a nervous wreck , but Mr Harding was surprisingly calm . "
