" There ' s no way I ' m going to keep exploring the galaxy if it ' s just going to make me feel like a complete dipshit for ever believing that my planet was anything special , " said astronomer Samantha Wilhelm , stating that if her team discovered a planet that was even better than HD 904790 b , she would " kill herself on the spot . " " I even tried observing Neptune for a while in hopes that that gaseous sack of crap might make me feel better about being stuck on Earth , but it didn ' t work . I can ' t get HD 904790 b out of my head it ' s ruined the goddamn Earth for me forever . "
