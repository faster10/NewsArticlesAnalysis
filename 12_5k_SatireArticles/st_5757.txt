" As caretakers of the most prominent public building in the second largest city in Iowa , this library can no longer afford to take chances , " library director Glenda Quarles said . " Due to our limited budget , we can ' t devote the kind of resources and manpower to security that , say , the Library of Congress can . But because of our high profile and easy access , we feel a strong responsibility to ensure the safety and well being of those members of the public who visit and use us . "
