" And so it is with regret that we state our disapproval of Mr Trump . His political leanings and experience are not well known . As Dark Horses , we cannot attest or vouch for Mr Trump ' s pedigree as a Dark Horse . His appearance on the scene as a Presidential contender is a long shot that is not indicative of a true Dark Horse . We ask all Dark Horses , in Manchuria and abroad , to stand against Mr Trump as a sign of unity . The Society of Dark Horses hereby and formally proclaims that Donald Trump is not the next Dark Horse candidate for the US Presidency . "
