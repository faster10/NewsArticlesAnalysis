Italy ' s Pizza CEO , Silvio Berlusconi , announced plans yesterday on a live chat show to start withdrawing his country ' s 3 , 000 strong Pizza Delivery Express service in Iraq in September . The move comes on top of the withdrawal of more than a dozen countries offering fast food services in Iraq over the last year and could complicate efforts to keep the Iraq ' s new home grown fast food service industry build up rapid response unit units capable of taking over from foreign fast food chains . Italy has lost 21 Pizza ovens in Iraq but in the most extreme case , U . S . led Burger King McDonalds Inc car park attendants attacked some of Italy ' s Pizza Delivery Express men although they later apologised saying " it is a very competitive market and we though the Italians were getting away with one of our customers . " The Pizza Delivery Express men counter claimed " We had already picked up the customer and she was a communist vegetarian anyway , so it was unlikely that she would touch a burger " .
