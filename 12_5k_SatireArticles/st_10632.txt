Robert Gibbs : I have not received additional information , but I can assure you that business as usual has been exaggerated to outlandish proportions . I mean , if I got a dollar every time a Chicago Pay to Play went down , or when a paragraph was slipped into a Congressional bill to nudge some tax dollars toward some friend , well I ' d never have to work another day in my life . Washington DC has been like that for something like 600 years , so everyone should focus on something else .
