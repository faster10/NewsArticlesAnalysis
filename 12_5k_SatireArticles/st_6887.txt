" I was walking my dog Shadow when I heard someone call out to me from above , " Bird said . " I looked up and saw Jason sitting on a tree branch . He told me he once had a dog like Shadow . Then he asked me to come on up and see the view . I don ' t usually do stuff like that , but he was so cute and intriguing that I tied Shadow to a bench and joined him up on the branch . We sat up there for two hours eating golden raisins and reading jokes from this kids ' joke book he fished from the trash . It seemed magical at the time . "
