I think I speak for everyone when I say , I ' m pretty damn confused these days . What with the cultural appropriations , sexual orientalizations , racism , reverse racism , assessibility issues you name it . I ' ll be talking to one of these young people and I don ' t know if they ' re a transgender , a cyst gender or a digital native , for all I know ! LGBTQ ? I mean , what are we talking about here ? Sex or alphabet soup ! ?
