" They ' ll be waiting and waiting for a lucky month and then bongo bingo bango hizzah . Sorry I haven ' t spoken to anyone for a month , except that time I had to give directions to a Polish guy to Tesco . That was a special day . Thanks so much for calling . Do you want to buy a house ? We have one on our book . Really pretty . The book that is , not the house , it ' s a dump but I ' ll take any offer I want out of property I ' m going to live with my mum . She ' s really good and I ' ll only pay 38 a week rent . she wanted 55 , but I brought her down . Really I ' ll take any offer on the house . I bought it in 2007 for quarter of a million , must be worth 500k now but I ' ll sell for 57 . Go on , be a mate . "
