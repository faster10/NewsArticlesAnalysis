" Initially I was unconcerned with the actual picture quality of my evil broadcasts " He told the magazine , " But when I saw some of the really bad propaganda cartoons of the imperialist west , I realised that nobody actually knows what I look like ! The mole on my left cheek for example , has several black hairs growing out of it and this has not been picked up by the old JVC steadyshot pro , now the Sony PC120 can show that and even some of the egg in my beard !
