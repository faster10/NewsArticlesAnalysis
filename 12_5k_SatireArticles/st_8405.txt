Sally Jones , hairdresser from Rhyl , commented , " I ' m not surprised . We had to have some luck some time , especially after Woolworth and the Abbey National closed down . It ' ll be great for the B B business round here . And of course they ' ll all want something to eat . I think we deserve it . I like Sepp Blatter . Schwytzerd tsch sounds like Welsh , don ' t you think ? And I don ' t believe they ' re corrupt , they just share their money . I mean , I lent 20 pounds to Janice last week . She spent it on nail varnish . Do I mind ? ! "
