" Robert became obsessed " , explained Manitoba Lake , of Celebrity Mucus Magazine . " He wouldn ' t let it go . Kristen just wanted some quality time in between shoots , to chill and cultivate her trademark constipation chic look . You know , lounging and hanging in the toilet with anti diarrhoea medication for her bowels and 18th century arsenic face paint to bleach her sullenly pouting sulky features . But Robert just kept dragging her on hikes . He wanted to spot every one of the region ' s 200 Living Fossils such as the scaly hen and the sabre toothed dormouse . Not to mention the smooth billed water pigeon . Oops , too late !
