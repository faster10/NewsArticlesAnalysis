" Take the Department of the Interior in the ' 80s . They kept saying that if James Watt left , they ' d all go their separate ways . Well , Watt left , and the DOI is still going strong . And I can ' t even count how many times the British House of Lords has broken up and reformed in the past 50 years . When the harsh reality sets in , the high court will see what few options they have and cut the bluster . "
