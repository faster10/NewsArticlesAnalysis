" Sheriff , I know that you have endorsed Donald Trump . Let ' s say that he was one of your prisoners . How would you dress him ? " " Good question , Rachel . First of all , He wouldn ' t be allowed to wear that albino raccoon head piece that he currently wears . However , because of his stature , I would probably consider working with his London tailor on a grey with blue vertical pinstripe ensemble . With that , possibly a pink shirt with a cloudy grey and black stripe power tie by Gucci . As far as underwear , I understand that he presently wears a tailored , Fruit of the Loom , knee length , jockey ball hugger model . I suspect it ' s a knockoff . But I have no problem with that . "
