Bruce Connolly an Australian back packer who witnessed the event on his day out to Parliament told me , " I could smell the tramp as he pushed past me . It was definitely excreta I could smell . Then when I looked closer I saw that the shit was on the old bum ' s hand . And then the Prime Minister didn ' t want to look as if he thought he was better than the little guy , especially with all the press about , by refusing to shake his hand even though he was already retching from the smell .
