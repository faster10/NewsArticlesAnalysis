" I want you senior citizens to know that these smartass grandchildren of yours will have to pay for your Social Security , Healthcare , and whatever bills we can think of to stick on their backs , we will make workers out of them yet ! Hell , maybe we can get them to pick cabbage and show them how to be like the many good undocumented workers we have , who should be citizens if it wasn ' t for those mean whippersnappers who keep calling my office complaining they shouldn ' t have to pay emergency room bills for good , honest , undocumented citizens !
