Noticed by fishermen standing alone on the top of an iceberg Ericsson dove into the frigid water and swam to the fishing boat . Kran Norgidsson , captain of the small craft thought Ericsson was mentally unbalanced at first . " He dove into water barely above zero degrees and then when he got to the boat he spoke in what sounded like Norwegian gibberish . When we could not understand him he threw up his hands and began to order us about . I couldn ' t understand him , but I understood what he meant , the way he pushed us around . "
