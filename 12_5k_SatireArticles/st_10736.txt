Everyone needs to understand that since that " terrible day in September " the world has changed . Without choice , we , as a nation , have become engaged , caught up as it were , in a great world struggle . . one between those who would keep their own people in chains like that of Iran , Syria and North Korea versus those , like us , who want our own people to remain free so we might be allowed to partake of the wonderful benefits of those having had the opportunity to live in a democracy . We , as a nation , cannot . I mean we must not allow evil to triumph for if we do , if we fail to have the courage to carry out the God given mandate that we protect the world ' s right to choose for itself , then freedom and democracy will be lost forever .
