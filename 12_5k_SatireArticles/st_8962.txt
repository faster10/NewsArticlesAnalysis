Stadium builders Dave Bling and sons , of Ilford , say that the increase in costs are mainly due to global increases in fuel and food prices . " The cost of a barrel of oil is higher than it ' s ever been " said Dave . " Crude oil is converted into petrol via distillation and alkylation , and so our van costs more to run . And tea bags have got well expensive lately . We get through about 400 tea bags each during a typical day we have to pass that cost on to the London 2012 people " .
