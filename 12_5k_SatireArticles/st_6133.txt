To conduct the study , researchers split the staff of a Washington based insurance company into two groups and assigned each group a series of tasks to be completed by the end of the day . The control group engaged in normal workplace activities , such as standing around and talking , staring vacantly at the computer screen , and surfing the Internet . The other group was instructed to do work and complete its given tasks . Incredibly , the group that did not do any work failed to get any work done , while the group that did do work finished all the work .
