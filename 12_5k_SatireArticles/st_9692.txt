John Boehner ( R Ohio ) : We have to focus on the 2016 Elections , and not the next two years . We know why Democrats lost the Congressional seats they got in 2008 . . . . Democrats did not abolish Presidential Term Limits in 2009 , and in 2010 voters punished them for not giving Obama permanent White House control . By the time 2013 had come around , Democrats failed to nullify the existence of the Supreme Court , the Senate , and the House of Representatives , and voters punished them in 2014 by making them the minority party on both sides of Congress . . . . If the GOP wants to win in 2016 , we have to surrender Absolute Power to Barack Hussein Obama as soon as possible , and then hope everything will be fine .
