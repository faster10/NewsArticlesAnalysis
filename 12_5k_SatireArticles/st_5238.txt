" I was wandering around the neighborhood by myself , much like Moses wandered the desert for 40 years , when I saw a sign for a church rummage sale , " Dunne said . " I was only at the sale a few minutes and didn ' t find anything , so I was just going to buy a brownie and leave . The two women at the brownie stand started talking to me , asking me questions about my life and stuff . I was really taken aback by their interest in me . It was nice . "
