Weather Channel meteorologist Jim Cantore is being credited as being the source of this advice regarding the life jackets . Jim is advising folks with pets to order life jackets for their dogs and cats via overnight delivery . Jim further advises that folks can make their own life jackets from pieces of styrofoam that can be found in recycling dumpsters behind Dollar stores and such . He says these dumpsters are relatively clean and that he often finds bubble wrap and other materials that he uses to wrap items he ships on eBay .
