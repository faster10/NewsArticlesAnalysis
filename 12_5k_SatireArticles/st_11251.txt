Bogans are stereotypically considered to be young adults . ( from approximately 15 to 30 years of age ) Older males who would otherwise be described as being " bogans " are sometimes known as yobbos . Employment occurs primarily in the building or agricultural industries , with the main consideration being a requirement for unskilled labour . Low to midrange literacy and intelligence , ( 80 100 IQ ) and above average physical strength are also prominent elements . They can primarily be observed in suburbs along Melbourne ' s northwestern corridor , ( although related variants from other states exist ) with greater numbers tending to the outlying semi rural areas due to increased opportunities for unskilled employment . They also have a tendency to be xenophobic and highly nationalistic , and so are therefore likely to avoid areas of large multicultural concentration .
