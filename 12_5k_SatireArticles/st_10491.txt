Paramedics were unclear as to how Miller ' s penis actually got close enough to the bear trap or what triggered it . " The trap was attached to the wall approximately 18 inches from the urinal , so it seems unlikely that anyone could accidentally injure themselves while urinating , " stated Jared Taylor of Estes Park EMS . " We arrived within minutes of the accident . As with any dismemberment , we attempted to recover the severed member so that it can hopefully be reattached . Unfortunately , it appears that Mr Miller ' s penis fell through a hole in the floorboards . "
