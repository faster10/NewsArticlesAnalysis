Dangerous Dunker Duncan as he ' s now known locally claims it ' s all a big fuss over nothing . After wiping some crumbs away from the corner of his mouth , he told us . " So I dunked a rich tea in my coffee . Big bloody deal . There ' s no warning sign saying ' Dunking rich tea biscuits in coffee is prohibited ' . Come to think of it , it ' s a bleeding tea room . What are they doing serving coffee anyway ? They should have a look in the mirror before having a pop at me . As far as I ' m concerned it ' s a storm in a coffee cup . Ha ! See what I did there ? "
