Some people say that when you lose a limb , sometimes you can , like , feel it there , even though it ' s not , and like , it hurts . But I ' m having like this weird feeling where my legs should be and , like , I can feel all of these awesome trendsetting items that should be there , but aren ' t , and it ' s like stuff that isn ' t even cool yet . It ' s like I have psychic phantom legs syndrome and they ' re telling me that lyra bell bottoms will soon be in , or like striped pantyhoes , or like , aquamarine low rise skirts made of a blend of denim and silk . I dunno , I just get this feeling .
