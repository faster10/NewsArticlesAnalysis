In July 1996 , Dolly the sheep was cloned by the Roslin Institute ( part of the University of Edinburgh and nearby biotechnological company PPL ) . Dolly ' s birth made her " the world ' s most famous sheep " thanks to the BBC News and Scientific American , but sadly , Dolly only lived six years . She died of a progressive lung disease . Some scientists blame Dolly ' s premature death on the ill effects of cloning after a more thorough investigation , however , it was discovered Dolly was smoking three packs of unfiltered cigarettes a day . A farm hand who ' d grown romantically involved with Dolly provided her with the tobacco , Seiglefreed said .
