Pitt is so smitten by the young checkout girl , who has never been properly kissed , that he can barely bring himself to open his mouth around her . However he did manage to once as he proudly recalls , " A month ago I was purchasing soap and I eventually just about worked up the courage to say , " Hey is this good soap ? " She responded by mumbling , " Yeah I guess " . That was the about as much as she has ever said to me . I was so thrilled . Later that night I couldn ' t sleep . I was tossing and turning in amorous fantasy . Jennifer had to sleep on the couch that night . I kept thinking I should have said something witty though like , " Hey if this supermarket is selling it , it ' s bound to be good soap " but it ' s true what they say , the best lines always come to you the day after " .
