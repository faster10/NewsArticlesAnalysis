We need to carefully scrutinize " the freedom of speech , or of the press . " These two clauses clearly state that Congress cannot abridge the freedom of two things : " speech " and " the press . " Now , speech is used here as a control . We all know what speech is : it represents the words and utterances of a speaker . We know this of a surety . This definition has not changed in two hundred , nor , should I say , in 500 years . There are modern interpretations of this particular instance of speech , in this particular Amendment . Courts attempt to alter the meaning to say that the giving of money is " speech " for First Amendment purposes . There are other , more basic reasons why courts fabricate new meanings for the word " speech , " but the vast majority of us understand what Madison meant and what the First Congress understood in 1789 . They passed , and submitted for ratification to the several States , an article that would make the freedom of speech a right of the People . And enough of the States had ratified it in 1791 to make it the Law of the Land . Thus , " speech " is a Constitutional right of the people .
