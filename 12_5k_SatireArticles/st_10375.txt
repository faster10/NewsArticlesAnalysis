Now , Kell Logg has apparently stepped up their efforts against people like Bill . Sending two tons of cereal to homeless people sounds nice on the surface . But it has Michael Phelps picture on it , so Kell Logg isn ' t actually being charitable because the company ultimately has it ' s own self interests in mind in getting rid of cereal they feel is " bad for their image . " It ' s cereal especially for kids , so it ' s jam packed with sugar a bowl of Frosted Fakes is 38 . 7 sugars , more than 1 3 by weight . And the homeless in San Francisco aren ' t any hungrier than the homeless anywhere else , so some wonder why Kell Logg would go to the trouble of shipping its sugar laden donation halfway across the country to people who engage in the same activity they dumped Michael Phelps for ?
