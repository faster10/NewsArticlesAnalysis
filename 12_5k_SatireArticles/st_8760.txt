' We had all been well aware over our collective years in government of Lord John Prescott ' s ' little problem ' shall we say , and he has stepped forward with an idea we are keeping on the back burner should the nuclear plant plans not win public support . ' Old Punchbag ' as we affectionately called him has had a longstanding irritable bowel problem , and produces excess amounts of flatulence on an unusually mammoth scale . He was well known for emptying the House of Commons in 5 seconds flat after PM ' s questions , but it appears his problem may become our solution . There are now secondary plans for a wind farm , powered solely by Lord P ' s farts .
