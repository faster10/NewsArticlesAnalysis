The boy ' s grandfather has sworn to defend Guilder at all costs . " It was a horrible ordeal . I intend to get back at those TSA brutes for this . We are going to storm the castle , Guilder and me . We have Miracle Max to thank for getting us motivated . We have something worth living for , and it ' s not the TSA . " Mr Rugen counts his blessings every time he sees his grandson . " I want to read bedtime stories to my grandson . I don ' t want to fight the TSA ' s inconceivable procedural handbook . If they are going to start a war , then leave the boy out of it and let it begin with me and Guilder . We take no captives , I must admit . We are men of action lies do not become us . "
