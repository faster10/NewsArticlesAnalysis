Reverend Wright came out for ' Red Lining " in Chicago , saying , " we missed our chance to do the same when all those Irish , Serbs , Greeks , Wops and Pollocks forced our people out of the ghetto , cleaned up the streets remodeled those buildings and cut neighborhood crime . Now all we have is a bunch of fancy restaurants , art galleries and antique stores that attract all those rich tourists and gave all them lazy non union whites thousands of jobs . no wonder Blago got railroaded and Jesse junior never made it to the Senate ! "
