One such team member , Doug Graves , 19 a serial job seeker from Liverpool , told our reporter : " I was on a cheap holiday wiv me mates like in Magaluf like , our room was on the twentieth floor like , so I downed a few San Miguels opened the window and hurled meself off the feckin ' balcony like . It were feckin ' great like , I hit this sun lounger and bounced across the pool landing on the concrete . I fractured me skull like , snapped me right wrist like and broke all me feckin ' fingers on me left hand like . Drinking like most definitely effects your judgement like if I had been bleedin ' sober I would never have had the balls to do it . Thanks to the falling down water I currently hold the unofficial record for the highest drop so far , plus its cured me habit of knocking one out every night ! "
