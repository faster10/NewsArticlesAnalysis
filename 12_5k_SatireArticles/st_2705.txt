" My friend Linda came over Saturday and we spent the whole day making soap , " Brinkworth said . " We made some absolutely gorgeous shell shaped pink hand soaps and some wonderful oatmeal facial scrub bars . And it was so easy : All you do is dissolve lye in water , weigh out the hard and liquid oils , melt it on the stove to 110 degrees , stir until smooth , add fragrances , pour it into the molds you ' ve pre lined , wait for it to harden , cut it into blocks , and presto ! "
