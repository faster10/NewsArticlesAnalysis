Our horses were tired as my trail partner , Tough Ticklish Terry and I crossed the great prarie and entered Crawdad , the little Texas town that had received its terrible reputation as the home of Lyin George . It was a long ride from northern pioneer town of Port Angeles Washington after having been placed on the no ride the stage coach list . In fact if it had not been for the many friends along the way we would have never made it . Lyin George with the help of his notorious gang have convinced the western settlers that we are desperados , men that don ' t fit the standard consciousness , that is believing that he is an honorable Christian hombre .
