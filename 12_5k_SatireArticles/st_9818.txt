He claims that on his 31st birthday he went to his favourite Jazz Club in LA for a celebration with a few friends . Shortly after midnight he was approached by a " very attractive lady " . " I don ' t remember much about the preamble , " he told reporters . " But , one minute I was in the bar waving farewell to my friends and the next I was in my room with this broad sitting on my chest giggling . We had intercourse , naturally . But , it was the most empty experience of my life . She left immediately . I woke up the next morning utterly depressed . I thought maybe I had contracted an STD or something and went to my doctor .

From then on , I have experienced mood swings and an increasing sense of futility for which I am receiving professional help . I did not even get the woman ' s name . I should never have gone with her but she had this stunning figure , was very intelligent , had magnificent boobs and was hot as Vesuvius . I should have known better . "
