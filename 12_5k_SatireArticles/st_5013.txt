Local crime statistics indicate this ain ' t the first time by a long shot a truck been stoled round these parts past few months . Back about July , Doug Hensley had his half ton dually with the Hemi took from the Hardee ' s parking lot , even though he weren ' t in there but for 15 minutes . Furthermore , a UPS truck got reported as stoled in March , but that was because he left the keys right in there , and you can ' t do that , and anyhow , it turned up a couple blocks away .
