Back then , we had one TV , or radio , in the house not a TV in every room . And the TV had a small screen the size of a handkerchief , not a screen the size of the state of Montana . In the kitchen , we blended and stirred by hand because we didn ' t have electric machines to do everything for us . When we packaged a fragile item to send in the mail , we used wadded up old newspapers to cushion it , not Styrofoam or plastic bubble wrap . Back then , we didn ' t fire up an engine and burn gasoline just to cut the lawn . We used a push mower that ran on human power . We exercised by working so we didn ' t need to go to a health club to run on treadmills that operate on electricity .
