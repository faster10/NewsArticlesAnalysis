To test this theory , this reporter went into a black neighborhood in Atlanta , Georgia . I asked 89 people if Barack Obama should keep Sarah Palin as his running mate Vice President in the next election . Six people said yes , cuz she got a better ass than Michelle . Eleven people thought that Oprah was the Vice President , while nine thought that Dick Cheney was still the V . P . Of the remainder , only three answered negatively , and they all wanted him to pick a rapper for the position .
