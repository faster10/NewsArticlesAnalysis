Jesse Jackson of the Rainbow Coalition demanded to be interviewed for this report . He refused to answer direct questions , however , and went and stood behind a pulpit and gave this statement : " My brothers ! We must unite against this discrimination that is infecting the white race against our heritage and our culture . We must put down these unsoulful actions . Halt Honky Hating Homey Hour ! Please Pan Pale People Programming ! Reject Racism ! There is a new day returning where the whites try to tell their children that they are better than ours ! We must stop these actions now . "
