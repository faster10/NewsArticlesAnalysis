When the Emmy Award for the Best Sports Show went to The Lingerie Bowl II , a strange thing happened during the acceptance speech . The offensive and defensive team captains of the two teams went to the podium together in their " football uniforms " to receive the award . As there was only on trophy for them to share , a fight broke out , similar to what occured during their game . The largest and longest standing ovation of the night was given by all of the men ( except the WIll and Grace cast ) in the audience .
