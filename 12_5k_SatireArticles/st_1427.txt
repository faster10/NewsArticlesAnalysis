" Most of the other DJs around here take music so seriously , " Haley said . " What they don ' t get is that music expresses the full range of human emotions , and that laughter is part of that range . That ' s why if I play something like June Panic or Songs : Ohia , I might lighten things up with a King Missile song or maybe even something by Hayseed Dixie , this funny bluegrass AC DC cover band . It keeps things from getting too heavy . I ' m sure my listeners appreciate that . "
