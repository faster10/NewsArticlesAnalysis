Dr Andi Medix , the IOC ' s official doctor said " Gender testing is not as easy as it looks . Everyone was sure that Linford Christie was a man . But he is really Louise Christie . It was a banana , a bloody big banana . And Fatima Whitbred had the body of a hod carrier . She never did give it back . Basically , you ' ve got to test the athletes when they are least expecting it . The high jump record was broken sixteen times last night . And that was before the competition even began . "
