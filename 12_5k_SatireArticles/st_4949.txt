" Ra is always looking down on me , beaming with pride , and making me a much better pitcher especially in day games when he casts a shadow between the mound and home plate , " Martinez said . " When I point my fingers up and look skyward after a big out , I am thanking Ra for his help . Oh , and sometimes I ' m asking the countenance of Juan Marichal that appears to me in the north sky what pitch I should start the next batter off with . He speaks to me through the stars . "
