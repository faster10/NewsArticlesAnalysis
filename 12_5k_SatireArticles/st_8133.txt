Cardinal Ricardo Uomo , Chief Technology Officer of the Vatican Bank , complained that " we have just updated our commodity futures derivatives trading programs to work with Windows XP . Now he His Holiness tells us this is all the work of the Devil . What am I meant to do ? Pour holy water in the drives , or install Linux or something ? Sure , we ' ve had a few problems with the licensing scheme , but I wouldn ' t go as far as the Boss has done . I wish he would leave well alone and not meddle with things he doesn ' t understand . If anyone ' s going to excommunicate the Microsoft QA team , I think it should be the Vatican technologists . "
