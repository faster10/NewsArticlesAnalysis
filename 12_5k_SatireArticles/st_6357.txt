They say that teams try harder when they ' re mad at the other team but I don ' t think that ' s true . I was on a softball team one year at OSN and every game I accused the other team of cheating even if I liked them . I always made the umpire measure their bats because I said they were too long by the rules . People began to say " uh oh , we ' re playing Alex ' s team this week , he ' s going to make the umpire measure our bats . " They did not invite me to play softball the year after that , although I would not have played anyway and that is true .
