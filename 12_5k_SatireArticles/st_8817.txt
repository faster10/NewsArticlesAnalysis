This is me fourth time inside and I ' m due out next week again , so once I get home and clear the backlog of mail and tidy up I ' ll be nipping over to service Doris and Muriel . Afterwards I ' ll be letting it all hang out again in Waitrose , aisle six , and within a week or two I ' ll be back here ready for the Christmas Panto , I hear it ' s starring Rolf Harris , Stuart Hall a few other celebs this year , should be a good one . Gotta dash I can hear the tea trolly coming ! "
