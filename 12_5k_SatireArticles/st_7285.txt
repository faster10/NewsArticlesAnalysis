" I didn ' t mind being deceived really , " Shuttlecock related . " I went to Cologne a few years ago , and there ' s pubs all over the shop . And state licensed brothels . So when Anne goes to the chocolate museum , I ' m reasonably certain that there ' ll be an alternative . So that we can both self indulge beyond belief . Mine will probably be a slightly sweatier experience nah , just kidding . I know everything there is to know about German : ' Ein Kolsch bitte ! ' sorted . We should be all right . I mean , we aren ' t Geordies or anything . I ' ve promised the wife that I won ' t say ' Auf wiedersehen pet ' upon leaving . And I swore I wouldn ' t mention the war or the World Cup . "
