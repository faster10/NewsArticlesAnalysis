The whole incident happened when San Francisco Giants hitter Angel Pagan hit a two out double off of the third base bag that would eventually lead to 3 Giant runs , a ball that normally would have been a routine out for Detroit third baseman Donny Crusade . Unfortunately for Crusade Pagan was no angel at all as he caused third base to bloat up and deflect the ball into left field , keeping the Giants inning alive and Crusade wondering about the actual intent of the angels in the afterlife .
