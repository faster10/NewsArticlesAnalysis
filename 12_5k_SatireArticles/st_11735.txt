Dr Langford feels emboldened by the results , remarking " we ' re absolutely going to continue and possibly reshape the survey . " Research staff have already been directed by Dr Langford to call back around 2 p . m . , after Johannson has had a bit of lunch , to see if the results vary . They ' ve been further instructed to tell receptionists that it ' s Wayne calling and Mr Johannson should know what this is about . " We ' ll see if we get different results now , " Dr Langford said hopefully , " I ' m optimistic . "
