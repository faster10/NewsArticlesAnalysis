However , recent developments in the Russian Space Program ( RSP ) have allowed the quasars to be placed in strategic locations behind the largest masses in the universe , clusters of galaxies . To date , the largest separation between two gravitationally lensed ( miraged ) quasars is found in the group SDSSJ1029 2623 , discovered in the year 2006 with a distance of 22 . 5 arcseconds . That ' s 22 . 5 3600 of a degree people . Potentially catastrophic space endeavors could have been undergone had our astrophysicists not discovered this . Thank God for American ingenuity .
