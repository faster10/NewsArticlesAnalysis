A spokesman for the union soon warned of another impending strike following the end of the strike , and the revelations of people using the airplane getting all of their luggage , straight away . " It is a profound show of how little respect these people show the workers . Not only will the customers now come to expect this everytime , the employers will as well . This union has already share with the press the dismay at the already high expected rate of 40 , and would prefer this to be reduced down to 25 . This would allow the workers to get on with the job they have now , of throwing , breaking , and occasionally losing your luggage , without the amount of stress already heaped upon them . "
