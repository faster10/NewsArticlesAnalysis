" If Craig gets Sundays down , he can pretty much run the dish station on his own , " Polone said . " Still , there ' s always going to be new stuff for him to learn . Like how to refill the soap and sanitizer reservoirs and prime the lines . Then there ' s all the politics , like getting along well with the chefs so they ' ll bring you their dirty pots right away , before all that stuff gets dried up and has to be scraped . There ' s always something new . "
