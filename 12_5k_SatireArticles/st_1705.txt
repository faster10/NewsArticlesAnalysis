" I ' ll ease the audience in by calling the Texas Double Whopper a ' sangwich , ' and Burger King the ' BK Lounge , ' but then I ' ll hit them with both barrels and call it the ' BK Lounge sangwich , ' " Cook said . " You can expect me to pace some , then squat , then probably growl like I ' m hungry , and say ' Huuuungry ! ' And to really hit it home , I ' ll climb up on the stool , howl , kick the stool over , and dive to the ground and do the worm . It looks totally spontaneous , but it ' s all carefully choreographed , and that ' s the beauty of it . "
