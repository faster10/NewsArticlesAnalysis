Mary Sugarsnap , 32 said " I was alone when it happened . My partner was off getting a cheese toastie from a food vendor , when I heard a popping sound . Next thing I know my whole world came tumbling down . It took my boyfriend twenty minutes to get me out , he had to finish his sandwich . I was so scared trapped under all that blue sheeting , I know how earthquake victims feel , and it ' s not pleasant . I was totally unaware of where the door was and felt totally trapped . "
