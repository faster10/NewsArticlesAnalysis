Alissa Meyer ' s sister , Emily , has recently checked into a mental institution stemming from an encounter at Giant Dicks . Alissa recalls : " Emily had just gotten her hair cut short and I thought it looked really cute . We went to the restaurant and the servers jumped all over her , calling her : Lame Judi Dench , crack addicted Michelle Williams and Les Mis Anne Hathaway . It was the last remark that really got to her . No girl should be compared to Anne Hathaway , that ' s just taking it too far . "
