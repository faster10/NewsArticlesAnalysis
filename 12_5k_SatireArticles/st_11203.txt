In spite of his frustration and his obvious disappointment , good things seem to be on the horizon for the former Prince of Peace . The Disciples will be airing a two hour roast on Comedy Central , hosted by Judas , of course . In attendance will be all the greats from Christianity from the Arch Angel Michael to Joan of Arc ( who will be attending while still protesting the title " roast " ) . Jesus , however , is looking to take some time to himself and re connect with some people he may have lost touch with . " I ' m going take it easy for a while . Peter and Paul are going to take me fishing . They retired down in Florida , live together . I try not to judge them , and it ' s legal in Florida , so whatever . Then maybe I ' ll go check out Moses he moved to Phoenix , loves the weather . Judas has made a killing in politics , so I might go see what he ' s up you . First things first , I ' m going to text Mary Magdalene she was always a good time , and it ' s been a while if you catch my drift . "
