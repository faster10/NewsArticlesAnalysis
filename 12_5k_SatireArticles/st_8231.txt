" Also John , I would like to add one more point here . Platini is half right about the injustice meted out during the 1982 France West Germany semifinal . In his opinion , the injustice was to France because the goalkeeper Schumacher was not sent off for breaking the jaw and spine of Patrick Battiston . However , the way I see it , the injustice was to the whole of European football because Schumacher should have actually broken Platini ' s jaws and certainly his skull during that match , but he didn ' t . That would have saved us all from this impending doom with Platini ' s current position as President of UEFA . "
