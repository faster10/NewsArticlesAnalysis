Murphy said that Christmas light manufacturers have made the situation worse by making it much too easy to put up lots and lots of lights . " Now we ' ve got nets made of lights for covering shrubs and those stupid looking icicle lights and any lazy guy on the block can light up his whole yard with little or no effort . Then he keeps the lights up year round as he sits back and pays his outrageously high electric bill , not considering that he ' s depleting the country ' s power supply . "
