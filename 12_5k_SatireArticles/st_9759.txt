Rick Stern M . D . , PhD . was quoted as saying " Psychoanalysis is about giving the analysand the dignity of being understood as a complex individual , worthy of full self realization . This is not a quick and simple processes . Fifteen years , for one hour five days a week is average . Eight years starts to raise eyebrows . This Rosenblatt kid had people in and out in 6 months feeling great . While I don ' t begrudge or deny the results and welfare of his patients what he is practicing is definitely not analysis !
