All the while , the tree suffers a long and slow death . Its needles slowly wither and fall from the branches , as it is kept on a cruel life support , given the barest of water its base of where its roots used to extend . The tree feels the full pain of its existence and cries out tears of sap for weeks on end , as the burning lights wrapped around its limbs keep it in a bondage of spectacle to be gawked at by the practitioners of this barbaric undertaking . Presents wrapped in the dyed and mashed pulp from the bodies of other trees are made to sit underneath the pine , as a inhumane reminder of a fate that awaits .
