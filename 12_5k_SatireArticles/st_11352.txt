BMW is also carrying out research collaboration with two other UK based companies . The first is PlanetKnox Limited , a UK company that specialises in the design and manufacture of protection systems for a range of extreme sports through its popular brand Cold Killers . The production of a new ultra soft synthetic rubber version of the Cold Killer is in the development stage and also incorporates the new surface ribbing . It is expected that this new product will also create some additional demand in the S M market .
