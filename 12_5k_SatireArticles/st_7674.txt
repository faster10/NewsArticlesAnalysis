Adam ( aka " MS . LAMBERT IF YOU ' RE NASTY " ) has reportedly been upset over cancellations of his interviews and performances by ABC as a rebuke to his racy over the top performance at the American Music Awards . In response to his latest Disney stunt , he commented " it was totally unrehearsed , I just went where the music took me . . . . I ' m here , I ' m queer . . . . . I fly my freak flag high ! Get used to it ! I ' m not a babysitter , I ' m a performer ! ! ! ! "
