Ever since I was seven I have been a fan of Rugby Union . The thing was I was never good at playing it . My dad took me to my local Rugby Club called Oadby Wyggs when I was seven and I wasn ' t bad at the tag version of the game . It all went downhill when contact was introduced . I was never good at tackling and would always be shoved on the wing to avoid contact . Whilst on the wing I would engage in conversations with the parents on the sideline and not really pay attention in the game , resulting in me once making a daisy chain 12 flowers long .
