The main experiment has revolved around growing trees on a secret space green house , specifically apple trees . Due to the apparent lack of gravity in space , detached apples did not fall to the ground , floating wherever they liked . Scientists bred three generations of these trees to ensure any last remnants of Earth influence were eradicated , producing a crop of pure space trees . These trees were then returned to Earth in an exciting landing mission , and replanted on terrestrial soil . When apples grew , and later fell , the findings were extraordinary .
