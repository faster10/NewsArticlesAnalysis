" Oh , man , J ger , " said Streeter , shaking his head . " Graduation week at the University of South Florida is the beer blast of all time , and the guys and I were mixing J germeister with vodka for the crazy , mellow drunk it gives you . They say there ' s opium in it or there used to be , at least and deer ' s blood . But whatever ' s in it , for some reason , made me act like a lion tamer . All night , I ' d walk up to girls with a chair and , like , do this circus act . Of course , I don ' t remember any of it . I had to be told about it later while nursing the king hell hangover of all time at the graduation ceremony . Just say no to that shit , my friend . "
