Having suffered the loss of their national symbol , Wales has agreed not to recognise Winter and Spring . Welsh Prime Minister Shakin Stevens said : " We the people of the valleys , no longer recognise the presence of those 2 seasons . From now on we will have Summer , Autumn , Coldyness , and Warmitude . We would do away with Nature all together for what its done , however my entire record collection is made up of Naughty by Nature , and I fear I would be cutting off my nose to spite my attractive face .
