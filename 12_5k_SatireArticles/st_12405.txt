" For lunch , many of us stop at the local fast food place and grab a hamburger . We miss not having the greasy , fatty , burger and fries when we are forced to eat something that is supposed to be good for us . On the M M ' s diet , we replace that hamburger and fries with a brown M M to represent the bun , the beef , and the fries , a yellow one to represent the mustard , a red one to represent the tomato slice and the ketchup , and a green one to represent the pickle and lettuce . As with the breakfast , four of our candies will not add enough calories to work against the original plans of your diet . They will again , however , appease that hunger tradition of the Big Mac or the Whopper . "
