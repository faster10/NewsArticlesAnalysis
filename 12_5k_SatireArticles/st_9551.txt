" Christie is the caricature of a Third World despot . He has a vicious temper , a propensity to bully and belittle those weaker than himself , an insatiable thirst for revenge against real or perceived enemies , and little respect for the law and , as recent events have made clear , for the truth . He is gripped by a bottomless hedonism that includes a demand for private jets , huge entourages , exclusive hotels and lavish meals . Wall Street and the security and surveillance apparatus want a real son of a bitch in power , someone with the moral compass of Al Capone , in order to ruthlessly silence and crush those of us who are working to overthrow the corporate state . They have had enough of what they perceive to be Barack Obama ' s softness . Christie fits the profile and he is drooling for the opportunity , " according to Chris Hedges , a writer for Common Dreams , in a Jan . 13 online article : " The Trouble with Chris Christie " ( see : http : www . commondreams . org view 2014 01 13 ) .
