Presidential hopeful Trump was working out what his advisors termed a " weapons of mass hysteria " ( WMH ) campaign . He vowed to take down anyone he had to in his war against archaic standards of decency and was alarmed by the rise of rational debate in the presidential race . " Of course our main secret weapon is populist reactionary rhetoric and large group hysteria " , he is quoted as saying . He was pleased with the performance of his spin doctors so far who had successfully staged a number of outrageous spectacles that had given him lots of good press space . " Americans don ' t care what you are saying , as long as you shout loudly and feed them lots of hysterical emotions and impossible promises " , he said .
