The Herpes Defense has now become a part popular culture , with reports of it being used in every day life . Reggie Stanthorpe , from Media watchdog group , Media Connection UK recently said , " Herpes is like a modern day Moses , leading prisoners out of prison , getting people out of traffic fines , excusing kids for late assignments . It ' s no longer acceptable to blame traffic or ' the baby ' for running late for social functions , but it ' s perfectly acceptable now to blame herpes . "
