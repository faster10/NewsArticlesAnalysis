Behavioral psychologist Bart Black says , " All this ' dealing with effects instead of causes ' is a bit ridiculous . It ' s a little like sending in a swat team every time some hungry kid with no money sneaks in and steals a candy bar , then removing your inventory from the shelves and keeping it in a shed behind the store . The kid still has no money , and he still wants a candy bar . Do you think maybe he just needs a paper route ? " He added , " This is a typical response . The top of the weed has been clipped away , but the root remains . "
