Mr Cataract told us the tale of what initially seems like a feat of remarkable bravery . " I was sitting at the back of the bus picking me nose and eating it when the driver had a funny turn . Once he ' d stopped turning he slumped in his seat . Out for the count he was . Anyhow , I swiftly moved to the front of the bus and dragged the driver out of his seat , wiped the snot off my fingers and took control . The bus was doing fifty as I grappled with the steering wheel . All the passengers were screaming like scared little girls . It took me a couple of seconds to focus on the road and that ' s when I noticed a group of cherub faced little schoolkids on the pavement . "
