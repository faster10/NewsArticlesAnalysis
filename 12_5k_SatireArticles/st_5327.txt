" If you are an outgoing individual who likes striking up conversations with strangers , you are a source of constant discomfort in this world , and have nothing to offer but anxiety and pain , " said Dr Andrea Malcolm , chair of the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University . " People don ' t care that you once owned the same car or cellular phone as them , or that you loved it . They don ' t care about your opinion one way or the other . They just want you to stop making their lives a living hell . "
