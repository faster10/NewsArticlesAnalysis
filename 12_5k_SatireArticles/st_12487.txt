My mother , of course , would get a phone call from the teacher . That night at home , I ' d get a stern tongue lashing from my parents . My mother would also go out and search every store for a leftover box of Valentines so that I could give one to each of the boys ( and not embarrass her ) . I ' d refuse and get into even deeper trouble . One year , she ( my mother ) even came to the school and distributed these cards for me in the classroom ( to my eternal horror , embarrassment , and shame ) .
