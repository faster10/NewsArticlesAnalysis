No this is not the first time that Jesus has been in the ring . A few years ago , Jesus had a boxing match in a small Colorado town against the Prince of Darkness . But the match turned out to be rigged by Satan . He convinced the towns people into betting on him . He took a dive and later revealed that he bet on Jesus . He then took the money and invested it on real estate . Word has it that Jesus is taking this very seriously . So serious , that he is recruiting the best that the afterlife has to offer . Names like " Classy " Freddy Blassie , Chris Candido , and Heaven ' s newest accusition , Eddie Guerrero , have been brought in to train the savior .
