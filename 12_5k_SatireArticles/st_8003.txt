" Point made . I guess it will leak eventually . One of our interns this summer pointed out that most relationships have an empathetic partner and a selfish partner . The balance makes the whole thing work . In the U . S . , approximately 70 of our market is a selfish partner . . . only when you consider our global market does the average come back to about 50 . To serve this demographic , we added a shortcut to the keyboard , in the image of a violin , which starts a program to feed the needy partner with predetermined empathetic responses . For example , if your partner or friend sends a ' what an awful day at work ' text , your obligations can be minimized . The program responds with alternating " That ' s terrible ! " and " That sucks ! " and " What a D Bag ! " Whenever the complainer finally sends a pleasant emoticon , such as a smiley , heart or balloon , your phone will alert you that it is time to tag back into the conversation . Bloggers thought we were helping everyone be lazy with chores . That ' s ridiculous . We are just helping customers be lazy in relationships . Maybe by 2020 , we will have the capabilities to address annoying household chores the last frontier for the First World . "
