The 1906 Earthquake Deniers , a group reviled by Californians and scholars alike , held three days of lectures and roundtable discussions over what they call a " century long hoax " of exaggerated seismic activity in the Bay area , and part of a conspiracy to bring the World ' s Fair to San Francisco in 1915 . Historians protested the conference , saying the organization ' s statements denying any major seismic activity in 1906 are reprehensible and out of line with all available geologic data from the time .
