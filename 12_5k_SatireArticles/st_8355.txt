" We did have access to an infamous video , but it turned out not to be the infamous video we thought it was , " said Goodell . " We watched the video for hours , days , months in hopes that it would provide some answers , but we did not see Ray , his wife nor even an elevator anywhere in that video . We replayed a lot of the stuff we saw , especially the ironing board sequence , but we couldn ' t spot Ray or his wrinkled clothes at all . "
