And finally Jose . Some people believe your attitude and way you play the game is detrimental to football . They accuse you of being rude and disrespectful in press conferences and behaving like a general twat during games . Your teams are boring and uninspiring while your greatest managerial achievement is probably squeezing the joy of the game out of Joe Cole . Why did you come back nobody but shitty tabloid newspapers missed you because , like them , your a raving bellend with the likeability of a open , pus filled sore ?
