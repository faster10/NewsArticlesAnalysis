One stay home Louisiana mother , who had known Lynn Spears during her teens , stated " I can ' t believe that Lynn would let this happen , sorry to say , she ' s a bad role model for her kids . " Another mother said " I don ' t think its right for her to encourage this behavior , I thought that Jamie and Britney were to separate people , but in behavior they ' re just the same . My daughter will not watch anything involving that wretched girl ! "
