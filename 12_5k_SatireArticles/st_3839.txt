" It all depends on how you tabulate the miracles , " Cornell University biology professor Dr Isaac Gregson said . " Eighty three billion includes not only all the humans who have ever been born , but also all the Cro Magnons , Neanderthals , Australopithecines and other proto hominids going all the way back to the first mammals . Of course , if you were to include the rest of the vertebrates in the animal kingdom , it would be even higher . And if you were to also include plankton , unicellular microorganisms and all plant life , the actual number would be closer to , say , umpteen gadzillion . But why quibble about numbers at a time like this ? Darryl ' s birth is a one of a kind special moment that has deeply inspired the world , reminding us all of just what it is that life is all about . "
