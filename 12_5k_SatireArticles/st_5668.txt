" Up until now , poetry has been , I think , more Mycenaean : grand , heroic epics that take hours to sing , with the rhythmic meter pounded out with a big stick , " the poetess said in a recent interview . " And though I love Homer , really , I ' m a big fan , I ' m trying to do something new and lyrical . Being a Lesbian , sure , it ' s caused some controversy . The island culture here on Lesbos is largely untouched by Pylos , Crete and the kingdoms of the Eastern seas . Even the influence of the Lydian Empire on the mainland is muted . But the lyric meter is something the fans are really responding to , and I ' m proud of that . "
