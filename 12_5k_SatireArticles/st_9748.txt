But the Secretary wasn ' t finished yet , revealing that " another key piece of this plan , once all the resettlements are complete , is that everyone who remains in the US must be fully immunized at all times , to include all available vaccinations . They will be required to wear a patch containing micro needles controlled by a microchip that inject vaccines whenever their titers fall below the required level . As an extra layer of protection , vaccine dusting drones will be used to spray populated areas periodically . Everyone will undergo titer testing annually , as part of their mandatory health physical , and be revaccinated as needed until their titers are raised to the necessary level . If and when their titers don ' t rise high enough , they will be resettled to Memuruland . "
