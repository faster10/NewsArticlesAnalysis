Society has always demonstrated a quiet ambivalence about homosexuals , transvestites , transsexuals and gays , with very few people knowing the difference and most people being afraid to ask . Homosexuality was thought to have been imported to England by the French during the Norman Conquest , with William I ' s son William Rufus being the first practising homosexual , according to the Doomsday Book . Hence , the medieval times are often associated with homosexuality , which explains many everyday phrases , such as " I ' ll get medieval on your ass " . By contrast , many Saxons were simply described as " merry " or " gay " . The best known of these was well known outlaw and forest dweller Robin Hood , who used to live with a large group of men all of whom wore unusual clothes for the times . Historians now believe that Robin Hood may have been homosexual , which would mean that homosexuality predated the Norman Conquest .
