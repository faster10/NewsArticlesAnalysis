Though most experts agree that the vast herds must be thinned , they are divided on how to go about it . Some are calling for the hippies to be spayed and neutered and then placed in designated preserve areas , where they would be free to roam peacefully and play hacky sack . Others suggest more extreme measures , advocating the use of large , headshop shaped traps to lure the hippies . Once inside the traps , the hippies would be poisoned with super adhesive , cyanide laced Guatemalan blankets and sweaters .
