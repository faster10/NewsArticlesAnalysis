Suicide Bomber Barbie was almost Mattel ' s first political statement , but management chose to maintain the corporation apolitical position , at least for now . Daisy Garcia has more ideas , though , and says she won ' t stop trying . " I believe , " said Garcia , " that Barbie can be the ambassador to speak for so many issues going on in the world . I ' m currently working on an Abu Ghraib Barbie , but I ' m not going to spill the beans until I ' ve got the bugs worked out . "
