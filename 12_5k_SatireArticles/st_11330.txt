PHNOM PENH , CAMBODIA Earlier this week , in Southern Cambodia , a team of attractive , racially diverse and sexually open minded archaeologists uncovered an artifact with a crude carving of Christ depicted as a vampire . An inscription beneath the drawing read ' De Sanguine Cristo ' , meaning in Latin ' On the Blood for Christ ' , a slight variation of the traditional Christian passage , ' De Sanguine Cristi ' , or ' On the Blood of Christ . ' The Christian understanding of the passage is the cornerstone of their faith in which participants receive the body and blood of Christ in order to participate in a divine union with God . With this discovery , that belief is deeply threatened .
