" It wouldn ' t be as big of a problem if they had their own separate Jew section , but they ' re right in my face every day , " said Hussein , adding that he " can ' t fly more than five feet " without hearing angels speaking Hebrew or playing " Jew music " on golden harps . " It ' s like I was telling Timothy McVeigh the other day : I ' m sure they ' re no happier to see me than I am to see them . So if we just had our own segregated areas of the Kingdom , we ' d never cross paths , and we ' d all be a lot happier . Simple , right ? "
