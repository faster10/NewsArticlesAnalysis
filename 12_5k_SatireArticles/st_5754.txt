" The secretary was not pleased when he was informed of the pothole , " Transportation Department chief of staff Joan DeBoer said of LaHood , who reportedly began his diatribe by walking directly up to the fatigued road surface and asking it straight up who it thought it was , and whether or not it even wanted to be a part of the nation ' s road system anymore . " We told him we would take care of it , but he was so angry he got into his car and drove right to Baltimore . He said he wanted to ream out the pothole in person . "
