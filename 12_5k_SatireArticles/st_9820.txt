The Pope shot back in a Sunday Sermon before thousands at Vatican Square , saying the home interest deduction grossly distorts the housing market and eliminating it would lead to steady growth in the housing sector . He said also that criticism of flat taxes as " regressive " are " hogwash " and said poor people would be more than adequately compensated for slightly higher taxes by the deflationary impact greater competition would have on prices . The Pope quipped that he was " of course not talking about monetary deflation . "
