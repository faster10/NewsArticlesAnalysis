' I would only point out there are no Carols from other organized deity focused belief systems . Need I then say more ? ' Except to say , of course , brothers and sisters , we did not fight the war for this ! " declared Harman . " Though we shouldn ' t have fought the war , obviously , as Joni Mitchell rightly sang out . But since we did it must be made clear , we did not fight the war for this ! I wish you all an affirming experience of personal meaning , at this time of year and all times of year , consistent with the values and priorities that are most symbolic and collective in your individual or connection based multi person circle of unity .
