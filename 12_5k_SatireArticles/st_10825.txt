Conservative commentator Bill O ' Reilly praised the school board ' s decision . " Unlike arithmetic , Intelligent Counting explains how the numbers got there . Arithmelutionists will have us believe that it ' s just a coincidence that 1 1 always equals 2 . But it happens every time . Never a miscommunication . And how did the number 2 get there ? Arithmetic doesn ' t say anything about that , but Intelligent Counting tells us that the number two was put there a long time ago by an Intelligent Counter . "
