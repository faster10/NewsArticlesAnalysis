I was CEO of Hollinger International . The money was the property of Hollinger International . Therefore , it was my money to spend . Of the fact that I am and was completely correct and free of wrongdoing , I have no doubt . It is true that the money was dispensed mostly on dinners , mansions , clothing accessories and performances . These were essential to the smooth running of my vacations , digestive tract , and marriage ( of course not in that order ) and hence , to Hollinger International . Therefore , it was my fiduciary responsibility to invest company resources into living with the opulence of an Argentine .
