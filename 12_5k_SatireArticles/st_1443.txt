" Those kids were beaten up , pelted with rocks and universally rejected by their more popular peers , not only because they were smart and computer literate , but also because of the way they dressed and the music they liked . But the shootings sent a clear message to this school and this community : We hadn ' t done nearly enough to keep such misfits shunned and in their place . "
