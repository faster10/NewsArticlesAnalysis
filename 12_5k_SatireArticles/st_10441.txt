Under LAFU , as explained in the omnibus legislation , all Americans would be eligible for a complete autopsy every year at a charge beginning at 200 . " All of the work will be performed by professionals at 2 , 600 LAFU centers around the nation . Each practitioner will receive an intensive three day training course . They ' ll really know what they are doing , and they don ' t have to be doctors . Once the " Y " incision is made and all of the organs exposed the , LAFU practitioner will make sure everything is in the right place and looks nice and pretty . If not , the organ will be removed and examined , but not replaced , " Borden noted . " Why would you want a diseased organ put back ? That ' s just plain silly . You can also file a form requesting a transplant which takes only 60 days to process . If it ' s a critical organ , let ' s says a heart , we can get the paperwork done is about 30 days . Compassion for humanity is a key for the President . This plan is not just about money , " Borden reassured .
