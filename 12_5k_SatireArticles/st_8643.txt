In the preliminary ( or foreplay ) rounds of the final held in the picturesque village of Little Humping on the Hill Mr Quinn ' s chances of victory looked slim as retired gynaecologist Hubert Longstaffe took an impressive advantage into the later stages . Mr Longstaffe ' s excitement was premature however , as during a routine drug test he was found to have " unacceptable " levels of Viagra in his system . After a short inquiry , Mr Longstaffe was unceremoniously disqualified from the competition and left the arena with his head in his hands .
