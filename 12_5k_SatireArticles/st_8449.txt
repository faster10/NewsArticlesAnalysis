" He don ' t represent us like he should " said Cletus Buford , president of the Association in an exclusive interview . " He ' s been in Kentucky fer a long time now and he STILL looks like some New York EXECUTIVE ! Look at them fancy shoes with them little tassels on ' em ! Folks where we come from don ' t even WEAR shoes ! And those city boy suits ! He ' s been here long enough . It ' s time fer him to look like he belongs here ! Too high ' n mighty ! "
