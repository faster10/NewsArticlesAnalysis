" Julian was in high spirits . Why wouldn ' t he be ? His horse had just won him nearly five million that afternoon at Ascot . We were all there to cheer it on , of course . Many of us had backed it a eight to one . He often gives us tips . They don ' t always win . . . of course , but most do . Julian was throwing thousands to the waiters , of course . All the girls loved him . In fact , I would say he had slept with them all at one time or another . . . except me . . . of course . "
