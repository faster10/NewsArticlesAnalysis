When asked how he felt about sharing his most intimate secrets with all of America , The Macho Man replied : " Well , I ' m very excited about everything . This album is something I wanted to do ever since I saw my very first Ratt concert . I always envisioned myself singing into that WWF microphone instead of breaking it over Jake The Snake ' s head . Some people may be disappointed in my transition to rock music but , that ' s really where my heart ' s always been . I knew when I was in the recording studio that this was , truly , the only way to chronicle such a prolific career . As far as intimacy goes , I ' ve already been intimate with just about every WWF superstar since the eighties and , in the album , I cover those moments very thoroughly . I don ' t care if America doesn ' t understand The Macho Man , it never really has . . . "
