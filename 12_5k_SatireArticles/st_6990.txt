" Before the final out of Monday ' s routine 1 2 3 ninth inning , I was waiting for some sort of disputed play at the plate , fistfight , bench clearing brawl , fan interference , overturned home run ruling , bad managerial decision , heroic walk off hit by a virtually unknown role player , blatantly missed call , blood something to talk about around the water cooler besides the events that occurred on the field of play and the game ' s final outcome , " said Red Sox fan Tom Mizone . " If original scenarios like these stop occurring , there ' s nothing left but two major league teams trying to win ballgames . Why would I want to see that ? The pitching ? The delicate balance of raw power , speed , and agility ? "
