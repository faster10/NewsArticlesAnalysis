Finishing up his coffee , Creel becomes introspective . " You know , for me , Satan has always been about black T shirts and big crosses . It ' s never been about , like , descending into the Nine Rings of the Underworld . But when you play with fire you risk getting burned , and now I ' ve got soot all over my face and an appointment I ' d rather not keep . The good thing is , I ' ve got some time left here on this good earth , and I intend to improve myself as a person . Maybe , just maybe , God is watching . "
