The incident was spotted by eagle eyed staff member Vera Swingbucket . She explained what she had seen . " Well , I saw that the man had ordered a poncey coffee and some rich teas , which was a bit odd to start with . I just laughed it off really . Next thing I knew he ' d got this crazed look in his eyes and started to dunk the rich tea in his coffee . I tried to stop him but he was too quick for me . I had to go and have a lie down out the back on some baps to calm my nerves . The man is clearly a brute , no two ways about it . If it wasn ' t for the fact that our customers are so old they can hardly move , he would of started a riot . Hanging is too good for him . "
