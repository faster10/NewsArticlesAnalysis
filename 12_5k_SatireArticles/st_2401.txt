" When I used to spread old style mustard on my children ' s hot dogs , I never knew what sort of bugs were breeding between the buns , " said a woman quoted on French ' s website . " For all I know , microorganisms were actually feeding off the condiments I was squirting on my family ' s meat . But now that I use French ' s Antibacterial , I ' m reassured by the mustard ' s bright orange sheen , unique tanginess , and the little foaming bubbles that show it ' s working . That ' s a mustard we all can live with . "
