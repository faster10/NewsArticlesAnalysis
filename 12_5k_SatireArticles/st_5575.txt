" Obviously the defeat yesterday was tough , but we ' re confident we can get right back on track and win this thing in the end , " said Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades , adding that the GOP candidate " won ' t be giving up just because of one bad day . " " The country simply can ' t survive another four years of President Obama ' s failed policies and broken promises . We just have to regroup , reconfigure a few things , and continue spreading our message to the American people that the man to lead this country forward is Mitt Romney . "
