" All I ' m really saying is : lighten up . Call our planet Your Anus . If your children , upon hearing a news report such as yesterday ' s ' NASA has sighted rings around Uranus ' respond , ' So next time , wipe yourself harder ! ' and laugh well , let them . They need it life on your planet is grim enough as it is . We Uranians can take a joke , as we have a great sense of humor . Remind me to sometime tell you our funny ethnic jokes about how stupid the Saturnians are .
