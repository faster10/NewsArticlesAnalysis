" If people want a world in which they must lay burnt offerings before an earthenware household god to ensure that their car will start on a cold winter morning , I suppose they can have it , " said Father Thomas Reinholdt , theology professor at Chicago ' s Loyola University . " What ' s more , lesser deities are infamous for their mercurial nature . They often meddle directly in diplomatic affairs , abduct comely young mortal women for their concubines , and are not above demanding an infant or two for sacrifice . Monotheism , for all its faults , at least means convenience , stability , and a consistent moral code . "
