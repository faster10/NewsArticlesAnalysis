I made a bunch of phone calls this year , and some to the doctor , for things like a general check up and also I had to do a course of antibiotics because my cold was not getting any better . Sometimes it is hard to tell the difference between a cold and a flu . Antibiotics don ' t do any good for the flu and I was not sure WHAT I had , but I was coughing all night and hacking also . So , the doctor prescribed some antibiotics and some cough medicine also .
