TORONTO Musical group , Train , recently released their fifth album entitled ' Save Me San Francisco ' featuring the hit song Hey , Soul Sister to mixed reviews last week . The song , like pretty much any other Train song , features a melodic tune with lots of use of the word ' Hey ' and extensive elongating of the vowels . What is more apparent , however , and a growing trend among pretty much anything the group writes , is the choice use of words in conjunction with any sense of coherency , or lack thereof .
