Thank you also for the use of Air Force Two and the 70 Secret Service personnel who tagged along to be sure we were safe and cared for at all times . By the way , if you happen to be visiting the Costa del Sol , I highly recommend the Buenaventura Plaza restaurant in Marbella yummy lobster with rice and oysters ! I ' m ashamed to admit the lobsters we ate in Martha ' s Vineyard were not quite as tasty , but what can you do if you ' re not in Europe , you have to just grin and bear it .
