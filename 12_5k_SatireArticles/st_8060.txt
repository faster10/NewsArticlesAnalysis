Pluto and its moon Charon form a binary system . This means that the center of mass of Pluto and Charon is outside of Pluto and Pluto moves in small circles while Charon orbits it . So if you happen to get a taxi to take you to Pluto , you might want to make a stop on Cheron first , to get a bird ' s eye view of the little Planet that didn ' t quite make it as a real , rootin ' tootin ' planet but instead , got demoted to a dwarf planet . And scientists don ' t even know if Pluto is our Solar System ' s largest dwarf planet . Eris might be the top dawg of our dwarf planets making Pluto a whimpering , paranoid little sycophant of the Kuiper Belt shoved way , way , way , way out there by our Sun and our other Solar System bullies , like Jupiter and Saturn .
