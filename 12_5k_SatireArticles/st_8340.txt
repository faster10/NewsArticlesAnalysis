The culprit , then , is inactivity . I won ' t get into an argument over all the other points . Things like diet , lifestyle , age , existing illnesses . I mean , I could offer a protracted argument over all these points . But my concern , remember , is the World Cup . I hate it when people single out a popular event to draw attention to a study that extends over a much wider area . I want to protect the World Cup , and I mean to do it even if it shortens my life span .
