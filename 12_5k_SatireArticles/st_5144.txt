" Somewhere out there , this maniac is still loose , " assistant store manager Ted Conn said . " There ' s no telling how much ammunition he has remaining or how far he is willing to go in his mad pursuit of greater and greater savings at all Food Lion locations throughout the greater Middletown area . He ' s obviously highly resourceful , very intelligent , and single minded about discounts . All consumers can do is watch , wait and pray . And stop by your neighborhood Food Lion , where we have no choice but to pass these inhuman , tragic savings on to you . "
