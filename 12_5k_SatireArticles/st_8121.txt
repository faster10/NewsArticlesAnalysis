Springfield , Idaho Vern Kashinsky held the gas pump handle patiently until it reached 19 . 91 , then released and held a few times so that it would end on exactly 20 . He then shook the nozzle while it was still in his gas tank access port three times , so as to get the last few drops of gas . It is a process that this 62 year old man has done each time since the age of 16 , and one that he believes has saved him a fortune .
