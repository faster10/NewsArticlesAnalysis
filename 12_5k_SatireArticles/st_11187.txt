" It just goes to show , " says Peter ' s father , as he stood over his unconscious son , " if you push someone hard enough and oppress them for a long time , don ' t act surprised when they turn on you and rip your guts open . Now Peter can never use a gun or whip again . He ' s he ' s unarmed . " Then , as he walked out of the room , he laughed and laughed . " Unarmed . Damn this is going to be fun ! "
