A group of men and women were brought on stage , blindfolded and handcuffed . The blindfold was removed from the lead male . It was George Arsebourne , his clothes torn and face heavily bruised . Arseborne pleaded for forgiveness , he promised in the next manifesto to abandon tuition fees for students , restore students beer allowance for students and allow students to grow cannabis for recreational use and for profit . He was given a mild applause . Galloway turned to him and said years ago your head would have been resting on traitors gate while women knitted head warmers . I am sending you back to Clegg and Cameron with a message , We are coming after them . The chant OFF OFF OFF WITH HIS HEAD , HE ' S NO RED BETTER DEADgrew louder . Osborne and his team was lead away .
