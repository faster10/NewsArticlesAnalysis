The fact that those life forms can see us and they have the ability to manipulate us and yet they have not destroyed our earth shows that there is some type of unknown relationship . They don ' t see us as a threat because they exist at a more advanced stage than us . If our earth ages 1 million years then logic states that 1 million has to be added to 13 . 2 billion which is the age of those advanced life forms which means that 1 million years from now those life forms will be 13 . 2 billion years plus 1 million years ahead of us . This means that we will never be equal to those life forms no matter how hard we try because they will always have 13 . 2 billion times the power over us to try to be greater than themselves . Logic dictates that we can never have 13 . 2 billion times the power to try to be better than them because of the movement of time which caused the separation between us and them .
