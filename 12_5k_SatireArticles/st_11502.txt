Wal Kart has a special tactic they use to dominate their business environment . They first offer low prices until their competitors are driven out of business . Then they start to raise their prices because consumers don ' t have other retail stores to shop at and without other retail stores Wal Kart customers are unable to know if Wal Kart is charging them low prices or high prices . Customers then become dependent on Wal Kart and they lose their will to complain and struggle for a solution .
