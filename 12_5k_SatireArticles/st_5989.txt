" Do you know how difficult it is to get everyone situated , tuned , and focused for a vuvuzela concert ?

" These brash , inconsiderate outbursts of impromptu athletics have made us a laughingstock of the international music community . We have already had cancellations from the Vienna Boy ' s Choir and guest director Seiji Ozawa , who no doubt fear for their reputation should the Philharmonic continue to be mocked by these incongruous sportsmen .
