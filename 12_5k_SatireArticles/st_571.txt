" Take this past New Year ' s Eve , " Blakely said . " As much as I wanted to , I just couldn ' t leave the guy sitting in his apartment alone , so I was like , ' Hey , why don ' t you come along with me to my buddy Jonathan ' s party ? ' But then Spencer surprises me with these expensive tickets for a KC The Sunshine Band New Year ' s show . So , instead of going to Jonathan ' s party , I end up spending New Year ' s with Spencer , KC , and the goddamn Sunshine Band . "
