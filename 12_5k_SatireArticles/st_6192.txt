" You ' ll get as much out of this experience as you put into it , so don ' t hesitate to take on as many different projects as you can , " said account manager and internship coordinator Brian Pearson , 41 , adding that if any of the five unpaid interns ever found themselves without enough to do , they could always come to him for additional assignments intended for paid employees with at least two years of professional experience . " This is a great opportunity , so just try to take advantage of your time with us and learn as much as you can . Having the right attitude goes a long way around here . "
