Dick Cheney ' s history of heart problems has been widely reported . Nearly two years ago , he alleged that his heart had stockpiled enormous levels of plaque and thusly posed a threat to his personal security .

Mr Cheney as well as his physician Dr Powell cited other misleading and at times even fabricated medical records that , despite being dismissed by most experts , was sufficient enough to hoodwink the American health community into placing him on the donor wait list for a pre emptive cardiac transplantation or , as it is called in the medical community , a " regime change .
