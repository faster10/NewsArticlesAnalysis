" I ' ve followed politics all my life . In fact , most of our songs are highly civic and political . Brechtian almost . I mean ' Angie ' , ' As tears go by ' , ' She ' s a rainbow ' , you can ' t get deeper than that in terms of societal encroachment . I ' m not sure what encroachment means , but it could be on our next album . . Even Keith plays his guitar politically . Not a lot of people know that . . "
