' To be honest I am mightily hacked off . For years I have adorned the head of Uncle Brucie , the world ' s favourite game show host and catchphrase king ' Good game , good game ' and ' Didn ' t he do well ? ' and all of that cheesy bollocks that I ' ve had to put up with over the years , and what thanks do I get for it ? Where ' s my ruddy knighthood ? All I ' ve ever gotten is a cool wash in ' Daz ' and a quick tumble dry every 6 months . Think about it . I may be but a humble wig , but can you imagine Brucie without his syrup ? It ' s like Prince Charlie without his jug ears . . . . and I mean that respectfully of course . Oh no ! ! Do you think I ' ve blown me knighthood now ? Edit that will ya ? '
