Bush reported to American media on the invasion plans . " Hopefully tomorrow we will have taken Calgary and Red Deer . From there we will go straight north on Highway 2 and take Edmonton . If we can get all three cities in one day , that would be great . It will really lower the Canadian military ' s morale . From there we will go straight to the oil sands in Fort McMurray . Oh and I would like to take Banff and Jasper right away . I ' m dying to go skiing there . "
