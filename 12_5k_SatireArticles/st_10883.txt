For American Catholics , help may come in the form of " Father Joseph O ' Shea ' s Law , " a Congressional bill which would make it a high crime to investigate any Catholic for sex abuses . The bill ' s sponsor , Sen . Angelo Gianelli ( R MA ) , says that the legislation may prove a vital step toward ending the persecution of God ' s servants : " Nothing can give these priests their old lives back , the way it was before these children spoke up . But if we can hold accountable those monsters responsible for this investigatory behavior , we shall strike a blow for justice , and these priests can finally put their hideous ordeal behind them and get back to what they love doing . And the sooner the better . "
