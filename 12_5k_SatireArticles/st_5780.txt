According to Feingold , other carpool members get out of the car when they reach his house , tacitly forcing him to sit in the middle of the backseat , rather than simply letting him slide in . Feingold also said he rarely gets to choose the radio station for the morning drive , despite having politely voiced his dislike for Fred Grandy and Andy Parks ' WMAL Morning Show several months ago . In addition , rather than allowing Feingold to wait inside his house , the group insists that he wait outside on the sidewalk in the morning , in order to save time .
