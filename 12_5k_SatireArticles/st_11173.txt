Dr Alan Jones , Professor of Law at Nationwide University said that such legislation is very controversial and many people are concerned about how it would work . There is also concern amongst legal practitioners that leaving the definition of ' psycho active ' so broad might impinge on other person ' s civil rights . He added " If as has been suggested , ' psycho active ' could include common substances such as chocolate , then there is a great need to be careful and to define the word carefully . " He added that all Law practitioners will be watching closely and expecting a lot of work on arrests under the new laws .
