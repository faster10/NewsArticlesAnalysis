Moreover , when the Federal Assault Weapons Ban became law in 1994 , manufacturers began retooling to produce firearms and magazines that were compliant . One of those ban compliant firearms was the Hi Point 995 , which was sold with ten round magazines . In 1999 , five years into the Federal Assault Weapons Ban , the Columbine High School massacre occurred . One of the perpetrators , Eric Harris , was armed with a Hi Point 995 . Undeterred by the ten round capacity of his magazines , Harris simply brought more of them : thirteen magazines would be found in the massacre ' s aftermath . Harris fired 96 rounds before killing himself .
