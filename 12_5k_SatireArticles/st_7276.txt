" We were sitting on a park bench one night , " Bond said . " Eating pie and peas out of a polystyrene tray with a plastic fork . And right out of the blue , she turned round and told me that she loved me , and that there could never be another . She were only young , God love her . I remember telling her at the time that I wasn ' t the true love of her life . I remember telling her not to be so silly , that I was just a childish infatuation , and that she ' d find true love soon enough . I remember it like it was yesterday . I remember telling her not to fall in love with David Beckham , because he ' s a married man , or Gary Glitter , cause he ' s just weird .
