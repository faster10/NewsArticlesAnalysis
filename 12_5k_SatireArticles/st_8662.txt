Eventually the ' Daily Muckspreader ' heard about the potentially explosive story and sent John Hatchet , an investigative reporter , to find out what was going on . Mr Hatchet told us , " I managed to get a job with Athieva and was told I would be shadowing one of their collection agents , or ' Angels of Theft ' , as we now call them . I noticed that the agent was slipping something into the customers drinks . It wasn ' t until I finished my training that I found out what it was . The agent gave me a batch and told me to put it in all my customers drinks . At this point I legged it and began further investigations . After a couple of weeks I had enough muck on Athieva so we ran the story . "
