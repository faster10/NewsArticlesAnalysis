Speaking in a press conference Tuesday , Garneau elaborated on the terms of the competition . " Both men shall be tasked with constructing and executing a means of reaching the moon . Though each may elicit the assistance of up to two volunteers in designing the travel contraption , the voyage must be undertaken alone , with no interruptions or diversions , and the first man to set mortal foot upon the Moon ' s cold surface shall be proclaimed winner and true master of the cosmos . The prize shall be a modest purse of 50 silver coins , a roast pheasant , and the esteem of the world . "
