But , in a larger sense , we can not dedicate , we can not consecrate , we can not hallow this ground . The brave men , living and dead , whose remains and rubbish were dumped here , have consecrated it , far above our poor power to add or detract . The world will little note , nor long remember what we say here , but it can never forget what we have done here today to show the level of our respect to our fallen heros . "
