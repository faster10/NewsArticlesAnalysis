Grade 9Research has indicated that most students decide their gender identity and sexual orientation in high school . Therefore , the Ontario Ministry of Education has deemed grade 9 a pivotal year in sexual education , and focuses their curriculum towards understanding the factors that may impact such decisions . Students will be tasked with a special inquiry based research project in which they are tasked to map which gender identities or sexual orientation are tolerated by their own religions , cultures , families , and social circles . Should students still opt for alternative gender identities or sexual orientations , guidance counselors will direct students to appropriate resources , warning them of the associated social stigmas , career barriers , and lower chances of finding compatible mates .
