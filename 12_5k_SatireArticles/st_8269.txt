" The suits add a lot weight to the runners . Some of the taller men will have to carry an extra 9 kg of balls , plus the suit which weighs about 1 kg . That ' s an extra 22 pounds of balls to run with . But having 200 golf balls strapped to your legs , arms , and torso makes you run like a gazelle . As long as you keep the ermine fur rough , you will win any race you run . It makes the new Nike suits for Team USA look like old tires , " exclaims Stephen G . Wetmore , president and CEO of Canadian Tire .
