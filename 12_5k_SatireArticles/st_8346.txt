So much for guys that LeBron James grew up with . Dan Gilbert , Cleveland Cavaliers owner , said , " I ' m very disappointed , but if LeBron decides to play basketball later on this year , he ' s always welcome to come back to Cleveland . I hope he doesn ' t decide to play hockey this winter , that ' d really be a shocker , but that Stanley Cup is really a nice looking trophy . I don ' t think he ' s won one of those yet . I ' ll have to call ESPN and get the stats on that one . He ' s crazy about trophies . I don ' t think the money ' s even an issue anymore with Mr James . "
