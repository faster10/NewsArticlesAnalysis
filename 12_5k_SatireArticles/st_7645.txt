Predilleaux sees an emerging double standard . " You ' ll recall that zombies were all the rage about 6 or 7 years ago . Zombies were always shambling , slow witted monsters that just grunted and groaned the whole movie . Then Danny Boyle makes ' 28 Days Later ' , and all of a sudden zombies are a bunch of goddamn track stars . Seriously , the zombies in the original ' Dawn of the Dead ' were limping dullards . And in the remake , they ' re setting world records in the hundred meter dash . So now it ' s our turn to get a second look , and we ' re no scarier than some dude lugging his MacBook Air into Starbucks . We formally protest . "
