Since there are too many people on the earth and insufficient resources , the scientists had reasoned , either we find ways to increase the resource yield from the earth , or instead to reduce the number of humans drawing from the pool . Then researchers realised that for the vast majority of people , for the vast majority of time , the vast majority of their bodies and or minds were sitting idle . After all it is rarely we use both body and mind on the same task , and with the technology of the internet , it is possible and desireable to use the body less and less . Further many people hardly require the use of their brains whatsoever to function perfectly satisfactorily . As the majority of the resources used by a person is in fuelling their brains and bodies , the obvious solution is to ration the number of bodies available .
