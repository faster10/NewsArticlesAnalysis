Mexican citizens who ' ve endured years of bloody confrontation between the cartels and the government aren ' t the only ones who want the flow of guns to stop . Americans who want to ensure that crazy loners have sufficient firepower to kill as many random people as possible want it to stop , too . " There are weirdos on the Internet right now who are plotting how they ' re going to make headlines by their act of senseless killings , " says Clem Bloffer of the American Alliance for Personal Weapons Rights . " When they ' re ready to move , will they have the right tools available to them ? You can ' t be an effective mass killer of innocent people with a pistol , you know . Even a simple rifle won ' t do it . Today ' s psycho killers need the best available weapons in their arsenal , and its just not clear that these weapons will be available to them if they ' re all down in Mexico . This lunacy must stop . "
