NBA Dallas Owner Mark Cuban doesn ' t want to take away Donald Sterling ' s ownership of the L . A . Clippers . ( Cuban is the hyperactive out of shape guy , who sniffs the armpits of his players on the court after they win games for him . ) Opposing taking away Sterling ' s ownership of the Clips is probably because his fellow owners , who must now vote to force Sterling to sell , may undergo media scrutiny , which they certainly may not wish .
