A team of representatives from western corporations such as BP and Exxon visiting the congress announced that all new work and aid packages would be delivered at the local docks and in a spirit of goodwill would need many thousands of people to go on ship and help unload goods and items from the bottom of the hold . Further reiteration was stated that for the workers safety , they would need special safety manacles and were not to be alarmed if the ship moved in port as this would be barnacle cleaning in progress .
