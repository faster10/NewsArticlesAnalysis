Putin : " The dolts believed me when I said I would only bomb ISIS targets . Of course I first bombed the U . S . backed rebels and then pretended to be ignorant of the difference when they realized what was going on . Now they don ' t know what to do . We are in there already with our planes and pouring in new Russian troops everyday . The Europeans and the Americans are too afraid to do anything about it . This will be like Crimea all over again ! " ( He laughs loudly ) .
