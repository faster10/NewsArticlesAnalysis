When asked about the intern who created this idea , the representative replied , " That ' s the best part . Even though the United States Constitution specifically prohibits involuntary servitude , it is commonly understood that this principle does not apply to student interns . They are summer employees with virtually no pay , but employees nonetheless . So , their ideas are ' work product ' and basically owned by the company . Except when they have an actual litigious issue with the company , such as the lack of adequate pay . Then , we reclassify them as ' contract workers . ' It is really a win win for us . "
