Fulluvit finished by saying he was pleased with the Vatican ' s decision to draft children . Cardinal Derriere shook his head in agreement saying that drafting children for service in the rectory allowed the entire church to share the burden of sexual abuse in addition to sharing the cost . Furthermore , it was a just and Christian solution as no child should suffer abuse more than once . He was also thrilled with the idea that the draft would provide for an open and honest relationship between errant priests , their superiors , their therapists , and parishioners .
