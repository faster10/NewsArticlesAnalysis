The imam went on to explain that , under Sharia Law , all religions other than Islam will be banned . " Since Islam is well known as the one perfect religion the other , false religions , will no longer have a place in our culture . " he explained . It is expected that everyone will convert to Islam . Refusal will be a capital offence and those people who refuse to convert will be beheaded , after being forced to convert for their own good , by torture if necessary . " If any mis guided person criticises or even discusses The Holy Qur ' an , apart from praising its holy perfection , they will also be beheaded . " said the imam .
