" I ' m not going over to England to buy beer glasses that are most likely still in the experimental stages and aren ' t for sale anyhow . Do you really think those glass hoses that wind around in those " perfect beer glasses " actually are the best thing since mankind found gravity ? It ' s a lot of hype . You two knuckleheads are going to wind up drinking warm ale or lager , maybe even some concoction made from cider , out of pewter beer steins in some of the worst ghettos in London . "
