Karl Rove Defense ? Mr Bush continued with the sales promotion . When asked about the existence of the Karl Rove Defense Fund , given that Mr Rove has yet to be charged with any crime , Mr Bush replied that " we have to be prepared and plan ahead " . When asked how this statement could be squared with the lack of foresight as shown in the WTC attacks , and in the lack of preparation for Hurrican Katrina last year , as well as the lack of planning for the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , Mr Bush abruptly walked out of the informal press gathering making obscene gestures and muttering incoherently to himself .
