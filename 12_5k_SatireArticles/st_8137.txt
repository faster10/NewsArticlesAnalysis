I followed Professor Donnegal across the fields past a snow dusted soccer pitch and towards a rather dismal looking forested area . Near its edge , we arrived at a cottage similar to any one might find in the tiny English hamlets around this area , but this one had particularly high ceilings and doors . I followed Professor Donnegal inside and to my surprise , was met by a rather large trollish fellow with a beard and ratty hair . He must have been twelve feet tall and over half a ton in weight .
