Mel Gibson recently had a booze fueled ego meltdown of his own . After a wild night of partying at Malibu ' s Moonshadows , Mel declined several kind offers of a lift home , and began speeding down the Pacific Coast highway . When pulled over by concerned deputies , Mel proceeded to frighten the poor officers with threats of ruining their careers , and boasts that he " owned Malibu " . That he was in ' full game mode ' at the time is evidenced by his words to Deputy Mee , " I ' m not going to hurt you physically . I ' m going to hurt you . I ' m going to make you lose ! " Apparently drunken driving was no more than a game to one of Tinseltown ' s biggest ego ' s , where the real issue was winning or losing . This did him no good , since it was probably a terrified Deputy Mee who leaked the original arrest reports , as a way of covering his ass .
