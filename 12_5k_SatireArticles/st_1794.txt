" I ' ve been saying over and over that elected officials need to clean that filter , " said Houston resident Loman Barger , 62 . " You can ' t just clean it one time and forget about it , because once you get it washed out , a year later it ' s all gunked up again . God knows we don ' t ask those folks in Washington for much . The least they could do is check the damn filter every couple of months . "
