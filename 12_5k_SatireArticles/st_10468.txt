One of the nurses attending the birth , Brenda McChesny , confirmed that the baby boy , whose name is Aaron Boone Jr . , was indeed born without a single thread of clothing on his frail little body . " It was shocking , " said nurse McChesney , " you see , when babies are born , they ' re just wee little things and they need every once of protection we can offer . To bring one into the world without so much as a tiny frock , it just boggles the mind . "
