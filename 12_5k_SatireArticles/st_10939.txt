PAPUA , NEW GUINEA Scientists know it as " pacu , " but the natives of New Guinea refer to the same marine species as the " fellatio fish . " " It ' s a real ball sucker , " Jimmy Wade told this reporter . " Sometimes , the fish goes even further , becoming a real ball biter . " Several of his friends , " once powerful , virile men , are now eunuchs , " Wade said , " because they or their genitals had the misfortune of attracting the attention of the fellatio fish . "
