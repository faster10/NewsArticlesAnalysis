The winners of the match , to be held on 25th December 2009 , will be presented with the trophy by none other than God himself , who is set to make his first public appearance in two millennia . A spokesperson said , " God ' s appearance at the match will be exciting given that he is usually very private he will surely have something to say aswell , which should be a real treat for the fans that turn up " .
