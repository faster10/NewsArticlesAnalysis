Quoting from the FBI report , Ridge cited the example of an unnamed Egyptian born 24 year old male who settled in the Bronx in 1995 . Working days at a gas station owned by an uncle , the man attended nighttime business and English courses at a local community college . Upon graduation , he used his savings to acquire a partial stake in the gas station . It is believed that his hard earned elevated social status was instrumental in his marriage to a young Iraqi American woman whose own family immigrated to the U . S . in the late 1980s . Shortly after their wedding , the couple established a two bedroom breeder reactor in Manhattan , where they produced two children , with another currently on the way .
