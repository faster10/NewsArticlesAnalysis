" Astounding as it may sound , " Cal Tech physicist Lewis Sheehan said , " it may one day be proven that the Time Life continuum and the Time Warner force are linked to the so called ' Turner ' forces , which shape literally galaxies of stars , creating the ultimate in grand unified merge theory : the Time Warner Turner hypothesis . This theory , however , remains strictly theoretical at this point , as the conditions under which such a merger could occur cannot be generated within known science . It would require a hypothetical high energy state that only existed during the first few billionths of a second after the creation of the cosmos , and during a brief period in the mid 1990s . "
