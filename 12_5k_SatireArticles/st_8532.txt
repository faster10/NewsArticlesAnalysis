' Just think of Wimbledon with Vinny Jones as captain . Their tactics were to punch , kick , even headbutt the other players off the pitch , and they even managed to get into Europe , without a single tactic to do with soccer at all ! County will be easy to run . And any time another team dares to score a goal against us at home , I ' ll start a striptease in front of their fans , that ' ll soon make them and their team lose interest in the game ! '
