But as good as this offense is , the reality is this team is carried by its defense . That ' s where Norman comes in , obviously . He ' s been a mercurial talent the past few years but he ' s hitting his athletic prime at the perfect time including for his own personal finances and really putting it all together on the field . Previously iterations of the Panthers defense featured a ton of talent but this unit is loaded at every level . Kawaan Short is breaking out , the trio of Luke Kuechly Thomas Davis Shaq Thompson might be the best linebacking corps in the league and the secondary is tremendously underrated . Getting the most out of a low cost secondary is a hallmark of these Ron Rivera teams . And Charles Johnson hasn ' t even been playing !
