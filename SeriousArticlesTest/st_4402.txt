In sexually motivated abduction cases , a child will usually be held only long enough for the offender to engage in some amount of sexual activity . A few sex offenders , however , seem to want to believe they will live happily ever after with their abducted victim as a sex partner . In a few cases ( e . g . , Elizabeth Smart , Tara Burke , Jaycee Dugard , Shawn Hornbeck and Steven Stayner ) victims have surfaced alive many months or years after being abducted . Many parents of long missing children understandably pray that their children are among such victims .
