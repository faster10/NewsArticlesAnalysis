To my Academy colleagues , WE HAVE TO DO BETTER . Period . The reason the rest of the world looks at us like we have no clue is because in 2016 it ' s a complete embarrassment to say that the heights of cinematic achievement have only been reached by white people . I repeat ? it ' s embarrassing . It ' s unfair to the performers of color who sacrificed so much , laid it all on the line AND DELIVERED with their projects this year . It ' s also unfair to the white actors , writers , producers and directors who gave everything they had to create career defining content only to have it marred by the fact that a lack of diversity calls into question the legitimacy of The Academy ' s choices .
