Loud alarm bells were sounded on December 4 , 2006 , when the FDA issued warning letters to the New England Compounding Center and four other compounding pharmacies , directing them to stop producing standardized versions of medications that , according to the agency , were being " marketed for general distribution rather than responding to the unique medical needs of individual patients . " the center was cited for violations of FDA regulations in marketing four different drugs , including repackaged doses of the cancer drug Avastin into syringes for treatment of macular degeneration .
