What it really boils down for me is , the cultural change , another woman in Luntz s focus group complained . That s what has been driving the conservative movement for decades : Fear of desegregation , fear of feminism , fear of LGBT acceptance , fear of an empowered labor force . Republicans have been able to mold these fears into seemingly less repugnant ideologies like small government for a long time , but the system is collapsing as of late . That s why politicians like Trump and Palin , who don t even try to graft a coherent sounding ideology over the politics of resentment , are doing so well . But just because the conservative movement is being more honest about who they are these days doesn t mean that this isn t who they ve always been .
