On the form displayed thus far in Melbourne , the Swiss does hold a slight edge , though . Federer has played 16 sets in five rounds , dropping one to Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov in the third round , and has spent a total of nine hours and nine minutes on court . Djokovic , on the other hand , was stretched to five sets by plucky Frenchman Gilles Simon in the fourth round , throwing in a personal record of 100 unforced errors in a scratchy , far from convincing performance . The Serb has spent 12 hours , 35 minutes on court for his 17 sets .
