Shaykh Yusuf Qaradawi , Qatar Tariq Bishri , Egypt Muhammad S . Awwa , Egypt Fahmi Huwaydi , Egypt Haytham Khayyat , Syria Shaykh Taha Jabir al Alwani , U . S . : All Muslims ought to be united against all those who terrorize the innocents , and those who permit the killing of non combatants without a justifiable reason . Islam has declared the spilling of blood and the destruction of property as absolute prohibitions until the Day of Judgment . It is necessary to apprehend the true perpetrators of these crimes , as well as those who aid and abet them through incitement , financing or other support . They must be brought to justice in an impartial court of law and punished appropriately . It is a duty of Muslims to participate in this effort with all possible means .
