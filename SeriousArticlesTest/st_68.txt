Mario Cuomo was famous for the idealism he expressed in soaring oratory , but he had a prickly practical side as well . Cuomo , the political infighter , was famously combative : He frequently picked fights with the press and had a contentious relationship with the state legislature that included comparing them to clapping monkeys in one address . In 1977 , Cuomo famously ran three races for New York mayor against Ed Koch in a single year , a bitter string of campaigns that included a scurrilous flier suggesting Koch was gay ( Koch denied this until his death Cuomo denied any knowledge of the flier ) .
