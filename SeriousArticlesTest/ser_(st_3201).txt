With New England ranked 28th in rushing yards per game , a huge part of the Pats offensive success is due to their tight end Rob Gronkowski . The sixth year pro is not only the most dominant tight end in football , but Gronk is also one of the game s best players , period . His 6 6 , 265lb frame makes him a huge target that s difficult to take down , but his size betrays his remarkable athleticism and soft hands . Gronk s advantage over most linebackers is significant and along with Brady , he s the lynchpin of the Patriots offense .
