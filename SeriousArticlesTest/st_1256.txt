Scott Weiland : When I formed the band and created the Wildabouts with my friends , we decided we wanted to make a band sounding album , a rock sounding album . I made two solo albums before that were more experimental albums , and I think that they didn t really resonate with my fan base because they were too out there , too artsy . I wanted to make an album that would resonate with the fans and still make myself happy on an artistic level as well .
