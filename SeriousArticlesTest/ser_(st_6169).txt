In spite of continuing efforts to remove any reference to God from our public conscience ? from our coinage , the Pledge of Allegiance , our schools ? the dispositions and traditions of the American people still reflect a religious , indeed a Christian , ethos within which political leaders must govern if they are to achieve their personal aspirations . As long as the people as a whole have not rejected all public reference to God nor abandoned religious practices , and if principles based on religious teachings continue to regulate their societal behavior , it will be possible to maintain a spirit of virtue to advance the well being of our republic and its populace .
