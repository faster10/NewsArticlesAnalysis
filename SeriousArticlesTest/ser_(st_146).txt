Both candidates had the most fun talking about their right wing opponents . Sanders made a well placed crack about how he wants Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee . Clinton s ? unwillingness to give into pressure to back off her 90s era accusations about a vast right wing conspiracy ? instead arguing that it s right out in the open for all to see ? was equally fun . It s become cliche at this point to note that these Democratic events , with their civility and focus on ideas , are notable for how different they are from Republican events , which quickly devolve into a competition over who can be the dumbest and most bloodthirsty sounding . So it s nice to see the candidates talk out loud about how the other party is a sea of the worst , most irritating people imaginable .
