From an officiating standpoint the refs have been atrocious this season . I m not only talking about a few bad calls affecting my team I m talking about an abundance of bad calls , or no calls , and blatant regard for the rules ( Lions and Ravens lost games they could have won because a blatant penalty was not enforced . The league itself just doesn t care because they re not losing any money from it , like any other conglomerate . This isn t even remotely close to the NFL of the 80 s as far as product is concerned and its getting old fast .
