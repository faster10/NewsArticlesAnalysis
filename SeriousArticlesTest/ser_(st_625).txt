Unfortunately , Brown is not the only tenant caught off guard . According to the Center for Housing Policy , nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties , and tenants ' rights in such situations are minimal . In most states , when a bank forecloses on a landlord , the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property , and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure . So while the owners know what ' s going on , renters are usually kept in the dark .
