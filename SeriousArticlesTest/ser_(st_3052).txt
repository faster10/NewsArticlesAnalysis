LUCKNOW : The news of the formation of Indian National Army ( or Azad Hind Fauj ) in Singapore in 1943 under the command of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose was strong enough to infuse excitement and a sense of pride in 14 year old Suvendra Nath Roy , who not only secretly disseminated the message among his near and dear ones , but also installed a portrait of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose in the family shop located in Hazratganj , while eagerly waiting for the response of the onlookers ( both Indians and foreigners ) . However , his joys were short lived , as police came from the adjoining Hazratganj Kotwali , and told the teenager to immediately remove the portrait or face the music .
