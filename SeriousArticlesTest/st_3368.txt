Peter Head : We certainly do . One of the things we try to do now is something we call cultural planning . When we are starting a project we actually engage with communities and we do a bit of research on the history of the place : The way people have lived there , the way they ' ve interacted with nature , and with each other and then when we do the consultation . In Wanzhuang in China for example , we found that people had history of having dancing squares and all sorts of cultural facilities within their communities . So by retaining the footprint of those villages and the corners and little areas that they remember in the new development then it actually extends the culture which we find people respond to very well .
