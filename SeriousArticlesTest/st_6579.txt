The first doubts pertaining to Anita were conveyed to T N Singh on August 30 , 1979 through a letter from Arun Ghose , an executive member of All India Freedom Fighter ' s Samity ( Regd ) . It begins as follows : " I came to learn from the Calcutta dailies that you have cordially received Mrs Anita Pfaff , the so called daughter of Netaji Bose . You have been miscarried by cheap sentiments , because you do not know the background of this canard as well as the character of Bose family of the day . " Ghose writes , " The said girl is a posthumous child of one Co . Brizette of the then Axis Power . Her mother Mrs Brizette died after a few months of delivery . Emilie Schenkl , an intimate friend and close door neighbor of the Brizette family took up the orphan as adopted daughter . " Ghose alleged it is a conspiracy hatched by the Allies in collaboration with pro British Congressmen to assassinate the character of ardent bachelor Netaji Bose .
