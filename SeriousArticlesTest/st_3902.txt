Those Raiders teams went 1 4 and won the Super Bowl following the 1976 season . New England is 2 2 during this run , winning the Super Bowl last season . ( Thank you , Pete Carroll . ) . . . Bill Belichick has tied Tom Landry with his 10th appearance in a conference championship game . Landry was 5 5 , with two Super Bowl wins Belichick is 5 4 with four Super Bowl wins . . . In Week 16 , Belichick decided to kick the ball to the Jets to start overtime rather than put it in the hands of Tom Brady , arguably the greatest quarterback of all time . The Jets needed five plays to score the game winning touchdown . Otherwise , this game could have been in New England . . . Julian Edelman had 10 catches for 100 yards last week in his first game in two months because of a broken foot . Daily News stat genius Bob Vetrone ( BoopStats on Twitter ) points out that the Patriots are 22 1 in the last 23 games Edelman has played .
