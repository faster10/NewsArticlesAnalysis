The Redskins aren ' t a bad team , but they re not a particularly good team , either . They re an average team with the unfortunate problem that their biggest weakness is Carolina s biggest strength . Carolina is built to punish teams with a powerful ground game , and then clamp down on the passing attack as the other team tries to catch up . Washington has not been able to stop anyone on the ground , and its best deep threat has been hurt most of the season . It s not a good fit for them .
