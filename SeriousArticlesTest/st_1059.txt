Fishermen off Giglio say that the fish have changed , too . They are much larger and harder to catch after gorging on the ship ' s offerings . The freezers that have not burst under the water pressure are still locked with their rotting thawed contents sealed inside . Fridges too , filled with milk , cheese , eggs and vegetables , have been closed tight since the disaster . One has to only imagine leaving a home freezer a fraction of the size of the industrial freezers used by cruise ships unplugged for 20 months to get an idea of the type of rancid mess trapped inside .
