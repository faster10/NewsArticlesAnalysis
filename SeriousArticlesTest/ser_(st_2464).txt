This is all bad news for the Giants , but what will give them a chance at leveling the playing field is the fact that the Patriots offensive line is decimated by injuries . Last week , tackle Sebastian Vollmer left early with a head injury , and both he and Marcus Cannon ( toe ) are out for Sunday , leaving them with just Cameron Fleming as the only real tackle to be suiting up on Sunday . ( Fleming was on the practice squad until Week 6 . )
