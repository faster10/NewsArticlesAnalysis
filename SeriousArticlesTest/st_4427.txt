We had to register and queue to get an attendance slip for the exams . The female teachers told all the girls we would be searched as pregnant girls are not allowed to sit exams . We were made to line up and we were checked . They touched our breasts and stomach to see if we were pregnant The teachers told us the government told them to do this checking . They are ashamed to see pregnant girls go to school . The teachers talked to the students not to say anything and now we are frightened to speak about what happened .
