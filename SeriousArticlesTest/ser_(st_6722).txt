It was a very parental no . Final , but with some warmth attached . And it indicated a deep respect for either the other candidate or for the optics of cooperation , which often are ? exactly the same . I think that Sanders and Clinton have real issues with each other , but I also think that neither Sanders nor Clinton really ? want to fight with each other , and at the end of the day , despite the whiz bang of the zingers , neither do we . Beyond the artificial dichotomy of the debate , Sanders and Clinton are all we ve got ? two viable candidates against a stack of wildcards that are still funded and still in the race over on the other team . Of course , calling them ? Mom and Dad is reductive and gender essentialist I am being a little facetious . But there s a certain degree of unearned faith I m pinning on both that is the same desperate confidence we all invest in our parents , when we need to believe them when they say that they will keep us safe from danger . And it s not just me that feels it . ? As is the habit of kids everywhere , Todd rushed into the awkward camaraderie between the candidates with a too soon , too intimate question .
