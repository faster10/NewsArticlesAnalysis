Back to Jordan . That second year with the Wizards was the lasting impression we were hoping to get . He was healthier and able to train properly during the offseason . Body parts still hurt , but his legs were under him and his strength was able to work in conjunction with a bit more quickness . He shot 44 . 5 percent that year while scoring 20 points per game , grabbing 6 . 1 rebounds and dishing out 3 . 8 assists . Perhaps most impressively , he played all 82 games . This wasn ' t the championship Jordan we love to remember , and as such , he has , over the years , become a victim of his own greatness , because of course those Washington years could never live up to his own standard . But they were great in their own right .
