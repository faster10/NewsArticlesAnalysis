Joan Rivers was a role model to comics everywhere , but especially to women . She got the first laugh and the last laugh . I learned from this . When the kids in school taunted me because of the way I looked ( 6 foot 2 at 13 ) , my mother advised me to act like I couldn ' t hear them . I would come up with insults and retorts and play them out in my head , but those insults never came out of my mouth . I censored myself , something Joan had the courage to never do . Humor is the best way to get your point across and nobody got their point across better than Joan .
