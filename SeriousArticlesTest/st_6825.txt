" We all love the films , but what ' s nice for me is that in the first movie we all became such good friends , " Berry said . " And we really like each other and we like being around each other so to have a chance to do the work and hang out with the people we really respect , admire and like to be around is the joy of coming back to do these movies . The beauty is we pick up as if we just saw each other yesterday . I was really happy to see everybody and meet the new cast . "
