That decline is the result of several factors , including ? OPEC production and U . S production , as well as the global economy and Iranian sanctions . Prices have continued to plummet to potentials as low as 20 a barrel , but OPEC has so far refused to cut production . And OPEC ? is not expected to reverse course unless other large producers also cut their own output . Resistance to cutting back may in part be a pushback against U . S . oil extraction , which increased nearly twofold in the past six years and has decreased the demand for foreign oil imports to the country . The global economic slowdown , led by China , has also lowered prices by decreasing demand globally . And ? Iran , which negotiated sanctions relief with the United States and others this year , is expected to begin pumping large amounts of oil into the global oil economy once its sanctions are lifted .
