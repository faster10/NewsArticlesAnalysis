There are a few things we can get out of the way about Tuesday s Republican presidential debate . First , after months of decline , Kentucky Sen . Rand Paul had his first great night , challenging Sen . Marco Rubio on tax expenditures and defense spending , pushing Donald Trump on the Trans Pacific Partnership , and stepping into his father s role as the libertarian gadfly in the race . If you re a profligate spender and you spend money in an unlimited fashion for the military , is that a conservative notion ? Paul asked in his closing statement . We have to be conservative with all spending , domestic spending and welfare spending . I m the only fiscal conservative on the stage .
