Sunday s NFC Championship was Carolina personified . It was loud and a little messy , big and bright ? exactly what the Panthers , behind their quarterback , have become this season . Love them or hate them , and few fall in between those extremes , Newton and company set the NFL standard , going 15 ? 1 with an average margin of victory of 12 points . When they roll into Santa Clara in two weeks to face the Broncos in Super Bowl 50 , they ll be favored , likely heavily , and the game will mark a transition . Win , and the NFL belongs to Newton . Beat Peyton Manning , and the generation shifts for good , and damn if Newton doesn t look the part of King of the World .
