I was there to visit old friends , partially reformed rabble rousers who once raised hell here but are raising a family now instead . They were running behind , so I decided to " flaneur " the 10 block walk to their house . I began at Seventh and Bedford Avenue , the gritty heart of the neighborhood , where the L train from Manhattan makes its first stop in Brooklyn . On some evenings , Bedford can feel like Bourbon Street for hipsters a corridor of beer breathed smokers moving from one bar to the next but it being early evening on a Sunday , the debauch o meter was dialed down .
