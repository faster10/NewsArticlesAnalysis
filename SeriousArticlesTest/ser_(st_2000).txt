After two straight road victories , the Patriots return home to Foxborough for a battle for first place in the A . F . C . East with an all too familiar foe : the Jets . On paper , this promises to be a matchup not unlike so many of the Patriots Jets games in recent years , centered on a stingy , rugged Jets defense taking on a high flying Patriots offense . Entering this game , the Patriots offense ranks as the N . F . L . s highest scoring unit , averaging 36 . 6 points per game . The Jets defense ranks as the league s best , giving up an average of only 15 points . Something , as they say , has to give . As always , it should be a blast to watch .
