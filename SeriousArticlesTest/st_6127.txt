I got up and fell again with a huge amount of debris falling on my body . I was scared but I got up again to move away from the house that I then saw collapse in a white cloud . With the few that were able to escape this tragedy , and also the friends of the football family , we started helping people trapped under the rubble . During the whole night , even in darkness and with their lives in danger , those young friends of football saved and removed a few injured colleagues under the rubble .
