Running is risky . Every year , there are serious injuries or even deaths among people who try to run with the bulls . In 2010 , I spoke with cancer survivor Michael Lenahan , who got gored in the leg by a bull his brother got hurt in the left buttock . In fact , between 200 and 300 people are injured annually , according to the Council of Pamplona . Proceed with extreme caution if you are planning on getting near the toros . There are so many people trying to watch and run that you might not know a bull is near you until its horn scrapes your arm .
