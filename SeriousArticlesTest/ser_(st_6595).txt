She was a perfect stand up comic . Self deprecating without being self deprecating . Her jokes were flawless . And she was always the smartest person in the room . Every time she came on TV , my mother would say , " You know she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard . . . Ivy League . " ( My mother was obsessed with Jewish celebrities , and Ivy League graduates ) . But the best part of Joan was how she made me laugh . And I mean belly laugh . And if you know a comic , you know that we don ' t laugh easily .
