A year ago , I had the opportunity to visit a museum of the Cultural Revolution in Guangdong province , one of only two such in the entire vastness of the country . It was an against the odds achievement that the museum could be built at all , but the price of building it was to tell the story in a way that focused almost exclusively on the victimization of some members of the Communist Party by other members . The authors of the museum bought the freedom to tell a portion of the story by suppressing all the rest .
