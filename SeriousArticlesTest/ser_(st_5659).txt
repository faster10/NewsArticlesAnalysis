The patterns for other drug use are similar to other surveys . Researchers have seen a decline over the past five years in use of prescription pain medicine and haven ' t seen an uptick in use of other drugs like heroin to compensate for the decline . The rate of abuse of the painkiller Vicodin , for instance , has dropped significantly from the peak abuse use five years ago , according to Volkow . It fell from 9 . 5 of those surveyed using it to 4 . 8 now . " This is quite significant because it is so addictive , " Volkow said .
