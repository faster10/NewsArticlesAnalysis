Trump , like some of America s less charming presidents ? Richard Nixon , Calvin Coolidge ? brings all of the bad to the narcissism game and little of the good , though Coolidge and Nixon were at least known for an intellectual nimbleness , and Coolidge was known for an extreme reserve , both of which Trump clearly lacks . Those very shortcomings , however , are a big part of Trump s success so far . He has always tried to appeal less to hope than to grievance , less to joy than to rage . That , history has shown , can indeed be a route to winning high office ? even if it s also a route to doing very bad things once you get there .
