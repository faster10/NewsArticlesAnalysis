Kunhardt : I was an art history major at Wheaton College in Norton , Massachusetts . I ' ve always been fascinated with our collection . I was flattered to be asked to help with this project , the Lincoln book . I ' ve been an intern since I was about in fifth grade . I ' ve grown up knowing this collection very well , putting everything in plastic sleeves . Then when we found out that they weren ' t of archival quality , I had to change them to polyester sleeves .
