Leguizamo : Get a recycled bicycle , recycle a bicycle , you know , something old and beat up . If you can ' t and you ' re too high maintenance , get something really fancy and wreck it . Get sandpaper and a screwdriver , and you got to mess it up . Because if it looks shiny and nice , no matter what massive lock you have , somebody ' s going to cut it . If you recycle a bicycle , you get the cheapest lock , and you don ' t have to carry that massive chain that will weigh you down .
