Come on . The problem revealed by Rubio s shady history with state party credit cards isn t that Rubio is bad at managing his finances ? it s that he s a weasel who cashed in on his position of ( limited ) authority . The image of Rubio as a poor money manager with massive debt isn t as damaging as his opponents and the press might think . Pretty much everyone in the country has trouble handling debt , and far too many people are carrying way too high a balance on their credit cards . Framing it in these terms just allows Rubio to make the point that he s not wealthy and he copes with the same financial difficulties as everyone else . The damning part of all this is that he abused resources made available to him as Speaker . I m not especially bothered that Rubio can t balance his checkbook , but I do care that he s a corruptible sneak .
