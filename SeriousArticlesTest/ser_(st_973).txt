According to ESPN , Jackson told the Browns that he would prefer to move on from the Manziel era if he did take the job ? something the organization said would not be a problem . Manziel caused trouble for Jackson s predecessor , Mike Pettine , after being drafted in the first round in 2014 . Despite some progress on the field from Manziel , Pettine demoted him after he had violated the team s trust by lying about the timing of a video that showed him partying in Austin during the bye week . The Browns must now decide whether to trade Manziel or cut him before the start of next season .
