The punting was excellent and Phil Dawson made his two field goal attempts , including one from 54 yards out . Without Dawson , the 49ers would be working on a long scoreless streak . Heck , Dawson even boomed a 48 yard punt against the Rams in this game . The return game was fine , but it doesn t help the offense no matter what happens on special teams . It would help if the 49ers could return a kick or a punt for a score once in awhile to fire up the team and perhaps jump start the offense , but you can t knock the group for doing its job .
