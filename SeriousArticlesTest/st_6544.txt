Thus ended a game in which no one could stop anyone and for long stretches it was a sight to behold , Brees ( 40 of 50 , career high 511 yards , NFL single game record tying seven TDs ) making it look so easy firing darts , making it impossible to at times discern which Giants defender was supposed to be where as the Saints ran free . Manning ( 30 of 41 , 350 yards ) wasn t far behind , throwing a career high six touchdown passes , his last two to Dwayne Harris as part of 21 straight points by the Giants to start the fourth quarter , a spree that turned a 42 28 deficit into a 49 42 lead when Rodgers Cromartie nailed Snead after a catch and cornerback Trumaine McBride picked the loose ball out of the air for a 63 yard fumble return with 7 : 11 left to play .
