Hoyer is 30 and just completed in seventh NFL season . He is what he is : a below average NFL starting quarterback . The problem for the Texans is that it will be hard to upgrade the position . Sure , there are free agents , but is Sam Bradford an upgrade over Hoyer ? Chase Daniel ? Drew Stanton ? Hey , Ryan Fitzpatrick will be out there . You could always take a shot on Brock Osweiler , but did he impress you when handed the keys to the Broncos ?
