It is hard not to like Ancelotti . Not many managers at his level would have the self depreciation to describe themselves as ' a fat boy with a bowful of Emilian tortellini . ' When Juventus fans compared him to a pig , he objected on the grounds that it was insulting to pigs . After all , he had grown up on a pig farm and food is the other great passion of his life . He once took David Beckham on a 100 mile round trip to Parma to ensure he tried a favourite restaurant .
