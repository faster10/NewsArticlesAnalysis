I do not see how the manner in which Mr Coleman was physically treated could possibly be acceptable , Emanuel said . While the Medical Examiner ruled that Mr Coleman died accidentally as a result of treatment he received in the hospital , it does not excuse the way he was treated when he was in custody . Something is wrong here ? either the actions of the officers who dragged Mr Coleman , or the policies of the department . In spite of the mayor s condemnation , police oversight officials last year ruled the officers actions with Coleman were justified . http : trib . in 1OMMjiE
