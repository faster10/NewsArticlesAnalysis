Blame golf ' s global game . There are so many good tournaments across the world that even a no cut event in a glorious location is not always enough to sway the big names . Ask Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson ( they skipped the tournament for years ) about that . McIlroy plays two tours and has typically started his year in the Middle East which is 15 times zones from Hawaii . Yes , McIlroy will get paid for just showing up in Abu Dhabi in two weeks and in Dubai two weeks later . But he spends nearly a month in the UAE , not only preparing for those tournaments , but for the year .
