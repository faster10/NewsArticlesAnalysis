The NFL changed the construction of its divisions in 2002 , which meant the Patriots and Colts no longer played each other twice a year . They were reunited in 2003 , a year that Peyton won co MVP of the league . While Manning put up big numbers in this one ( 4 TDs , 1 INT ) , he and the Colts were stuffed four times on the goal line in the closing seconds to lose a classic in the RCA Dome . Rookie Deion Branch caught the third touchdown pass of his career from Brady .
