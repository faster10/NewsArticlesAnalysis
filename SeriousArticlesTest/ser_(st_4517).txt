PHILADELPHIA ? Go ahead and get in your jokes . Express sympathy for the fall of a legend and a legendary franchise . Cry . Deny that it ' s happening . Turn away if you have to . Do whatever needs to be done to help you cope with this farewell season for Kobe Bryant . Because for as difficult as it has been to endure , for his devoted loyalists used to his previous standards and even for those who rooted for him to fail ( but not quite like this ) , don ' t think for a moment that it ' s going to keep Bryant from playing the game as he always has ? with blinders , without fear and without conscience .
