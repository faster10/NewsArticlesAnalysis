Green : I saw that Joss wrote that open letter . Let ' s be fair , all he really said was , " Hey , this isn ' t even 10 years old . " Are we really at the place where we ' re remaking " Two and a Half Men " ? Is that really still on the air , and we ' re remaking it ? And where is the need for that other than some kind of capitalizing on a trend . You know , there ' s no public outcry for a remake of Buffy , there ' s only the opportunity in pop culture where vampires are very popular .
