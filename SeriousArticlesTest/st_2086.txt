Jarad : Witten ? We know there is a lot to like about anyone going against the Chargers defense , but there is even more to like about Witten against the Dolphins on Sunday . First off , Romo is back . Second , the Dolphins have allowed 427 yards to opposing tight ends ( including 200 plus yards to Brent Celek and Zach Ertz last week ) in five games since their Week 5 bye . Witten is just nine receptions away from becoming just the 11th player to collect 1 , 000 receptions in his career . He should be targeted early and often as Romo looks for a familiar face .
