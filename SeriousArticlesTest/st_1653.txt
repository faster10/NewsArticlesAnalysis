When I talk to men and women in their 50s and 60s who ' ve decided to take on encore careers as teachers , they tell me that the work is often exhausting and stressful . They are on their feet all day , often with inadequate resources , with kids who are themselves highly stressed even those who come from leadership roles in other sectors say they ' ve never worked harder . Yet they almost always tell me that doing something that matters to others and that puts them in touch with young people every day compensates for the added stress .
