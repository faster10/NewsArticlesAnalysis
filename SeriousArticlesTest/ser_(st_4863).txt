Republicans and Democrats suffer from a common delusion that there is some magic lever that will make the economy grow if only we elect a president with the vision and iron determination to grab that sucker and pull really hard . This illness presents differently , depending on the patient . Democrats think the government needs to get right in there and micromanage our way back to 1950 , preferably Sweden in 1950 , while Republicans think that the road to prosperity is paved with low marginal tax rates . But no matter what the symptoms , it is still a sickness . Economic growth is mostly a matter of millions of individuals making decisions to save , invest and consume in new and better patterns and as amazing as this may sound , most of these people are thinking about things other than the government when they make those decisions .
