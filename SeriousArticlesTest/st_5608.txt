Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) is a common , harmless virus that stays dormant in healthy people for life but can cause hearing loss in newborns and babies who get infected in the womb . There s no cure for CMV , but drugs can help treat newborns and people with weak immune systems . The threat to the baby s health is highest when women develop an active infection during pregnancy and infects the baby in the womb . Infected babies often appear healthy at birth , but some develop hearing , vision loss or mental disabilities many months or years after birth .
