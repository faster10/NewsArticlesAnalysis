I too was a student at a school that believed adding the word " diversity " a couple of times to the university ' s admissions brochure would divert the attention of potential students away from the fact that less than 3 of the students were black . I too attended a school where an administrator ' s response to " why don ' t we attract more students like me ? " was " maybe they just don ' t belong here . " I too attended a school where at times I felt unsafe .
