Hard power in Yemen now lies in the hands of a divided collection of local and identity based armed groups with clashing agendas , who will demand to be taken seriously in the event of a new round of negotiations over Yemen s future . These groups have little trust in the ability of a centralized administration to act in their interests , and are hardly likely to easily submit to the will of a government in Sanaa or elsewhere . To insure their collective interests , they will want local autonomy at a minimum and , in the case of Hirak , outright secession from a 25 year old union with the north .
