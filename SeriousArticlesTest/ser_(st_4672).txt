Somalia ' s 3025 km coastline is the longest in Africa , and lies along busy shipping lanes that are crucial for the transport of goods from Asia to Europe , and of oil from the Gulf . It is estimated that between 20 and 30 , 000 ships pass through this area every year . For more than a decade , this environment has provided rich pickings for pirates launching small skiffs from Somalia ' s coast , hoping to hold up a ship with its cargo and crew until a ransom is paid by the ship ' s owner . In 2008 , piracy began to gain international attention as the number of attacks and the amount demanded in ransoms increased dramatically .
