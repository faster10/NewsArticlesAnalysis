The National Rifle Association has tried to blur the historical truth about the Second Amendment . In fact , at its headquarters in Washington , the words of the amendment are emblazoned right in front of the entrance . Oops ! They have emblazoned exactly half of this brief amendment , leaving off the embarrassing front part , about a " Well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a free State . " ( Notice also , the amendment says State , not Nation and these framers knew the difference , as it ' s a major difference noted elsewhere in the Bill of Rights . )
