This stuff wasn ' t predicted by any physics theory and was completely unknown until the Nobel prize winning teams of astronomers and physicists made their measurements yet there is more of it than anything else in the universe . More than the atoms that make up you and me and our Earth , more than the hydrogen and helium that pervades the universe , more than the unknown dark matter particles that cause attractive gravity and allow galaxies to form in the first place . Whatever it is , it ' s teaching us something utterly new about how matter and space and time behave . A fundamentally new physics theory is needed .
