The Warriors have made the season largely academic . The most popular question right now to argue about when it comes to the NBA ? " How do you stop the Warriors ? " I ' ve asked that question over and over again and eventually everyone comes to the same conclusion I have : You can ' t . The Spurs definitely have the best shot , but they don ' t play until January and even then there ' s a good chance the Spurs won ' t be full strength for that game . Even then , even if they " match up " does that mean winning four times out of seven ?
