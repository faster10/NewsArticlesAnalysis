Back in the 2008 Democratic primaries , Hollywood was solid Clinton country it only rallied to Obama after he snagged the nomination . After he won the White House , there were two years of mutual snub between L . A . and D . C . Not only did some moviemakers gripe that the President was a reluctant reformer ( remember Matt Damon or Robert Redford or remind yourself of when Obama was still anti gay marriage ) , but he rarely called people to say " thank you " for everything they ' ve done for him . Hollywood might tolerate inaction , but it can ' t abide the absence of flattery .
