This is the Year of Cam . Panthers quarterback Newton is the likely MVP , and though that vote likely won ' t be close , it might take a Super Bowl win to convince the public at large that Newton has truly arrived . The Panthers ' run to the No . 1 seed in the NFC this season was no fluke ? and it happened because of a powerful defense , with a breakout star cornerback in Josh Norman and the NFL ' s best young linebacker in Luke Kuechly . But it wouldn ' t have happened without Newton . He might not put up Brady like passing numbers , but his impact as a runner and passer makes him nearly impossible for defenses to stop . I think the Patriots will rebound from their late season slump to make another strong playoff push , bolstered by the expected return of Julian Edelman , but I think Newton will be an unstoppable force in Santa Clara , Calif .
