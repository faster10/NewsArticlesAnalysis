Arieff : The first time I was doing it all in hotels and it was very touristy and I loved it , but it was very touristy . This time I was really staying there for an extended period of time so it was nice to slow down in the crazy country and get to know it as someone staying for extended period of time . It gets under your skin because there ' s so much going on but people are so warm and everyone ' s not on their iPhone constantly . The tech industry is the south , Bangalore . In western India , where I was , it was slow and quiet . You hang out and talk and just enjoy being there and that brings you into that whole spiritual place . When I returned both times , people thought I was following a guru because they were not used to me being calm . I was happy to be in a slower paced setting with kind people . People ' s homes are more basic and it ' s more about family and religion .
