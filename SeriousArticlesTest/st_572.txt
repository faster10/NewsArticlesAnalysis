As before , I ' m going to split the horserace up into four groups , depending on what sort of chance they have of actually winning the Republican nomination , based on their nationwide polling averages ( all data from Real Clear Politics , I should mention ) . I should also mention that my previous column used data from October 19th , so when you see " since last time " below , that ' s what I ' m talking about . And , as before , I ' m going to present these groups in ascending order of possibility .
