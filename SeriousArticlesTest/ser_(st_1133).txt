Jackson ' s announcement came less than a week after EPA ordered BP to find another chemical dispersant to use on the oil spill after concerns arose about the long term effects of the substance now being used . Federal officials have been seeking an alternative to the hundreds of thousands of gallons of Corexit 9500 that have been sprayed on the oil slick since April . The product has been rated less effective and more toxic than many others on the list of 18 EPA approved dispersants , according to testimony at a congressional hearing Wednesday .
