This is Yost s sanctuary , amid the pines and the deer , and like the Royals , he s shaping it to fit his vision . He brings in a biologist each year to study and manipulate his property s deer population . He s putting in a 25 acre lake that should be finished sometime this season . He and his wife , Deborah , will build a house overlooking the water soon after that . They ll retire here someday . Maybe they ll grow alfalfa or some other crop that makes the farm self sufficient . Ned Yost likes a project .
