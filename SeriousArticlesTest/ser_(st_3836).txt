This matters , too , because of history . The last game the Bulls played was against the Cavaliers , a 94 ? 73 blowout loss , and calling their history against James checkered is a compliment . Since drafting Rose first overall in 08 , the Bulls have enjoyed a measure of regular season success against the Cavaliers star , going 17 ? 15 , including Tuesday . But in the playoffs , not so much . Since 2010 , James has faced Chicago in four postseason series , two with the Heat and two with the Cavaliers . He s won each , for a combined playoff record of 16 ? 5 against the Bulls .
