Postscript : I d love to know more about Bob Dole s take on Rubio . Let s not forget that in 2012 , Dole returned to Capitol Hill , pleading with Republican senators to ratify the U . N . Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities . Rubio ignored Dole s personal appeal and sided with far right extremists who oppose the treaty for the most ridiculous of reasons . ( Cruz was not yet a senator at the time , though we could probably guess how he would have voted . )
