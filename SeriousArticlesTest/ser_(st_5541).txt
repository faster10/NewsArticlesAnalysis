' After the Euros I got the feeling ( Gary ) Cahill was going to be the next focal point and it was an opportunity for someone to play alongside him . I felt it was mine to stake a claim but it was stop start at City . I ' ve only played three games this season ( so ) for me to say I should be back in the squad would be disrespectful . If I continue to play the same level up to the next international then hopefully I will be closer . '
