What this means is that states are free to say no to the Medicaid expansion . That will mean some big problems in implementing the Affordable Care Act . There are really no provisions for people making less than 100 of the poverty lines to receive subsidies to buy insurance on the exchanges . Many will not be penalized by the mandate because they make too little ( PDF ) , but that will still leave them without health insurance . In essence , without the Medicaid expansion , millions of the poorest among us will still be uninsured , with few options to rectify the situation .
