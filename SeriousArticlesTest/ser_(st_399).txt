The difficulty with India ' s strategic and political establishment is that everyone thinks he ' s Chanakya , though there is little evidence to bear out any such pretensions . Hence the very large volumes of political commentary and analysis of our current ' policy ' ( if constant flip flops can be described as such ) of continuing dialogue with Pakistan . Supporters of the government have been eloquent in their advocacy of the sheer brilliance of the establishment in increasingly focusing the Indo Pak dialogue on terrorism , and have projected the Pathankot attack as an ' opportunity ' to present damning evidence to Islamabad of its own malfeasance .
