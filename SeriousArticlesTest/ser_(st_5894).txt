TEMPLON : Yeah . For a few reasons , actually . One of the reasons is that it ' s difficult to prove match fixing . We have seen questionable trends , and obviously the bookmakers think that what ' s going on is very questionable for certain players . But we don ' t necessarily know that those 16 players or anyone else in our universe was definitively fixing the matches . And the other reason is that ours is more of a call to action for the tennis authorities . We feel like they are kind of ignoring the problem . And the scope and scale where we can say that there are these 16 that are repeatedly showing up that are , you know , high ranking players seems to make a stronger argument for that then just maybe naming one player .
