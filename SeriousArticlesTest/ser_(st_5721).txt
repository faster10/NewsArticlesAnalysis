When there is no accountability and seemingly no solution , then I once again must assume that either negligence or malice is involved . In the name of pacifying our streets , we hand over near absolute power to law enforcement while bingeing on true crime sagas behind our ever thicker walls . As long as we see these programs as simple entertainments and fodder for internet deep dives at 2am rather than sirens alerting us to the inequity of our world , there will be more Averys and Tamir Rices until on one cursed day , we can bear it no longer .
