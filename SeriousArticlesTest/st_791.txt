That burst of fireworks aside , however , it s hard to say this debate was anything other than substantive , with Clinton and Sanders clashing on real and serious ideological differences around everything from the role and influence of money in politics to the national security and foreign policy priorities of the next president . Yes , there were the typical questions about electability , and no , there weren t questions on reproductive health or climate change ? key interests for millions of Democratic voters . But on the main , anyone who watched the debate had a chance to see two politicians and public servants argue for their vision of the country and its future . This was a real contrast to the Republican debates , which tend to focus less on policy and more on dominance displays ( Trump versus Bush , for example ) and outright aggression ( Cruz on carpet bombing ) .
