Cosmo : If I knew that , I ' d be a really rich man . I have worked on lots of historical stuff , but I think " Game of Thrones " ticks so many boxes for so many people . And its production values are so high , continuously . It ' s just set a new standard for that sort of television . As far as identifying what it is , I think these shows come along once in a lifetime that people just embrace and it becomes something really special . The books that George Martin had written were so well loved by so many people , and ( show runners ) David Benioff and Dan Weiss brought that to the screen so beautifully .
