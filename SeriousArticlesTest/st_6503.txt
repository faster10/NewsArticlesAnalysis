New data were critical to the bizarre new picture . Adam Riess , using the Hubble Space Telescope to measure extremely distant supernovae , showed that earlier in the universe gravity was actually winning over dark energy that is , the initial big bang expansion of space was slowing down . Later , as galaxies moved farther apart , the attractive force of gravity between them weakened , and dark energy , which seems to be a constant property of space itself , took over . In today ' s universe , 13 . 7 billion years after the big bang , gravity is far weaker than dark energy . So Riess ' discovery clinched it : Alternative explanations for the original discovery would not have shown this evolution from gravity dominated to dark energy dominated space .
