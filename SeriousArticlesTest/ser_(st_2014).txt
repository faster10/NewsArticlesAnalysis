Another sensor embedded in the bridge looks like a big fork , said Phipps . This one constantly monitors for possible corrosion . Each prong in the fork is embedded at a different depth in the concrete . A power source sends electricity through the sensor . The amount of electricity passing through the sensor indicates the potential for corrosion on the bridge . Security sensors also have been built into the new bridge to guard against terrorist attacks . Infrared cameras and other technology monitor for unauthorized activity in sensitive areas of the structure , including doors to equipment chambers .
