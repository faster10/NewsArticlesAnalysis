Kill me , I hate this , this show sucks that ' s been Gervais ' s M . O . ever since he took NBC and the Hollywood Foreign Press ' s presumably lucrative offer to return to the job pretending that it ' s a lousy gig , that the Golden Globes ' tackiness and NBC ' s obsequiousness to celebrityhood is somehow beneath him ( beneath us all ) , and that it is , in short , an utter waste of three hours . He ' s not wrong about most of that .
