By now you ' ve either heard about or read George Will ' s controversial column on the issue of sexual assault on college campuses . Will ' s take is that the numbers are " preposterous " and using " simple arithmetic " he can prove the " supposed campus epidemic of rape " just ain ' t so . Worse , Will believes that progressivism , the Obama administration , a college hook up culture and shady math are turning survivors of sexual assault into a " coveted status that confers privilege . " He goes on to claim that efforts to address the issue on campuses is " making everyone hypersensitive , even delusional , about victimizations . "
