DAKOTA : I didn ' t go to the sex dungeon . I wanted to keep myself distanced from it at first because I wanted Ana ' s reaction to certain things to be completely honest and real , like new . But I did do a lot of reading about the culture of BDSM . It ' s about the ebb and flow of control between two people . To me , there ' s something really honest in wanting to completely give up control for just a second .
