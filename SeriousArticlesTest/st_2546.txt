Still , last season Bryant was bad . This season , he ' s managed to be even worse , mostly because it ' s improbable to be a guard at the age of 37 or older and have the proper leg strength and endurance to still make an impact . He ' s tried to make up for it with the simple math equation of taking more 3 pointers , but that just isn ' t working out . He ' s never been a great 3 point shooter , and now , with basically no legs under him ? Forget it .
