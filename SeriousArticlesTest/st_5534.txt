No man is an island , though , even if Curry s shooting evokes a man surrounded by water . This was another All Star performance by Green ( 22 points , 9 boards , 7 assists ) , augmented by excellent work off the bench by Festus Ezeli ( 12 points , 4 blocks , 20 in 20 minutes ) . Ezeli , who loves using his right hand , even tossed in a tough , lefty runner . This team will eventually lose ( probably ? maybe ? ) , but they re still finding ways to improve .
