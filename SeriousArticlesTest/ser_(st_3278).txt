When Nicholas shot himself in the head , he dragged Glenn into the horde with him and landed on top of Glenn . ? We never actually hear Glenn ' s screams of pain , we only see him screaming which could very easily be of fear of his own inevitable death . Now don ' t get me wrong , based on what happens and from all appearances , Glenn is indeed walker lunch . That was him being torn apart , not Nicholas , but there ' s something very odd about the whole thing and it actually has to do with the follow up show , Talking Dead .
