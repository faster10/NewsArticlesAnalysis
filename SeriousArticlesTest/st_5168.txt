The American people already know the truth President Obama will not utter , which is that the threat we face is radical Islamic terrorism , not random violence . The fact of the matter is that no Christian or Yazidi has systematically executed concert goers while shouting Allahu Akbar . Pretending all the refugees are equally likely or unlikely to commit terrorist acts prevents us from helping those we can while protecting ourselves from a real threat . And the insistence of the Obama Administration that the terrorist threat is not Islamic gives no confidence that any screening mechanism they would design would actually identify the radical Islamic terrorists whose stated goal is to murder Americans .
