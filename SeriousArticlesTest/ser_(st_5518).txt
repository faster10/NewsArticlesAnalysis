Biology provides some of the general primate psychology that we have , like pro social tendencies , sense of fairness , following rules . Our primate background provides that kind of thing , but the specific rules that our society adopts are not contained in biology , and sometimes people confuse that when I say that morality is contained in our biology , that every rule we follow has to come out of biology . I don ' t think it works that way . I think that we have general tendencies that come from our primate ancestors , and we turn that into our moral system that is suitable to our way of living .
