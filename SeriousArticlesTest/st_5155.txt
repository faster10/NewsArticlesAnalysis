' Jonny Sexton ( Ireland fly half ) calls me Mongo after the gingerbread man in Shrek , ' said Toner . ' I was 6ft by the time I was 11 and there have always been nicknames it was High Tower at college . But no one ever bullied me and I didn ' t bully anyone either , it was just one of those things . When you ' re around 13 or 14 there was that typical teenage awkwardness because you would stand out and be a bit self conscious , but you get used to it . I was fat as well one of my other nicknames was chunky ! '
