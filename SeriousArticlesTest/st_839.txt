Martin Scorsese ' s first foray into 3 D , " Hugo , " began its run in fifth place . The " adventure " ( read : homage to silent film ) cost producer GK Films a reported 170 million , and Paramount is distributing . " Hugo " earned 15 . 4 million in five days , and 11 . 4 million over the typical weekend . While those results sound alarmingly low , the silver lining here is that " Hugo " is only playing in 1 , 277 locations the smaller run yielded a strong 8 , 888 per theater average over three days . Still , " Hugo " has a LOT to prove before anyone should consider calling it a success .
