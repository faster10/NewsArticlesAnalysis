The number of Americans who still live in poverty today is far too high . We know the reasons for this are complex and range from the personal to the systemic . They are frustrating . But we can overcome them , one community at a time , by building coalitions , pooling resources , and sharing talents . This is the legacy of AmeriCorps VISTA : for every community that still struggles , I can show you one that is better off than when it started because of a VISTA member ' s service .
