" When we cast people we usually always try to cast single people , " he said . " And they ' d say they were single during the casting process . Then the moment they arrived at the house suddenly their ex was back in their life . I don ' t know if it ' s a safety blanket or that we ' re never really done with our exes . When you talk about the age of our cast , their ex is often their first love they play a huge role in their life . "
