Last month , actor Greg Grunberg ? who had a bit part in Star Wars : the Force Awakens ? told The Washington Post that Abrams regrets not directing Star Wars : Episode VIII after reading the script . However , Abrams clarified Grunberg ' s comments at the TCA panel Wednesday . " Here ' s the thing about Greg : You put a microphone in front of him , you never know what you ' re going to get . I love my friend Greg . He ' s my best friend since kindergarten . I think that my enthusiasm for VIII is enormous , " he said . " I think he also might have invented a couple of the quotes that he gave but I am very much excited for and very jealous of anyone , especially Rian , who gets to work so closely with this extraordinary cast and crew . Truly an amazing group , so in that regard , for sure . Honestly , I ' m also relieved to have gotten the chance to do a Star Wars movie . "
