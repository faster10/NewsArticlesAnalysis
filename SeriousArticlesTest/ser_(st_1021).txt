It raises an interesting legal and moral question , one any fan of the zombie genre has wondered about : If one of our citizens is living but fatally infected , and will harm others if allowed to live out their doomed life , does the state ' s broad authority include authority to terminate the infected ? At what point would we be comfortable with that ? In the zombie movies , it ' s a no brainer : generally , as soon as the group knows someone ' s infected , execution follows . And it ' s not always humane . Don ' t think we ' re above that in the real world . If the life of one threatens millions , does the state ' s police power authorize the pre emptive taking of that one life ?
