An ex Nirvana manager signed Stone Temple Pilots to Atlantic Records in 1992 . At first they sounded derivative but found massive success : Core came standard issue in college dorms in 1993 . But the band ' s sound shifted to bring in ' 60s and ' 70s influences . STP s first two records sold 14 million copies in the United States . After three more LPs , the band went on hiatus for a decade starting in 2001 . Eventually reunions happened but Weiland seemed to sabotage them with personal problems .
