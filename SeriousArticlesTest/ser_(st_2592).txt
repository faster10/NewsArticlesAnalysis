In that essence my heart bleeds for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks the same as it bleeds for the people of Palestine who lay in their own blood on a daily basis .

Where young boys and young girls are shot and killed on the city streets on a daily basis to the point that we are numb to the news of it .
