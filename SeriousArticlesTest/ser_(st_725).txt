Weiland will be busy anyhow , finishing that solo album , working on the four other acts signed to his imprint , Soft Drive Records , completing a memoir due out in the fall , and planning for a summer on the road with STP . As they gear up for the 65 date tour , which kicks off May 17 in Columbus , Ohio , the band is looking to fans to help determine the set list ? We re asking on our website what songs they want to hear , Weiland explains , and then we re also gonna play some nuggets , more obscure tracks ? and hopes to reenter the studio later this year to record their first original material since 2001 s Shangri La Dee Da .
