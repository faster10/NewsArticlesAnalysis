Never heard of the pangolin ? It ' s a rare , scale covered mammal . About the size of a house cat , the notoriously shy pangolin rolls up in a ball to protect itself , like a roly poly . It can fend off lions in this manner , but not poachers . They just pluck these critters out of the jungle and toss them into sacks . Pangolin meat and scales are quite valuable on the black market . So much so that the pangolin is thought to be the most trafficked mammal in the world . If any creature needs the publicity a " day " can provide , it ' s the pangolin .
