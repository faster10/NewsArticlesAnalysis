Palmer seemed to get going on the next drive , piloting the Cards near midfield before Arizona was forced to punt again . But that only set up an even more explosive Panthers score . With 1 : 03 left to go in the first quarter , Newton dropped back on third and 8 from his own 14 , surveyed the field and rifled a deep pass near midfield to receiver Philly Brown , who broke past safety Rashad Johnson and into the end zone for an 86 yard score and a 17 0 edge .
