It occurred in the third quarter of New England s ? 20 13 win over the Buffalo Bills in Foxboro . As the Buffalo defense brought pressure on Tom Brady , he rolled to his right and went looking for Danny Amendola . The quarterback lofted a pass to his receiver before stepping out of bounds , and Amendola had nothing but clear space in front of him when he hauled in the reception . He likely could have found the end zone , but that s when that pesky inadvertent whistle came into play .
