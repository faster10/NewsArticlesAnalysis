It was Jimmy Carter who invented the significance of the Iowa caucuses . In 1975 , the Georgia governor had a one percent name recognition outside his state . But instead of bowing to New Hampshire ' s similarly arbitrary first primary in the nation status , Carter practically lived in Iowa , sleeping on supporters ' couches , carrying his own garment bag and engineering a showing good enough to get him national attention . Even though he came in second in the 1980 caucuses , behind Uncommitted , he still beat nationally known Democrats like senators Birch Bayh , Fred Harris , Mo Udall and Scoop Jackson , which won him a media narrative ( " Jimmy who ? " won Iowa ! ) and a launch pad to win New Hampshire a month later .
