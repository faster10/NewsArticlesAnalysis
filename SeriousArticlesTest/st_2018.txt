Nixon , Reagan , Bush I , and Bush II used the military to accomplish political objectives . They weren ' t focused on keeping American safe . It ' s no wonder that Bush II launched a poorly thought out war in Iraq and as a consequence destabilized the Middle East , creating ISIS and the current chaos . Nixon , Reagan , Bush I and Bush II did not govern by a strategic plan but rather a set of ad hoc tactics intended to improve their short term political futures . These Republicans didn ' t keep us safe .
