I know road teams are all the craze this weekend in the NFL playoffs , but Washington has some serious mojo going for itself at home in FedEx Field this season . If you throw out that lousy Week 1 performance in a loss to Joe Philbin s Dolphins ? that s how long ago that was ? Washington is 6 ? 1 at home since opening day , and quarterback Kirk Cousins has been on fire in Landover . Cousins has thrown 15 touchdowns with zero interceptions and a gaudy 123 . 7 passer rating in those seven games , and he s in a comfort zone all his own after emerging as the most consistent quarterback in the NFC East this season .
