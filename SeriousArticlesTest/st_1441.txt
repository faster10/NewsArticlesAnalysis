Sure the show revisits these moments in flashbacks , but viewers " don ' t want to derail the storyline in the current time to keep going back , " Nemetz said . " People have been burned with shows like ' Lost ' and ' Heroes . ' They get invested in them , and seasons later they still don ' t have answers to the questions they tuned in for , so they get a little disillusioned and give up . That might be happening earlier than usual ( with ' Revolution ' ) . "
