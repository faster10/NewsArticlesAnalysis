You can ' t write about the drinking water debacle in Flint , Michigan , without first recognizing the depth of the tragedy . For more than a year , an entire city was exposed to the risk of lead poisoning . Of the people we already know have been poisoned , more than half are children under the age of six . Those children will suffer neurological damage for the rest of their lives . Long after you and I are gone , some of them will still be living a life diminished . No matter what happens now , that cannot be undone . No overdue apology , no grudging mea culpa , no release of emails , and no state of emergency declaration can undo that damage . Take a moment and imagine how you ' d react if you were that child ' s mother or father .
