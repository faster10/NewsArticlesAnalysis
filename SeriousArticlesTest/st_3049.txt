It was the second week of the Open and Connors was playing at old Louis Armstrong Stadium , and tennis was making a sound for him I d never heard it make for anybody .

He eventually lost to Jim Courier in the semifinals . Does it change what we saw across those two weeks and what Connors had done in his career , and not just at the Open ? Come on .
