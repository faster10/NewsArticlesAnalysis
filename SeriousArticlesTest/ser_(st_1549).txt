Two blockbuster sequels rounded out the top five . The Hunger Games : Catching Fire dropped 50 percent in its fourth weekend to 13 . 2 million , giving it a scorching 357 million total and all against a sensible ( for a movie of this scale ) 130 million budget . It took the first Hunger Games five weeks to reach the same total on the way to a 408 million domestic finish , so Catching Fire still seems poised to break the 400 million mark . One rung lower , Thor : The Dark World grossed 2 . 7 million in its sixth frame and has now amassed 198 . 1 million . It will eke past the 200 million mark soon , and while that ' s no gross to shake a hammer at , it ' s slightly disappointing considering the original Thor earned 181 million and Disney was no doubt hoping for more than an 11 percent boost following The Avengers ' run especially given the fact that Iron Man 3 earned 31 percent more than Iron Man 2 ( 409 million vs . 312 million ) earlier this year .
