Even in this cynical age , you re allowed to be excited . It might not be very on brand behaviour for the loftily principled , but LCD Soundsystem don t need to play live again , by reasonable accounts , for the money . They don t need to correct past legacy wrongs and come back bigger than ever . They seem to be doing it for the biggest , vombucket rock cliche of all : the chance to do what they love and if anyone else likes it , it s a bonus . Bonkers , truly .
