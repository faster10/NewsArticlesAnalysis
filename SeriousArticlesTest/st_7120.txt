THE DECIDING PLAY : Once the Redskins had tied the game , Cowboys return man Lucky Whitehead made what ended up being one of the most critical plays of the game when he ran the ball to his own 44 . Thanks to this field position , Dallas only needed 20 more yards to put kicker Dan Bailey in range . And with 9 seconds left , he knocked down a game winning 54 yard field goal to give the Cowboys a much needed 19 16 victory , their first this season without Tony Romo in the lineup .
