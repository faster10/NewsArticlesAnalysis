If the answer is yes and this is by far the No . 1 way Americans get health insurance go on about your business . Obamacare doesn ' t really affect you . At least not yet . A lot of people think that because of Obamacare , fewer companies will offer health insurance , particularly to low paid workers and retirees . There is some evidence of this . These employers would have to pay a per worker fine to the government , but it might be cheaper for them in the long run to pay this fine to the government rather than offer insurance . Other companies might cut hours for some workers , making them part timers working fewer than 30 hours a week in order to avoid helping pay their health insurance . But it will take some years to see if it really comes to pass . However , if you get health insurance at work , you could probably drop that coverage and buy health insurance on the Obamacare exchanges . But you might not want to . You won ' t qualify for any government help to buy your insurance and your employer wouldn ' t be contributing any of the money it is now .
