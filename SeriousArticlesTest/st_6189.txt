Keenan is a hard man . He has returned four times to Lebanon ? on his own ? since he was released by his hooded kidnappers , to discover what he calls the stories lying about on the streets of Beirut if you just pick them up . It s a phrase used by the Lebanese writer Elias Khoury , who insisted that there was more than just one narrative ? the Israeli story ? about the Middle East , and it led Keenan to return to those who were behind his kidnapping . To understand all this , he thought , was the debt Lebanon owed me .
