Smith : I ' ll make it as painless as I can : a six month run that culminates with a one night performance we broadcast into movie theaters like we did with " Live From Behind " a few months back . So ultimately , anyone who can ' t make it to Broadway to see the show can go to the movie theater the night we stream the production and see if for like 20 bucks . The hardest part for me won ' t be making it happen the hardest part at this point , for me , will be standing on a stage for two hours and not talking .
