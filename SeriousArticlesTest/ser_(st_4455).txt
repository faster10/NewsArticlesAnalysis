The recent case of the radicalisation of the San Bernardino shooter Tashfeen Malik is just the tip of the iceberg . Founded by the ultra conservative Farhat Hashmi , the school system where Malik was radicalised is known for radical conservative teachings and has worldwide presence . Arif Jamal told me , The al Huda school system is closely allied and linked with a Pakistan based Salafist jihadist group called the Tehreekul Mujahideen , which is waging jihad in Kashmir . Tehreekul Mujahideen is the armed wing of the Jamiat Ahle Hadith of Pakistan , which is hugely funded by Saudi Arabia .
