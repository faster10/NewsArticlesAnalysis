We were taken back to those dismal days in recent weeks when a rocket launched by the privately owned ( but government contracted ) Orbital Sciences Corp . with cargo for the International Space Station exploded in midair shortly after lifting off from Wallops Island , Virginia . Three days later , SpaceShipTwo , built by Virgin Galactic ( private , not taxpayer , dollars in this case ) as a working prototype for a passenger spacecraft , broke up during a flight test over California ' s Mojave Desert and crashed , killing its co pilot and seriously injuring its pilot .
