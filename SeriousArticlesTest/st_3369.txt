Peter Head : Well , there are a lot of problems associated with this . I mean , a lot of people are now aware of climate change and the issues of emissions into the atmosphere . But of course we also got the problem of food supply , we got the problems of resource management of all kinds and therefore each of those has slightly different parameters as to whether it ' s too late or not . Overall , my view is that it ' s not too late if we make changes really quickly .
