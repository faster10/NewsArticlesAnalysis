Is Mr Gandhi breaking away from his Youth Congress idealism and siding with controversial yet famous politicians for temporary gains ? The U . P . elections will provide an answer . If he abandons his call for meritocracy and his promise of unity over division , it will be hard for young Congress workers to accept that merit alone cannot be the measure of political success . They still look up to him with unstinting belief that one day he ll tow the party away from the influence of nepotistic politics . Prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections , Mr Gandhi struggled to drum up support his call for opening and democratising his ranks could not resonate with the people as the Congress reeled under the outbreak of three high profile scams . Since the Congress is out of power , he now has enough space to mobilise support with his narrative of democratising the Congress , promoting young leaders and weeding out parochial attitudes .
