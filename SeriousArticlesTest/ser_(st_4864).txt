This means that adding an extra tenth of a percent onto the growth rate through policy is really hard . Nearly doubling the growth rate which is what Bush is proposing to do is basically impossible unless the baseline government policy is really bad . Of course there are many , many government policies that could be better ( indeed , practically all of them ) . But we are not wheezing under Venezuelan style corruption and mismanagement . Growth is tepid because our workforce is aging and productivity growth is sort of slow , not because millions of would be entrepreneurs are cowering under their beds in fear of the tax man . Whatever supply side benefits tax cuts will unleash will not be enough to let you run a government of the size that Americans demand on tax rates of the size that Carson is promising .
