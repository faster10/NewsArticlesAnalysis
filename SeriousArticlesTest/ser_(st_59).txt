In Week 13 , the Eagles made the decision to utilize Darren Sproles as the lead back on offense . He finished with 19 total touches and 100 yards rushing and receiving . He added another 83 yards on a punt return touchdown to bring his total to 183 . The 32 year old veteran is just as explosive and elusive as he ' s ever been , and the Eagles ' offense operates well when he is involved in the offense . With Ryan Mathews ( concussion ) set to return , and DeMarco Murray hoping to reclaim a big share of the offensive snaps , it would be too easy for Sproles to fade into the background again . That would be a major mistake .
