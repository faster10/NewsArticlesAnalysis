In a memo sent Tuesday to employees , Johns noted that a legal filing in July had been interpreted by some to mean that the utility " was leaving the door open to somehow blame San Bruno residents or the city of San Bruno for the accident itself . Nothing could be further from the truth , which we stated at the time . In a follow up filing , we clarified our position by explicitly stating that none of the plaintiffs or residents of San Bruno was at fault for the accident . PG E has consistently stated our position that we would do what we could to assist the residents of San Bruno and help them recover from this tragic accident . "
