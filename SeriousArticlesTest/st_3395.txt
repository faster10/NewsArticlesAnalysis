Having Mindy is very fun ! When I first got Mindy it was pretty hard because she didn ' t listen to me , but now she does and she knows a lot of commands . I ' ve even taught her some new things , like climbing up into the fort section of my swing set . The best thing about having Mindy is playing with her and I love racing with her . If she is on her leash she runs right next to me but I know she can run really fast .
