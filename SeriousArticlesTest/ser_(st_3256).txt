Fortunately , for me , I was born into a middle class family . Our life was filled with tensions most Americans know too well : saving our home from foreclosure , keeping the lights on and worrying whether my dad ' s small business would survive tough times . But unlike the children flooding into our country we felt safe from hunger , from violence , from fear of losing our lives at any moment . Like most Americans , we found comfort and complacency in that degree of safety .
