This is not a battle of ideas it s an investment in cynicism . And it ' s hard to avoid a few ugly conclusions . Clinton has not learned from the mistakes of 2008 . She does not understand the Democratic Party ' s base . She does not respect the activists and intellectuals who have fought to establish the party ' s economic policy agenda over the past 50 years . And she thinks voters in early primary states are dumb enough to fall for obvious dishonesty , just because they already like her .
