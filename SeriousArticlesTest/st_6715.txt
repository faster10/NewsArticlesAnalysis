Fortunately , the British public are beginning to recognise that Trump isn t a laughing matter , but a dangerous one . A petition to ban Trump from entering the UK has reached 200 , 000 signatures , which means parliament will have to consider the motion for debate . The Home Office has the power to ban speakers from overseas coming to the UK under the unacceptable behaviours or extremism exclusion policy , and if Trump s views were to be deemed as deplorable as those such as the Westboro Baptist Church and Ku Klux Klan officials then he too could be banned .
