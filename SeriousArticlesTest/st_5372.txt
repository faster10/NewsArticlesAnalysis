In theory , there are other policy advantages to an oil tax . Some advocates have suggested using it to replace all of the various fuel excise taxes the government currently collects . That would both simplify the IRS ' s job and perhaps help the public forget about the tax altogether . It would also act as a de facto carbon tax that would , again , reach beyond gasoline , and would encourage some amount of conservation . And though Obama doesn ' t seem to be going this route , the government could also tax a percentage of each barrel ' s cost rather than collecting a set fee , so that if the price of oil went up , Washington would get more revenue ( of course , if the price went down , it would ? collect less ) .
