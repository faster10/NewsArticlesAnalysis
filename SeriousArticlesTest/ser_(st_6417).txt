While finishing unbeaten in the regular season is nice , Iowa is the least threatening team in the playoff picture . The Hawkeyes ' best win might be their last one , which was against an unranked Nebraska team , though they do have a win over No . 14 Northwestern as well . The Hawkeyes aren t in the top 10 nationally in points per game or points allowed per game . Their passing game isn t explosive ( ninth in the Big Ten in completions of 20 plus yards ) , and while they lead their conference in interceptions ( 17 ) , they re in the middle of the pack in sacks ( 27 ) .
