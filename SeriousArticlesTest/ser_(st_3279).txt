It seems incredibly odd that they wouldn ' t do an extended memorium for such a loved character . They did one for Dale in Season 2 and he was not a likable character . They did one for Merle in Season 3 , and he was a complete asshat who needed to die . They did one for the Governor in Season 4 , and they even did one for Gareth and the rest of the Termites in Season 5 . Hell they did one for the turtle in the second episode . Yet Glenn gets one sentence . To me that seems very odd .
