Weinfuss : I don t get the sense they think the Panthers are the easier matchup . Rather , I think they looked at playing the Seahawks as an opportunity to get even with a team that embarrassed them a few weeks ago . The Cardinals are obviously more familiar with the Seahawks , playing them twice per season , so I think that also had a lot to do with their comments . The Cardinals haven t faced the Panthers since last season ' s playoffs . We all know how that game turned out , but both teams were quite different then . From talking to the Cardinals , they know the Panthers present a unique set of challenges , especially with Newton behind center .
