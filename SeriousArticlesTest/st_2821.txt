The plausibility arguments against Sanders have been losing their steam for months , and they re getting less plausible by the day . Still , though , Clinton is well positioned beyond Iowa and New Hampshire . She leads comfortably in the next two primary states , South Carolina and Nevada , and , as Chris Cillizza pointed out , she is in great shape because the rest of the calendar is made up of much more racially diverse states ? Nevada on Feb . 20 , South Carolina on Feb . 27 and so on and so forth ? where Clinton runs far better than Sanders .
