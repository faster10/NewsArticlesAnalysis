Romney ' s broader appeal was buried beneath a wave of scandal and political character assassination . It was the debates that allowed him to regain control of the narrative . In that first debate he was clever , funny , energetic and passionate and in many ways outclassed Obama . My theory is that Romney flourished because the format was like a corporate job interview : question after question , a little light sparring , an emphasis upon " pep " ( " Gee , I ' d just love to run your country . When can I start ? ! " ) . The inner intern shone through and Romney behaved like a smart kid out of college who ' s hungry to get his foot on the corporate ladder .
