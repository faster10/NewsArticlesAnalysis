In addition to some of the more colorful prop bets highlighted above , there are in game bets for seemingly every statistic and scenario . When it comes to prop bet strategy , the temptation is to spread your bets across a variety of outcomes . However , Campbell advises against that approach : " My biggest suggestion is just to make sure your props line up with whatever side or total you take because you are likely to just end up hedging yourself if you don ' t . If you like the ' over ' for example , it ' s pretty logical that Cam Newton would have a big game to make that happen so your prop picks should reflect that . Try to avoid having your props contradict your side or total plays on the game . You ' re probably just going to end up with your Super Bowl as a wash that way . "
