Golden State was just 6 of 10 from beyond the arc in the first half . That ' s a great percentage , obviously , but the six makes isn ' t crazy , nor is the 10 attemps . San Antonio was actually forcing the Warriors off the line . The problem was in the paint and at the rim , where the Warriors were 16 of 24 . Yes , 24 of their 41 first half shots came near or at the rim . They were getting there at will , largely because San Anrtonio was so worried about closing our hard , but on the back end the Spurs ' rim protection was non existent . LaMarcus Aldridge ( who we ' ll get to in a second ) was exploited consistently , either being brought out in space to be shook or just generally being caught slow footed and off guard .
