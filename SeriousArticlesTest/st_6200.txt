I still personally wouldn t breastfeed at a restaurant with a bunch of people I didn t know staring at me , revealed Kim . I ve seen this before and remember tweeting how shocked I was . Now that I m a mom , I m not that shocked , especially if you have a few kids and can t leave to breastfeed one kid in the bathroom while leaving the others at the table . But I still personally wouldn t do it , unless it was an emergency situation and I was fully covered .
