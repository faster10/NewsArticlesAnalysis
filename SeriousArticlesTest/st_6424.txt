Through faith , I will continue choosing not to be crippled by the weight of the dismay , trauma , and disbelief associated with this , and I will be steadfast in my determination to overcome the barriers of this injustice . My strength , focus and vision come both from the Lord and from the solidarity and outreach of so many good folks on both sides of the border and around the world . I am not journeying alone as I have poured out my broken heart to so many . And it feels as if they symbolically cupped my tears and replenish me continuously with flowing waters of hope and support .
