What everyone wants , of course , is " full employment . " That ' s a term economists don ' t like much because while it describes a simple idea ( everyone who wants a job has one ) , the details are squishy . For starters , " full employment " does not and will never mean 0 unemployment . People are always changing jobs , looking for new positions , or taking breaks , so some percentage of the population is expected to be out of work at any given time .
