CBO expects the shift will also affect the federal budget . Government revenue should rise because money that goes to employer health coverage is exempt from taxes and now , thanks to the agreement , more of that money will remain as regular wages , which are taxed . Government spending will also rise , because , again , a small portion of the people not enrolling in employer plans will now go to Medicaid or the subsidized marketplaces , where they ll receive some form of financial assistance from the government .
