Looking back , it still hurts to know how much time I missed with my daughter . I missed her first steps . I missed her first words . I missed so much . And it took years until I could let that all go , until I felt like her mom again . I ' m finally realizing how hard it must have been on my husband . He was no longer able to hold her . To help her . To play with her . He had to watch from the sidelines while everyone else took care of his child .
