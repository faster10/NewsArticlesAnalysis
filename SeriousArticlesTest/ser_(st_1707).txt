Abrams said he had learned to create a sense of stillness and patience from the impressionistic Malick . There were many scenes where I might have typically wanted to rush the camera around or cut more frequently . But in trying to grow a little bit , and in trying to tell the most powerful story possible , you learn lessons in restraint , you learn lessons in stillness , you learn lessons in confidence and trust in your characters and the audience . And so I found myself working to not just keep things moving as fast as I could , which sometimes has been my default . But rather sometimes to keep things as still as I could , or let things breathe , as a balance to the action , of which there is much in the movie .
