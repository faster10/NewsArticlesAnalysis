Tamang ' s house was one of the bigger ones in this region , a rare two story structure . She and her husband built it together , a lifetime ago . He died years ago , but her extended family lived here with her until Saturday . She , along with her daughter in law were indoors when the quake struck , and she was lucky to make it out onto a small wooden balcony . Another tremor brought this down and she had to extricate herself from the rubble and crawl up an embankment . The younger woman , trapped in the wreckage after the roof fell in on her , eventually clawed her way out .
