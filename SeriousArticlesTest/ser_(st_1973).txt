His closest competition had a bad night : ? The man who s his closest competition in Iowa , Ted Cruz , had maybe his worst debate performance of the cycle . And a lot of it was due to the fact that he ? not Trump ? was the candidate with the target on his back . Marco Rubio went after Cruz , hard . So did Rand Paul . But it was Cruz who also did himself no favors by trying to win an interruption contest with co moderator Chris Wallace ( and lost ) and who attacked the moderators questions like he did at the CNBC debate ( but was booed in the process ) . Cruz got his taste of being the front runner , and he struggled . The Des Moines Register s front page ? sums it up : Rough Night for Cruz .
