It was sometime between 3 : 30 and 4 : 30 in the morning in McLean , Virginia , when Erik Prince got the call . In Moyock , North Carolina , Gary Jackson had gotten word of the attack as well . Jackson headed into his office at the Blackwater training facility , where he was joined by Chris Taylor , who had just been promoted to vice president of strategic initiatives , and Mike Rush , the director of Blackwater Security Consulting . They linked up with Prince by phone , as he arrived at his unmarked office in a McLean high rise in the dark hours of morning . The details were still sketchy , but they knew that four of their own had been killed .
