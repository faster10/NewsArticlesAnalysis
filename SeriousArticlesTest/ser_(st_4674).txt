However , action taken by international governments seeking to protect their trade interests and to maintain security along Africa ' s east coast has led to a decline in successful pirate attacks . In 2011 , there were 28 hijackings , 20 lower than the 2010 figure . In the first 11 months of 2012 , Somali pirates only managed 13 successful hijackings . There has not only been a reduction in successful hijackings , but also in the number of attempts that pirates are making . While in 2011 , there were 199 incidents in the high risk area off Somalia ' s coast , by the end of 2012 this figure had dropped by almost two thirds .
