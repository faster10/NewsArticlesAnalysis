? ? Super Tuesday will be March 1 in Texas and 13 other states ( plus American Samoa ) , followed by some big contests in mid March . Kansans caucus on March 5 Missouri s primary is March 15 . Each might prove consequential in a minor way because not even Trump will have amassed enough delegates yet to assure a convention majority . The march to Cleveland in July ( and a majority of 1 , 237 delegates ) continues throughout April , May and early June . Enjoy !
