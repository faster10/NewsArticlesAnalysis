But this 2015 Charlie Brown feels safer and sappier than he ' s been in the past . Maybe it has to do with how often he smiles , or how his poignant philosophizing has been replaced by madcap dance sequences meant to showcase an original Meghan Trainor pop ditty . Two characters crucial to the Peanuts world , Lucy and Linus , have muted personalities , studio execs perhaps terrified of the former ' s caustic domineering nature and the latter ' s penchant for quoting Scripture . And there ' s definitely something off about the chipper ending , which milks a small internal victory to coddle Charlie Brown in a way that ? well , that robs him of his tragic status . Is a little low self esteem no longer appropriate for G rated audiences ?
