When my son was sleeping , I was checking the text messages and followed the Instagram updates after all , this wasn ' t really sneaking if my son maintained a public profile . But what could I say ? Should I tell him that I am monitoring his moves ? Was my looking at text messages the same as reading a diary ? Was I violating my son ' s privacy and simply making too much of this ? My husband told me to back off , that our son was merely a kid with a crush who needed to experience this rite of passage on his own , without a hovering mother . But I wasn ' t so sure .
