The Fall Classic starts Tuesday ( the entire playoff schedule was predetermined ) in an American League ballpark , thanks to Mike Trout and the rest of the AL All Stars , which included seven Royals and three Blue Jays . The Dodgers Greinke and Kershaw allowed a total of three runs in the 6 3 loss . The Mets Jacob deGrom did his part , striking out the side on 10 pitches in his inning of work . Regardless of the matchup , the Mets will have the pitching edge in perhaps every game . However , the Royals were there last year and don t strike out a lot . Toronto s offense can explode for a crooked inning at any time . The Royals would be a contrast in styles since Ned Yost can t wait to turn the ball over to his bullpen , while Terry Collins knows his best chance is sticking with his starter as long as possible before giving the ball to his closer . The Royals and Mets open the 2016 season against each other in Kansas City . No matter what , this will be the first ever all expansion team World Series . The first World Series was played in 1903 , and every one since has included one of the 16 original franchise . This one won t though , as the Mets arrived in 1962 , while the Royals ( 1969 ) and Blue Jays ( 1977 ) came later .
