What else is going on in the world of politics ? Well , Michael Bloomberg seems to be jealous of Donald Trump , so he hinted that maybe America would thrill to see two New York City billionaires in the presidential race . Bloomberg seems to have deluded himself into believing that there is an enormous yearning for a pro gun control , pro stop and frisk candidate out there , and apparently all his closest buddies agreed . If Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic nomination , Bloomberg ( so far ) says he won ' t run , but if it ' s Bernie Sanders versus Trump or Cruz then Bloomberg says he ' ll just have to jump in to save America . So there ' s that to look forward to , we suppose .
