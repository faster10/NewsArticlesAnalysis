It is well known that Belgium supplies by far the most foreign fighters to Syria compared to other EU countries in per capita terms and that Molenbeek is where they are concentrated . Jan Jambon , the interior minister and a Flemish nationalist , said that of 130 foreign fighters who were known to have come home from Syria , 85 were living in the small Brussels borough of Molenbeek just west of the city centre . He demanded that the local authorities conduct a door by door vetting of who was living in every house and flat in the borough .
