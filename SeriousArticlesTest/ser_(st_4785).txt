Dear Kindergarten Parents and Guardians , We hope this letter serves to help you better understand how the demands of the 21st century are changing schools , and , more specifically , to clarify , misperceptions about the Kindergarten show . It is most important to keep in mind is sic that this issue is not unique to Elwood . Although the movement toward more rigorous learning standards has been in the national news for more than a decade , the changing face of education is beginning to feel unsettling for some people . What and how we teach is changing to meet the demands of a changing world . The reason for eliminating the Kindergarten show is simple . We are responsible for preparing children for college and career with valuable lifelong skills and know that we can best do that by having them become strong readers , writers , coworkers and problem solvers . Please do not fault us for making professional decisions that we know will never be able to please everyone . But know that we are making these decisions with the interests of all children in mind . Sincerely , Ellen Best LaimitAngela CasanoKeri ColmoneStefanie GallagherMartha DeMartini
