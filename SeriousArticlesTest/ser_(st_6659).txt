Gupta : It is an awful feeling . It is paralyzing , really , for me . I go to New York a lot , and the ride from La Guardia to Time Warner Center . . . it ' s a quick ride . And I need to be ready to go when I get there . If I ' m having a bad ride , I am pretty much incapacitated for a good half an hour , 40 minutes after I get there . And it is all those things : I get sweaty , I feel really sick to my stomach , I feel like I ' m going to throw up , I can ' t think straight , I can ' t even talk on the phone at that time because any kind of stimulus just really throws me off .
