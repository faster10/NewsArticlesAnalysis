' I sat on the chair with her during the Maureen Connolly ( under 18 ) Trophy last year when we played against the United States at New Haven . She beat the No 1 and 2 for the States and came from a set down in both of them . She was able to process the tactics and information and stick with them against girls who were a couple of years older than her and very much more experienced . That was when I realised , we ' ve got a player on our hands here . '
