Texas and other courts permit an individual to challenge his or her isolation or quarantine by a petition for a " writ of habeas corpus , " asking a court to declare that the quarantine law is unconstitutional or violates due process . Courts will defer to the state ' s police power and public health decisions unless they are " arbitrary , oppressive and unreasonable . " That doesn ' t mean it ' s without precedent : if the state cannot show good enough reason , some courts have struck down a quarantine .
