It was in the backdrop of all this that a think tank on national IPR policy was set up by the central government last year . The think tank was seen as a move to placate America , European and others which have been unhappy with India s drug patent regime . Though the think tank was couched in broader framework of the need for a national IPR policy , it was clear that its real agenda was to review drug patent related issues . The final report of this group has been recently submitted to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion , but leaked versions of this report indicate that fears about the real intentions behind this exercise may after all be true . We are yet to hear an unequivocal statement from the government that any review of the patent regime would necessarily be done only to protect public health and patient interest . Such an assurance should have come at the time of setting up of the think tank itself . ?
