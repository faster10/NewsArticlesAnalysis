' We seem to have a good new wave of English golfers and it ' s funny how it seems to happen in cycles . You ' ve got the likes of Luke and Westy ( Lee Westwood ) , Justin Rose and Ian Poulter , who were all about the same age and now you ' ve got the likes of myself and Tommy ( Fleetwood ) , Sully Andy Sullivan and a few others . So hopefully I can be the leader . We ' re all aiming high and let ' s hope we can go on to match the last wave . '
