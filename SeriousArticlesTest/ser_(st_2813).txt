One last note : If you or a loved one has a urinary catheter in the hospital , be extra vigilant they can become breeding grounds for bacteria . First , ask if one is truly necessary . " If the patient is awake and oriented and alert and can use a bedpan , it may not be needed , " says Dr John Jernigan , a medical epidemiologist at the CDC . If you get one , make sure it comes out ASAP , since the longer it ' s in , the riskier it becomes .
