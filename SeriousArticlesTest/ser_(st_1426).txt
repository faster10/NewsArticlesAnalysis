The idea of sustainable development is that an economy must satisfy all three principles : economic growth , social fairness and environmental sustainability . Yes , there can and should be economic growth , especially for today ' s developing countries . Human ingenuity and markets can indeed lead us to higher living standards and longer lives for all parts of the world , rich and poor alike . But these gains should be widely shared and should never be based on the exploitation of those at the bottom of society . Social inclusion has been widely shown to improve societal progress broadly for all . And equally important , those gains should be based on true value added , not on the destruction of natural capital , whether through deforestation , climate change , or pollution of air , land , and water .
