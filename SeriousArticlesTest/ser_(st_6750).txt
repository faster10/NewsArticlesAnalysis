The decision against Stutzman sets a dreadful precedent against our first freedom in the Bill of Rights : religious liberty . The court says that she is free to believe what she wants , but not to practice her religious beliefs . The court has ruled that if she wants to run a business in the state of Washington , she must defy her conscience and participate in same sex weddings . If she does not , then the full coercive power of the state as well as civil liability will be brought against her .
