Lock said : " When ZANU PF was in power , you had hawks and doves in government and the doves were approachable and often helped us . But now that these positions are being shared with Mr Tsvangirai ' s MDC , Mr Mugabe has only appointed hawks to his cabinet who insist on continuing the land reform program . And when it comes to the MDC , the land issue seems to be a hot potato they do not want to touch . I have asked Mr Tsvangirai to intervene but nothing is happening . "
