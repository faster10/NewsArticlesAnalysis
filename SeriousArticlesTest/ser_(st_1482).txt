' But I have no complaints . I haven ' t absolutely volleyed the lad . I have tried to trip him up and he got further away from me and that is why my leg is straighter than it should have been . I have apologised to the lads . I think everyone knew ( I was in the wrong ) . I am just grateful they were able to hold on . It ' s always tough against 11 men when you are a man down , especially when they are throwing a lot of balls into the box , so I am grateful that we held out . '
