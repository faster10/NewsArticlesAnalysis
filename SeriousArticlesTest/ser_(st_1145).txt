" I said numerous times that I pray to have a stage that people will listen . I pray to God I do right by my influence , " Newton said . " So when you ask me a question about African American or being black and mobile , it s bigger than that . When I go places and I talk to kids and I talk to parents and I talk to athletes all over , they look at my story and they see a person ? African American or not ? they see something they can relate to .
