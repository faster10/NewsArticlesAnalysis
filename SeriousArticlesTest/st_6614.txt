The group ' s self production has gained bounce since 2004 ' s To the 5 Boroughs . They get guest shots from Nas ( " Too Many Rappers " ) and Santigold ( the reggae detour " Don ' t Play No Game That I Can ' t Win " ) . The music is full of signature touches , from the punk drum solo in " Lee Majors Come Again " to the low end electro funk of " Here ' s a Little Something for Ya . " MCA sounds as gruff as ever in " Nonstop Disco Powerpack , " giving it up to hip hop pioneers like Rammellzee and K Rob ' s " Beat Bop , " Afrika Bambaataa and Spoonie Gee ( " The one MC who you can ' t deny " ) , while both the bass line and the distortion filter vocals echo Spoonie ' s 1980 classic " Spoonin Rap .
