Another unquantifiable variable that has hit the BJP hard is the statement of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat favouring review of the OBC ? ? ? s reservation . In the assessment of the Grand Alliance strategists , the statement gave them the opportunity to project the BJP as a pro upper caste party that opposes reservation . It took the BJP quite a while to realize the damage caused by the statement and bring in correctives . On the other hand , Nitih Kumar led alliance lost no time in spreading the word that the BJP was averse to OBC ? ? ? s entitlement in government jobs . In a society where government jobs are the signs of upward social and economic mobility , the disinformation about the BJP caused serious damage . The extent of it would be clear on November 8 when the poll results are announced .
