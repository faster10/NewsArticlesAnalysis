There is a chance FanDuel can still succeed , but that chance is substantially less than it was before , Nellie Drew , a sports law professor at the University of Buffalo , said in an email . The injunction doesn t mean it is over for FanDuel , but it certainly bodes very well for the Attorney General . I would say , more likely than not , that unless there is something in FanDuel s and DraftKing s arsensal that we have yet to see , they have a big worry .
