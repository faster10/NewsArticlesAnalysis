Patton writes about how freshman women should be " a little nicer " to senior men , as though women never date men younger than themselves in college , and therefore , there are fewer to choose from as each new class graduates . As a freshman , I barely even knew any seniors . I ' ve heard I seemed " nervous " and " spazzy " in my first year . I lived in fear of sounding stupid , getting subpar grades and locking myself into a major I didn ' t like . I was probably less emotionally prepared to have a serious relationship than at any other time in my college career .
