3 . Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz cruise . The two candidates rising fastest prior the debate continued their steady upward trajectory on Tuesday night . Despite a pre debate report in the New York Times that Jeb Bush s super PAC planned a multi million blitz against Rubio , few of the candidates ( with the exception of Paul ) tried to lay a glove on the Florida Senator , who had a steady if not exceptional night . Cruz , if anything , was more on point , hammering relentlessly away with base tickling attacks on the D . C . media and big government cartels . I understand when the mainstream media covers immigration , it often doesn t see it as an economic issue , said Cruz ? defending Trump s positions on the issue . I would say the politics of it would be very , very , different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande ? or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press .
