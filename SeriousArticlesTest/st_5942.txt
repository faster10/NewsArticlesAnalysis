And yet , I think Making a ? Murderer does not quite hold up to the same pressure that Serial and The Jinx were eventually subject to . Serial was created by the same team behind ? long running public radio standby This American Life , and was hosted by journalist Sarah Koenig . A significant feature of the podcast is that Koenig s narrative style includes self questioning and reflection , tempered by humor ( Sometimes , I think Dana isn t listening to me ) . Plus , in the latter half of season one , Koenig directly addresses issues that the audience brings to her attention , like the racial component of the friendship between Adnan Syed and Jay Wilds . It s not perfect , and Serial was the subject of much discussion , but it was difficult to fault Koenig s dedicated investigation , even if you did not agree with her conclusions . The Jinx , meanwhile , was almost the opposite it was a highly personal and particularly artful docuseries ? one that very well might not have existed in the form it did if the producers hadn t stumbled into Durst s ramblings on a live microphone after his final interview with Andrew Jarecki . What it has in common with Serial is that strong central narrator , in the form of Jarecki , as primary interrogator Jarecki s conversations with Durst are the equivalent of Koenig s phone calls with Syed ? intimate , unstable and rife with dramatic tension . One gets the sense in both Serial and The Jinx that the truth led the fact finders into unexpected directions ? whether that is the envelope reading Beverley Hills or Syed telling Koenig , I mean , you don t really know me .
