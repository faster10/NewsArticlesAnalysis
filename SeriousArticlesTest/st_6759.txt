Trump s candidacy , it has exposed not just that tragic , the ramifications of that betrayal of the transformation of our country , but too , he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle that has enabled it , okay ? Well , Trump , what he s been able to do , which is really ticking people off , which I m glad about , he s going rogue left and right , man , that s why he s doing so well . He s been able to tear the veil off this idea of the system . The way that the system really works , and please hear me on this , I want you guys to understand more and more how the system , the establishment , works , and has gotten us into the troubles that we are in in America . The permanent political class has been doing the bidding of their campaign donor class , and that s why you see that the borders are kept open . For them , for their cheap labor that they want to come in . That s why they ve been bloating budgets . It s for crony capitalists to be able suck off of them . It s why we see these lousy trade deals that gut our industry for special interests elsewhere . We need someone new , who has the power , and is in the position to bust up that establishment , to make things great again . It s part of the problem .
