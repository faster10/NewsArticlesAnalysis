Still , the Patriots have shown some vulnerability ? the last two weeks . Brady was nearly picked off in the closing stages of Week 11 s 27 26 victory over the New York Giants , and New England required a 54 yard boot from kicker Stephen Gostkowski with one second remaining . Fast forward to Monday night against AFC East rival Buffalo , Brady took a beating and didn t lead a touchdown drive until the final seconds of the second half . Brady was sacked just once by the Bills , but took another 10 hits in the pocket .
