Rachel Nichols : We ' ve seen enormous change in the last five years , and we ' ll see enormous change continue . I think the overall question is going to be : Is there a point where the information fans are hearing about what happens to these players from playing the game of football , the more stories we see , the more heavy hits there are , at some point does that diminish the ability to enjoy the game as you ' re watching it ? What we have started to see is more and more parents who are saying to their kids , " You know what ? I don ' t think I want my kid playing football . " That ' s going to have a significant impact . Baseball used to be the national pastime . We have seen the NFL overtake that . There ' s no question that our most popular sport is football . That doesn ' t mean it ' s always gonna be football .
