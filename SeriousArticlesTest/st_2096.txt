After the difficulties of the last six months , I just want to stay healthy and play week in , week out . If I can stay injury free , I believe I ' ll do well and my team will do well . My future is a little bit cloudy and I may have to go back to Norwich . But it ' s not in my hands , let ' s wait and see . Stay at Watford ? Why not . I am enjoying my football here and why would I want to leave when I ' m having fun ?
