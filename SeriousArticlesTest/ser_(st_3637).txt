I will be able to see that triage tag on Monday , when collection donors are invited to visit the museum before it opens to the public on Wednesday . Museum officials tell me it ' s one of several survivor artifacts and is displayed alongside a written portion of my story . I am not sure what my reaction will be in encountering this section of the exhibition , but no matter what , I ' ll be feeling a deep sense of kinship with all the other survivors in the room . We lived through an experience that bonds us forever .
