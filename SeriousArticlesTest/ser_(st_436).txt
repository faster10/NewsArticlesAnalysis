If Paltrow ' s cameo is ? slightly awkward , it ? at least shows that Martin has made ? peace as he moves into the next stage of his life . It ' s a point he drives home in the album ' s more overwrought second half through songs such as Amazing Day , ? Up Up ? and Army of One , which brim with as many positive platitudes as their titles suggest ( although Army ' s hip hop leanings make it Dreams ' most curiously enjoyable oddity ) .
