Second , the recent red carpet treatment of China ' s likely new president , Xi , in the U . S . and the absence of any major agreements shows that the future of U . S . China relations will be difficult . Whether it is the economy ( demands for China to act as a stakeholder in global economic recovery and trade fairly ) , security ( demands for transparency on its military buildup ) , global affairs ( complaints about China ' s veto of a U . N . resolution on Syria ) , or society ( demands for better human rights in China ) , the U . S . list of complaints about China is long . Beijing is concerned that the new U . S . " pivot " to Asia is window dressing for an effort to contain China . And the Chinese government is worried about pathological U . S . overspending ( with skyrocketing debts borrowed from the Chinese ) . Though they don ' t say it in polite company , Beijing ' s leaders see U . S . complaints as those of a declining power , looking to block China ' s rise rather than finding ways to solve its own internal problems .
