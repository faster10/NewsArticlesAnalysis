We must build this broad coalition that I have mentioned to hit terrorism , Hollande said at the start of talks with Putin at the Kremlin on Thursday . I am in Moscow with you to see how we can act together , to see how we can coordinate to hit this terrorist group and at the same time find a political solution for Syria . Putin said that Russia has also suffered from terrorism and understands France s experience . All of this is forcing us to combine efforts against a common enemy . We are prepared for this cooperation , Mr President .
