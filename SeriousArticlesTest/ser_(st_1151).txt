Before that third quarter , there wasn ' t much notable happening . Klay Thompson had scored 18 points in the first half , and the Warriors had gotten away with playing a frontline of James Michael McAdoo and Marreese Speights for awhile . Charlotte had gotten to the free throw line a ton , and the Warriors had not . Then Curry did what Curry does , completely bending the game to his will . There is nothing in the NBA like it , and there is no one in the NBA like him .
