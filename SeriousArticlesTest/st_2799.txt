NBA defenses thumb their nose at players who try to take over by themselves . It s a strategy from a bygone era that doesn t breed team success . You simply aren t going to be allowed that many field goal attempts unless you can make a good chunk of them . Still convinced this record will someday be broken ? Only 77 players in NBA history ( not including Bryant ) have even attempted 14 , 151 field goals . In other words , Kobe s missed more shots than Tony Parker s tried to make ! Brain : fried .
