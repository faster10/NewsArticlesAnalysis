As Facebook s popularity ( and revenue ) has exploded , we ve watched Zuckerberg mature into a thoughtful leader in business and philanthropy . He and Chan made the largest public charitable gift of 2013 , when they gave 18 million Facebook shares valued at 990 million to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation . In 2014 , they donated 25 million to fight Ebola in West Africa . Zuckerberg has also signed the Giving Pledge , a campaign launched by Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett to encourage the world s uber rich to give more than half their wealth to charity . ( Today ' s 99 percent announcement puts that figure to shame . )
