Pressed by King about whether he is going to shut down Globovision , Chavez answered , " I do not know . It depends on them . If they keep on sponsoring coup d ' etats , if they keep on calling for my assassination , if they keep on breaching the law even as well , it is not Chavez that ' s going to close them . I want to apply the law . We need to respect the law . It is the law . It ' s out of logic , and it ' s pure logic . "
