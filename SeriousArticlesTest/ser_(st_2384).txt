As chronicled by Nate Silver , Mitt Romney now has a big lead in Republican Party endorsements , giving him a huge advantage moving forward . Through the end of November , Romney had 55 of all Republican endorsements and his share has only increased in December and after his slim victory over Santorum in Iowa . The only other person with a non trivial number of endorsements is Texas Gov . Rick Perry . Consequently , Perry remains the only candidate who could somewhat plausibly challenge Romney in a drawn out fight for the nomination .
