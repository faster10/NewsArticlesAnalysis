Here ' s what he means : Clicking Pinterest ' s " Pin It " button , which can be added to your browser ' s bookmarks toolbar , will automatically grab the picture you want from the website you are on . What is different is that it immediately adds it to any of your Pinterest boards , allowing you to categorize your content then and there . The boards each have a separate page and can be easily accessed , shared and viewed on a sort of mother board on your Pinterest profile .
