' People used to say I wasn ' t mean enough and I would just roll with the punches , ' said Toner . ' I was always the BFG as a teenager . I wasn ' t someone to throw my weight around . It ' s not like I ' ve suddenly developed a mean streak , but I ' ve had to work on that ability to physically dominate my opponent . I ' ve had my fair share of critics and I ' ve had to develop that edge . You leave the nice guy approach behind when you get on the pitch . '
