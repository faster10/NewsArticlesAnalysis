Grammer : There ' s so many twists and turns on plot points that can ' t be revealed , but what I can tell you the first half of the season is a series of manifestations of his disease and the decisions he ' s making are maybe colored by it . A bit more rash than he ' s been previously . So what we have is an accelerated , rhythmic shift in the energy of the show . I think some will find welcome , but also confusing in a weird way . It all changes again in the middle of the season , where we shift him back in a more slightly evil way and what his choices are for the next season , if we have one .
