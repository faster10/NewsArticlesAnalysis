Nor does Little Big Town ' s win as vocal group of the year rankle me , even though I picked the Zac Brown Band to win that one . I admit that ' s partly because I have a real affection for Karen Fairchild , Jimi Westbrook , Kimberly Schlapman and especially Phillip Sweet . I spent a day with them at the 2011 WGAR Country Jam , and Phillip ' s daughter , Penelopi , then a couple of months shy of her fourth birthday , was kind enough to show her Barbies to " Mr Chuck . ' ' That kind of thing sticks with a fella .
