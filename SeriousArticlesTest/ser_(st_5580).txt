I think Edelman coming back , Danny Amendola healthier and Rob Gronkowski with a few weeks to rest that knee ? that helps the offense and the offensive line especially , just letting Brady get the ball out quickly , former Patriots offensive lineman Dan Koppen told 98 . 5 The Sports Hub s Toucher Rich on Tuesday . ? He ll be able to find his guys underneath and over the middle . Those quick passes , yards after catch , moving the chains and getting the guys on defense tired , that s what this offense is all about . That s the best case scenario : Those guys coming back and really going into what they did for the first 11 weeks .
