As people , we have a giant talent for forgetting . 9 11 was the game changer for our world . We haven t forgotten it but we don t remember it either . We don t revisit those feelings of animal dismay that we all feel in the presence of death . It s simply not nice to dwell . That is entirely , gloriously , human . But it can lead us to forget what our world has become and why . Rote remembrance of facts doesn t always help explain our new politics of primal emotion . Nor the festival of violence and death that realpolitik has become .
