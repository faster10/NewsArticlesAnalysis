Even if the contract is signed today , the initial aircraft could come only by 2019 . The IAF risks a capability gap with China without these aircrafts . China has over double the number of combat aircraft than India and the gap is widening . Even if all 126 Rafale aircrafts were to be procured , the IAF would reach the sanctioned squadron strength earliest by 2025 . At 33 Squadrons , IAF s edge over Pakistan Air Force has reduced to a low of 1 . 5 : 1 . The MiG 21s can t be extended at the cost of safety . Both the FGFA with Russians and DRDO s LCA are behind schedule . The closer to specifications LCA 2 will not come till 2022 . The buildup of India s military strength has not kept pace with the increasing threat . Of India s defence requirements , 70 is through imports , 25 with the Defense PSUs and the remaining 5 with private partners . For India to become a global power , indigenous defence manufacturing would have to be strengthened . Rafale could be the one to make this beginning .
