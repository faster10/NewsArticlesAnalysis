But none of this makes sense . Yes , British exporters will have to abide by EU rules if they want to export to the EU . But this is also true of American exporters , and Chinese exporters , and Russian exporters . It ' s basically unknowable whether the U . K . would have more clout in trade deals inside or outside the EU , since it ' s not like the nation runs the EU ' s trade negotiation process as it is it is one voice among 27 . Arguably the country might even have more clout , since the way it basically works now is that EU bureaucrats run the show and nations have no say .
