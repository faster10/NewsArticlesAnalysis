Pelecanos : Last week , I watched three extraordinary genre movies from , respectively , Japan , South Korea and Hong Kong : " 13 Assassins , " also " The Man from Nowhere " and " Ip Man . " The last 45 minutes of " 13 Assassins , " directed by Takashi Miike , is one of the most stunning extended action sequences ever filmed . Recently , I re read my John Steinbeck library and was reminded that " The Red Pony " is one deep , dark book . Thurston Moore ' s new one , " Demolished Thoughts " is a beautiful , dreamlike record . D . C . has seen a reggae and funk resurgence of late . In that vein , I recommend See I ' s debut and the compilation " The New Gold Standard 2 " by Fort Knox Five .
