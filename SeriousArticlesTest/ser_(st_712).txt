Many Miami restaurants boast they serve the freshest fish in town , but few have their own fishing fleet to back up the claim . Garcia ' s Seafood Grille and Fish Market ( 398 N . W . N . River Drive , Miami ) offers its own freshly caught fish and a great view from a deck overlooking the Miami River . It ' s a trick to get there , and the restaurant is one of the few bright spots in a still run down area of downtown Miami , so go with good directions . As you lunch on a mahi mahi sandwich with a beer served in an ice cold mug and watch the boats go by , the trip to Garcia ' s will seem well worth the effort .
