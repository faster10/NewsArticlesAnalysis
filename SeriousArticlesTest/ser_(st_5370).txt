Think of this as an increase in the gas tax , but with slightly broader reach , and perhaps slightly better political optics . Any fee imposed on oil companies would likely be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices , so motorists , airline passengers , trucking companies , and the like would eventually end up paying much of the bill ( transportation is responsible for about 70 percent of U . S . oil use ) . The cost of other petroleum products , like plastics , would also rise a bit . As the White House clarified on a call with reporters , the fee would apply to imported oil , but not to exports from the U . S . , so American drilled crude wouldn ' t be at a disadvantage on the global markets .
