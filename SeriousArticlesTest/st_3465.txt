I guess this is supposed to be kinda like the Ice Bucket Challenge ? A group calling itself Pump It for Pangolins is encouraging Facebook users to post videos of themselves doing 21 crunches in honor of World Pangolin Day . You can share videos on the group ' s Facebook page or by tagging it pumpit4pangolins . The goal is to raise money for pangolin conservation . I think the crunches are supposed to simulate the way the pangolin rolls up in a ball when it feels threatened . But these odd videos remind me of the way a pangolin in Vietnam ab crushed my arm when a researcher asked me to hold the animal .
