If this doesn t happen , we have to consider what other options we have , he said . Mr Seehofer is a member of the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) party , which is closely allied to Merkel s Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) . Mr Seehofer also criticised Austria for failing to co ordinate the flow of migrants into southern Germany . German police said they had picked up more than 11 , 000 people at the Austrian border on Monday alone . This behaviour from Austria is harming neighbourly relations . You cannot and may not behave like this with each other , said Mr Seehofer .
