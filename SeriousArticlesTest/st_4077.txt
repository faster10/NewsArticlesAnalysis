USC holds the nation s No . 11 recruiting class and No . 2 group in the Pac 12 , but things got off to a rocky start immediately following the dismissal of Steve Sarkisian earlier this fall . USC lost a commitment from its top prospect , outside linebacker Mique Juarez , and another ESPN 300 linebacker , Daelin Hayes who had signed early enrollment financial aid paperwork left the class as well . Since then , things have remained steady , though many recruits took visits and were exploring other options . With USC playing in the Pac 12 championship game this Saturday , Trojans coaches won t be able to hit the recruiting trail quite as hard as other programs taking advantage of the start of the contact period , but it wouldn t be surprising to see an uptick in prospects picking up interest in USC or setting future official visits now that Helton has been named head coach .
