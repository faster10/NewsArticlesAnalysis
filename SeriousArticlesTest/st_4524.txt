Bryant ' s motivation is a little simpler nowadays ? trying to finish in a respectable fashion , finding a way to avoid getting stiff as the game progresses and embracing every moment he has left in his storied career . He doesn ' t plan to take many more nights off . ( " I ' m , what , going to save it for pickup basketball at Equinox ? God willing , I ' m healthy and I can walk and run , then my butt will be out there . " ) He isn ' t sure how he ' ll handle making his final stops to other memorable places , such as Boston or San Antonio . ( " For once in my career , I ' m going to refrain from being a control freak and just take it in . " ) And he won ' t get caught up in storybook endings . ( " You kind of live in the moment and allow life to happen . " )
