The researchers behind the new paper propose a number of geochemical steps shown above that could have seen hydrogen cyanide start a series of reactions that led to the creation of amino acids , nucleic acids and lipids necessary for life . First the hydrogen cyanide is dissoved in water ( a ) and then reacts with metals to create salts ( b ) . These are left behind by evaporation and then undergo changes due to geothermal heating ( c ) . The resulting molecules are swept away by steams and accumulate in ponds where they react further ( d ) .
