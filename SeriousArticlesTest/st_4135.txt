But who today would care ( or dare ) to make a case for exceptional Irish criminality ? The immigrating Irish were more prone to criminality not because of some genetic inheritance , but because they were so very poor , so neglected , so abandoned . When I see a vagrant today , snoring on a park bench , clothed in rags and stinking , I think to myself : Whatever happened to this guy , whatever the history that dropped him on this park bench , no one loved him enough when he was a child .
