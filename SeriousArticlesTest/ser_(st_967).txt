As part of Swinney s 3 . 3 million compensation package in 2015 , Clemson paid him 500 , 000 for the rights to market his name , image , and likeness . Thanks to the trademarks , other parties that sell Swinney trade marked products must pay 10 of wholesale price to Swinney for using his name ( Dabo Swinney or just Dabo ) , and 10 to Swinney for using BYOG or Bring Your Own Guts . So Swinney makes 20 on items that include both . The Collegiate Licensing Company , which helps manage the relationships between s Swinney s representatives and outside vendors , has given permission to 13 companies , including Nike , to sell merchandise ? mostly apparel ? stamped with the BYOG slogan or Swinney s name or both .
