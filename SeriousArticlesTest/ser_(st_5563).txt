Abdelhamid Abaaoud , Belgian , 28 , grew up in the Molenbeek district of Brussels , but vanished in 2013 and showed up in Syria . His father Omar has accused him of kidnapping his younger brother Younes who at the age of 13 was vaunted as becoming the youngest foreign fighter in Syria . He was jailed for robbery in 2010 and spent time alongside Salah Abdeslam . His possible presence in the Saint Denis flat was part of the reason for the Nov . 18 police assault . Up until Wednesday Nov . 18 , Abaaoud was believed to be in Syria . CCTV coverage showed him in the Paris metro underground rail network near the place where one car used in the attacks was found , according to a police source . The news prompted media speculation that he too may have taken part directly in the Nov . 13 attacks , and not just organized them .
