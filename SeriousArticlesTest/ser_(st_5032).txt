I felt great going into the season , but also knew that I would need to re assess things at some point , Pinkel said in the statement , and I set our bye week as the time when I would take stock of the future . After we played Vanderbilt on Oct . 24 , I had a scheduled PET scan on Oct . 26 ? for reassessment , and then visited with my family and came to the decision on Oct . 27 ? that this would be my last year coaching .
