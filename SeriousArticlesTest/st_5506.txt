Officially I m under strict orders to defer that question until tomorrow from the Hall . Trust me , I ll be a good soldier and we ll make it official tomorrow . In light of what you said , I think the Mets have such a unique fanbase , not only in the city but across the country . It s just something I can t describe . It s a mixture of love and frustration and ups and downs . The emotions are very strong . It s one of those things , as a visiting player , I knew coming to New York , it wasn t a comfortable place to play .
