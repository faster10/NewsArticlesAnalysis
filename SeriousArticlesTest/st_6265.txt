Pack like you ' re making lasagna ( no , seriously ! ) You probably don ' t want a security official inspecting your carry on bag by hand . Time consuming inspections usually only happen when an X ray machine operator can ' t identify items . Avoid this hassle by packing in a way that keeps your curling iron , hair dryer , and other hard plastic or dense items separate in your bag , instead of allowing them to get tangled in a pile and look suspiciously like a bomb or a weapon on an X ray scan .
