I think on this team anybody can score the ball , guard Jimmy Butler said . So on any given night , a guy can take more shots than another guy , just depending on who is making more shots . I think that s OK . I don t think offense has been our problem . I think it s been on the defensive end or it s coming out sluggish , coming out with no energy . The offense is always going to be there because we get so much freedom . The defense and making sure we re ready to play every night is the thing we ve got to make sure we bring .
