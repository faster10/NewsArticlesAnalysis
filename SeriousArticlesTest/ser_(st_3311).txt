' The New Rochelle football program is a very strong program , and once you ' re a member of that program , you ' re a member of that program for life , ' Lou DiRienzo said , according to The Journal News . ' Ray is a part of our family and a part of this program , and that ' s why I ' m very happy that he ' s here today . He made a mistake and he made a very terrible mistake but I know the character of the man , and he will rise from this . '
