IAF had projected a requirement of 126 aircrafts way back in 2001 to replace strike aircrafts like the MiG 27 and Jaguar , which were to retire by 2015 2020 . The MMRCA was to fill the gap between India s Light Combat Aircraft and the in service Sukhoi Su 30MKI air superiority fighter . Rafale is an agile aircraft and capable of simultaneously packaging air superiority , interdiction , reconnaissance and airborne nuclear deterrent missions . Rafale also features an advanced avionics suite including active electronically scanned array ( AESA ) radar . The French government has reportedly cleared full technology transfer with Rafale , including the AESA . Rafale has seen combat in Afghanistan , Libya and Mali . The aircraft will bring new levels of technology and would help India dominate the Indian Ocean region . India would also be discussing Air Independent Propulsion system for submarines , building additional French Scorpene submarines at Mazgaon Docks and a possible point defence missile system .
