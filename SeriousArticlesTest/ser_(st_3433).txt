Ironically , asking Gates and Zuckerberg to try to fix the problems of climate change , income inequality , wealth redistribution , and the failing welfare state only confirms this thesis . The futility of public works has become so ingrained as an idea that the return to a Cold War ? era public private partnership ? the kind of partnership that drove the creation of the free , public , unified Internet rather than the fractured landscape of cloistered social media sites we have today ? never even enters our minds . Even Bernie Sanders suggestions for free college are far less radical than the postwar GI Bill and other programs designed to fight the Soviets . ( This was a time , remember , when the CIA was funding abstract expressionism as a means to fight communism . ) American s commitment to making smarter Americans was one of the best things to come out of the Cold War ( even if it brought with it xenophobia and nuclear terror ) , and for a time it was a reasonably successful effort . Gates has tried to do the same and is beginning to find that the education system is far too broken for one person , or even one education reform movement , to fix . As Massing notes , for example , Gates has backed off of demands for teacher assessment based on test scores in the face of its utter failure as a metric .
