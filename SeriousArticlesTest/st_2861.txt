My " routine " outpatient surgery ( which was on my butt get all your sophomoric jokes out of the way now ) went awry and I was in terrible , excruciating pain . To help , my doctors who were absolutely fantastic , created a sinister cocktail of pain medications so strong that it ' s usually reserved only for Hollywood starlets . It included morphine , Percocet , Toradol , some sort of synthetic morphine derivative on a pump , and my personal favorite Fentanyl , which my doctor told me is an opiate 80 times more powerful than morphine .
