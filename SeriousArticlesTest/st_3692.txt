S . officials are hoping the expanded participant list at this week s upcoming talks in Vienna will help get things moving on resolving the long running Syria conflict . And to that end , they are trying to leave differences , as much as possible , at the door . The Washington Post reports that Secretary of State John F . Kerry is trying to focus on points where the United States , Russia , Iran and other participants agree on what an endgame in Syria should look like and what it will take to get there . And until they can build some momentum , they re trying not to let points of intense disagreement , like Assad s role in a post conflict Syria and how Russia is conducting its current bombing campaign , throw everything off the rails again .
