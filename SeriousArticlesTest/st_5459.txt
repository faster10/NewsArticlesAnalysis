Why take unnecessary risks if the 49ers can play it safe and make sure the loss looks semi decent , while the Yorks rake in the cash from Levi s Stadium ? Why not employ a non threatening coach like ( Jim ) Tomsula , who makes the owner and general manager feel comfortable , instead of combustible Jim Harbaugh , who gave them the willies ? Why pay Colin Kaepernick if you can survive with ( Blaine ) Gabbert at 20 percent of the price ? Why go for it on fourth down , trailing your bitter rival by 16 points in the final minutes , when you can punt two more times and make sure the Seahawks can t score a bunch more points ? Yes , Sunday s defeat dropped the 49ers to 3 7 , pushed their road record to 0 5 , and summed up so much about the current state of this muddled franchise .
