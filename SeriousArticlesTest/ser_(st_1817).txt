It s a very different approach than the one Clinton took on the road in the final days of Iowa , where her argument was about which candidate had more rational , achievable plans , not headier ideals . It seems to me it s a lot easier to get from 90 percent to 100 percent than to get from zero to 100 percent , she said often of her plans to build on Obamacare , compared to Sanders dream of trying to institute a new system of universal healthcare for all .
