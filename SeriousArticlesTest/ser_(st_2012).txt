There is an opportunity before Pakistan to join the global war against terrorism to regain its bruised image . India is not the only country which views its estranged neighbour with suspicion . The list is endless . Pakistan has been ticked off by major powers from time to time . It should listen to the sage counsel and launch a war against terrorism .

It is up to Pakistan to decide which path it wants to tread . Talks with India can wait .
