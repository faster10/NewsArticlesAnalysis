( On how good it will be to get Thomas Rawls back next season : ) It s going to be great . He had a fantastic start , and he has a great attitude as you witnessed again today . He s a great kid . It will be really fun to put him back out there and see how he does . Now we know what we have , so it ll be even more exciting . He s confident that he ll get it done , and he s got plenty of time . So that should be a really interesting spot .
