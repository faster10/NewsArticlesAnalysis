What is most extraordinary about all this is the level of hatred and fear that this one man has inspired within his own party . When else has any sitting senator called his own party ' s frontrunner anything remotely as scathing as : " a xenophobic , race baiting , religious bigot , " after all ? When else has the fear of the frontrunner winning the party ' s nomination brought forth such predictions of electoral disaster as : " we ' re going to get wiped out , " and " you ' re going to do irreparable damage to our party " ? If Trump wins the nomination , Hillary Clinton ' s team can just cherry pick the worst of these predictions perhaps " an utter , complete and total disaster " or " the repercussions would be devastating " to use in her general election campaign ads .
