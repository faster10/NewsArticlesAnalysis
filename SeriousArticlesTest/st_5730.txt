I have interviewed people on both sides of that anger at the embargo or at Castro , at communism or the limits to any exchange . There is a commonality to their pain : their longing to see and relate country to country , family to family . I once interviewed the Latin music stars Willy Chirino and Lissette Alvarez , both Cubans who support the embargo and raged about the traitors who traveled back . Yet they wanted so much to go some day . They wished me well when I followed the Latin rock star Juanes to Havana to cover a massive concert for peace .
