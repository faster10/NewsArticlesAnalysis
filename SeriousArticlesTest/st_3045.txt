Key player : Aside from throwing one interception , Newton was impressive on all fronts Sunday , just as he has been through his entire MVP caliber season . He was in total control of the game . He threw two touchdown passes and ran for two others . He may not be the best overall quarterback in the NFL yet . But he showed once again why he is an impact player through the air , on the ground and with leadership qualities that belie his age . He said he never gets nervous . And he never looked nervous Sunday , completing 19 of 28 passes for 335 yards .
