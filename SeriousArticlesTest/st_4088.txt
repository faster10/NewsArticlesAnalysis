Remember , when the Indianapolis Colts overcame a 28 point deficit against Kansas City in the 2013 playoffs , Houston had the defense s only sack . If both Hali and Houston can play effectively , it gives the Chiefs their best chance to pressure Texans quarterback Brian Hoyer into some passing errors . The Kansas City secondary is just waiting for that chance . With linebacker Dee Ford ( concussion ) listed as questionable as he tries to work through the NFL s protocol for clearance , the health of Hali and Houston becomes even more important . Ford also has a wrist injury to contend with , so it s not looking good for him this weekend .
