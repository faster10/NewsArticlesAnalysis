To the commenter who said price of food has not gone up : I ' m afraid you couldn ' t be more wrong . If you look at the " new and improved " sizes , the portions are actually less but the price is the same . You ' ll find it in coffee by the pound and ice cream . Anything you want to buy , it ' s less . One pop manufacturer came out with smaller cans and said it was healthier because you wouldn ' t drink so much . The smaller can are also healthier for the company ' s profit line because the prices didn ' t go down as much as the size of the can .
