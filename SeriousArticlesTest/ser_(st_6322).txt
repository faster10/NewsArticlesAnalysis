Chris : No , this is discomfort driven by sexism . Has there ever been a single reported case of sexual harassment in a professional sports environment by one player toward another ? What makes you think that because all of a sudden a player is allowed to openly be himself that he ' s immediately going to start mounting every guy in sight ? Isn ' t that the very definition of narcissistic tendencies by straight men who think that way ? What makes you think you ' re that player ' s type , or that he would ever be attracted to you ?
