' We ' re so young . We ' re so young . We ' re twenty two years old . We have so much time . There ' s this sentiment I sometimes sense , creeping in our collective conscious as we lay alone after a party , or pack up our books when we give in and go out that it is somehow too late . That others are somehow ahead . More accomplished , more specialized . More on the path to somehow saving the world , somehow creating or inventing or improving . That it ' s too late now to BEGIN a beginning and we must settle for continuance , for commencement . '
