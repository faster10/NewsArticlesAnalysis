" We were playing a show in Chicago for some union issue , and some of the other musicians on the bill were grousing about not getting paid , " Morello says . " One of the other musicians canceled the show because he had to return to his vineyard . We were on the phone kind of moaning about this , and Ben said , ' Tom , you let me know if you want me to put the hammer down . ' And I said , ' Ben , save the hammer for the man . ' And we ' re like , ' Hold on . One day , that must be a song ! ' "
