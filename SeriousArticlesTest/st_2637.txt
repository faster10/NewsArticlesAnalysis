Everything one does in the adult social media world goes down on one ' s permanent record . The experience on a site like Facebook is so involved friends lists , updates , photo streams , timelines , advertisements from the teen perspective , it ' s a Whole Big Thing . Compare that to something like Instagram . You take a picture and it goes up and out . That ' s it . Or Snapchat : You take a picture and it goes to a friend , and then it disappears . How cool is that ?
