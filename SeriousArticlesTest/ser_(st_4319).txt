What is missing from all this talk about tax is the fact that although the rich pay higher taxes than the poor , middle class people actually pay a higher percentage of their income in total taxes . True , federal income tax rates are progressive , with rates going to 35 for the top earners . But deductions and special treatment of capital gains reduce actual tax rates for the top earners . So what we end up with is upper middle class taxpayers paying the highest actual percentage of their income , over 31 , according to a 2010 study by the group Citizens for Tax Justice .
