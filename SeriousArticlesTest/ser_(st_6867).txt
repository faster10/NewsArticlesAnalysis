More than once , she ' s come running to tell me that daddy got stuck in the mud or fell forward in his wheelchair or ran out of battery while on a walk . She ' s come to me crying because she bumped her head or arm falling from her daddy ' s chair when she was climbing on it , or riding in his lap , or jumping onto the couch from his chair . Too many times I ' ve had to yell at both of them for chasing each other through the house he in his chair and she on her scooter . Too many times I ' ve had to tell them to STOP IT because they were about to get into trouble together .
