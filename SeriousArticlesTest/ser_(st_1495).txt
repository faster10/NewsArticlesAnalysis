But there s another way to see it , which is that adjusting your views under pressure is what politicians are ? supposed to do . The whole idea is that activists and journalists and pressure groups make their arguments , present their cases , and set the agenda for politicians to follow . That s how it worked under Obama , who tends ? not to be accused of being a tease ? nearly as much as Clinton . He was against gay marriage . People pressured and argued and pressured more . He switched sides and now is one of the biggest political assets that the movement has in national politics .
