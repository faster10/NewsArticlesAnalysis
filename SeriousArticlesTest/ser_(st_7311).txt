Improve American vehicles : I am 64 years old . People are talking about buying American cars . I love America , and I have bought American cars all of my life . I have bought five new vehicles during my life . I remember when my parents bought new cars . They were also American cars . You know what ? They lasted for decades . Now every time I buy a new vehicle , I usually start having big problems with them after three or four years . Most of my kids own foreign cars . I watch my children drive these cars . Maybe the metal on these cars falls apart , but the engine runs strong . Some of the cars have close to 200 , 000 miles . If the government wants to do something , start holding these car manufacturers accountable so we don ' t have to buy a new car every three to four years . We can build better engines . I know we can . We have the technology . I do buy American , but I can see where families cannot afford to keep buying American cars because they don ' t last long enough . Let ' s do something about that .
