The website , however , did not specify any specific veterans charity to which the funds would go and rather included an insignia bearing the name of the Donald J . Trump Foundation . Trump s campaign has not specified which veterans groups he will be donating to , though he said any proceeds will be spread around to a number of different organizations . Trump announced his event would benefit veterans , but it was unclear exactly which groups would receive money . They went out and fought for their country , and now Donald Trump uses them as political pawns . What will he sell the American public next ?
