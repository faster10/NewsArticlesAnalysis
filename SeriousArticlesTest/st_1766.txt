I knew how to conduct a seder at lightning speed because my parents couldn ' t wait to get to the matzo ball soup . So I have that skill , and I also sort of had an act , too . As a prize for finding the matzo , I gave out a pizza on " SNL ' s " " Weekend Update . " Producer Lorne Michaels liked it so much that he had matches printed up immediately that said " Paul Shaffer ' s Celebrity Seder " and that became legendary .
