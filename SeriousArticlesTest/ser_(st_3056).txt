Speaking in his Commons office , Mr Grayling , 50 , said : ' It isn ' t reasonable for prisoners to enjoy things that those outside on low incomes would struggle to have . My idea of prison is not sitting watching the Sky Sports Sunday match . I accept that , given they are locked up for a long time , prisoners should have access to a TV set , but it is a privilege that should be earned , not given automatically . They should not get all the frills .
