Michigan State was simply not itself for much of this season on defense especially in the secondary . The No Fly Zone turned into open air space for MSU foes through nine games . After the loss to Nebraska on Nov . 7 , the Spartans started to get healthy and gain confidence . Michigan State has only allowed 5 . 29 yards per passing attempt , good for 15th in the nation . Iowa is efficient and smart in the passing game behind quarterback C . J . Beathard , who is 13 0 as a starter . Receivers Matt VandeBerg and Tevaun Smith are dangerous , as are the Iowa tight ends .
