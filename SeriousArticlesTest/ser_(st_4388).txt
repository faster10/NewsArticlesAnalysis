To wit , Trump is reminding the Republican Party that it better tread carefully when talking about his candidacy and his controversial ? not to mention racist and likely unconstitutional ? plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States . Trump s been openly using the threat of an independent , third party run as leverage since he jumped in the campaign , and the meaningless GOP loyalty pledge he signed in September has done nothing to change that . As he told ABC News last month after rumors surfaced that GOP powerbrokers were looking to band together to take down his campaign : I will see what happens . I have to be treated fairly . He was even more specific on Twitter about what he saw as an unfair attack on his campaign : That wasn t the deal !
