There was a scary moment on Sunday for the Suns when Eric Bledsoe left the game with a leg injury , but he quickly returned and finished with 29 points , six assists , seven boards , four treys and five turnovers . His leg is fine and his owners have to be thrilled that he is returning first round value despite a high rate of turnovers . Brandon Knight was solid with 19 points , seven assists , two steals and two treys , but I m sure Bucks fans are thrilled that they traded him away for Michael Carter Williams , right ? Jason Kidd has some explaining to do . Anyways , Markieff Morris got back on track with 17 points , eight boards , one steal , one block and one trey , so this will be a welcome sight for his owners after he failed to score in double digits in his last two outings .
