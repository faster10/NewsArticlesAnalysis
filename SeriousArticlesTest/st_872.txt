No doubt , we ll hear some complaining from the candidates who have been relegated or denied invitations about the fairness of the process , but it strikes me that the process has been exceedingly fair . The participants in the undercard debates have been given three months , and most of them given three opportunities for free air time , and if they can t even register one percent in the polls at this point , then it hardly makes sense to pay their campaigns serious attention . Similarly with Christie and Huckabee , the fact of the matter is that both of these candidates have only seen their numbers decline since the debate process started . They have also both posted less than impressive fundraising numbers . If they can t average 2 . 5 percent in the national polls at this point in the race , then they don t belong on the main stage with people polling twice as high as they are and more . Perhaps either Huckabee or Christie will turn their numbers around and get back on the stage for the debate in December or January , perhaps not . That s not really something that either the debate sponsor or anyone else should worry about .
