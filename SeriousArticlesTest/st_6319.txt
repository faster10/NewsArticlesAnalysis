A . A tornado warning is issued when rotation is shown on Doppler radar or a person or verified storm chaser has actually seen a tornado . How many times do they actually see a tornado out of the rotating storm ? We know it is rotating , but we don ' t why some ( storms ) drop tornadoes and some don ' t . People are complacent because there a high percentage of false rates . If it ' s a rare event in your event in your town , you are probably less likely to that . Warnings are issued on a county by county basis . It ' s up to local officials in the county on whether they will sound the sirens . If a severe thunderstorm enters a county and there is a tornado watch in effect some counties will sound a siren . Others will only sound them when there is a tornado warning . Part of the problem is that there is not a national uniform system on what to trigger . Maybe we need to go to a Zip Code system . We can now share a warning to a small part of the county , called a polygon warning . If they send a siren off for the whole county , it increases the perceptions of false warnings . I think there needs to be another type of warning issued for confirmed tornadoes . Maybe they can pulse it , rather than blaring it .
