It ' s why the Atlanta Falcons knocking off the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC championship game at the end of the 1998 season still bothers me . That was a great game , for sure , and Atlanta earned the win . But that 15 1 Vikings team should have played a legitimately great Denver Broncos team that year in the Super Bowl . Instead we got a matchup everyone knew was lopsided , and we got a bad Super Bowl . Then there were seven months without football .
