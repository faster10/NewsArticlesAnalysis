The individual mandate by itself will have little effect on costs . This is because the main effect of the mandate is to add a relatively small number of people , about 15 million , to the insurance rolls . The vast majority of Americans , more than 250 million , already get their health insurance on the job or from public programs such as Medicare and Medicaid . The mandate alone was never going to change their health spending patterns . However , this does not mean that the court ' s decision will have no effect on health spending .
