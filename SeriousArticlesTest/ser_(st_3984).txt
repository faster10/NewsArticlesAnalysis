That s called progress , unless you re completely overrating your roster . Look , I m no fan of Smith because he runs a dinosaur Tampa 2 defense that gets picked apart in today s NFL . But anyone who knows anything about football knew that when you hired him . So if the Bucs want to give a reason for firing , don t say it was because he didn t win enough . Say the real reason : you messed up and hired the wrong guy . It s your fault , not his . Smith was exactly what he s always been .
