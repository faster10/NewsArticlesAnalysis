The only way you can normalize it is to expose it . And I m trying to do my best to expose it , and expose these people . I love my girls on my show . Why ? Because they re so normal . They re just great girls , who are smart , who love working within the community to make a difference , who all have their lives . I love that . And I love hanging out with them . We just laugh and have such a great time . But the more as I proceed and go forward , it is important for me to try to project a good image for this community .
