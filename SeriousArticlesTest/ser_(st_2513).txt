I suspect that the Republicans nominated Romney partly because he spent so much money acquiring the nomination but also because his personality seemed suitably vague . To be assigned to report on his rallies carried all the thrill of being asked to submit a 10 , 000 word critical analysis of a church picnic . His speeches were flat at best and goofy at worst . His attire was sensible trousers and shirt with the sleeves rolled up , and the family was so wholesomely large that you sensed they could swing a primary just by registering the grandkids .
