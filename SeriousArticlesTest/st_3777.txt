The president forgets that governors of both major parties speak not simply for themselves , but for their constituents . It s the regular folk on Main Street who must absorb the impact of terror when it erupts in their midst , as it did in Paris . As commander in chief , Mr Obama has an obligation to protect 320 million Americans . After seven years in office , he s clearly considers it done and has moved on to his real interest , globalism . The United States is not big enough for him . Forcing open barriers to refugees , despite the possibility that ISIS terrorists could be hiding among them , is of a piece in his drive to separate the nation from its exceptional past and usher in a post modern era to fulfill the left s long standing rallying cry : Workers of the world unite !
