I see Myanmar and all as part of learning statecraft . It doesn t worry me that much . But I do think that you need much more clarity on your goal . Most governments of India , until this one , have always defined it as eliminating poverty , illiteracy , diseases and making sure that India becomes a modern , socialist country where we solve our own social and economic problems . That is one set of goals . Yes , you have to be a great power to achieve some of those goals . But whether the time now is to concentrate on being a great power , a projecting power , and doing all the other things that go with it or focussing on organic growth from trying to transform India , that is exactly where you get into a grey area . For me , the problem is the lack of a clear strategic vision from the government , which says either we buy into what has always been or we have an alternative . Now India has grown to the stage where we can change our goals . But you need to have a discussion on that rationally and consciously . If you ( decide on the change ) , you need to signal it to the rest of the world as well , especially your neighbours . I am not sure if that has happened in the last few months .
