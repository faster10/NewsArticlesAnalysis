The Purple Tax Plan entails radical surgery . It eliminates the personal income tax , the corporate income tax , and the estate and gift tax . In their place it substitutes a highly progressive 17 . 5 federal retail sales tax plus a demogrant a monthly payment to each household , large enough that it reimburses the poor for the sales tax they ' ve paid . ( The 17 . 5 rate is the tax ' s nominal rate . Its effective rate is 15 , since 15 cents of every dollar spent goes to taxes and 85 cents to goods and services , with 15 divided by 85 equaling the 17 . 5 nominal rate . )
