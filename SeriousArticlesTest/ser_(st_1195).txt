Among the communication declassified by the PMO will be a letter sent by prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri to Bose ' s elder brother , which elicited a strongly worded response , questioning just how it was concluded that Netaji had died . He sought to know details of when and how it happened , if that was the case . PMO had declassified over 33 files on Netaji following an announcement by Modi in October 2015 after a meeting with Bose ' s family . That apart , the details related to Netaji ' s wife Emilie Schenkl , on how the Government of India disbursed her a pension of Rs 900 through its embassy and how a minister was deputed to attend her funeral are also likely to be shared with the public . A number of Parliament questions raised on Bose ' s disappearance , many by veteran BJP leader Atal Bihari Vajpayee , will also be on display at the National Archives .
