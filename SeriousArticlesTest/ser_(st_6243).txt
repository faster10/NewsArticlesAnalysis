Various ways to reform that calendar have been proposed . I like the Interregional Primary Plan put forward by Rep . Sander Levin ( D Mich . ) in 2007 . Break the country into six regions ( e . g . Region 1 : New England mid Atlantic Region 3 : upper Midwest Region 5 : Southeast etc . ) . Each region has six sub regions made up of one or more states ( e . g . , Region 1 ( A ) : Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont Region 1 ( B ) : Massachusetts Region 1 ( C ) : Connecticut , Rhode Island etc ) . Hold six primary elections , March through June , with a sub region from each larger region represented in each election . The regions would rotate through the order every four years , so over a 24 year cycle , every state will have occupied every primary and caucus slot exactly once , and each state ' s voters would have had a fair shot at influencing the process .
