Tremblay is very good , too , with Jack s basic childlike serenity : he appears mostly happy and certainly does not understand what is happening at night when he is in the wardrobe or what his actual relationship with this man is . Or rather , he seems no more subject to sadness and fear than other children on the outside . With a child s ability to accept everything , Jack is content with Room , as his total world he accepts this as we accept our world . I found myself thinking of Hamlet s remark about Denmark being a prison : I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space , were it not that I have bad dreams . You might find thoughts of The Truman Show flashing into your mind as Jack expresses his consent to everything he can see about him .
