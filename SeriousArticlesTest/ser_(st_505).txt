" He says reports of the dispute were overblown . " You see the word ' strike ' ' They ' re walking out ! ' but there was nothing to walk out from , " he says with a laugh . " That ' s always hard , because part of you wants to explain to people what ' s really going on . ' Don ' t worry , we ' re not leaving , we want to do the show . ' "
