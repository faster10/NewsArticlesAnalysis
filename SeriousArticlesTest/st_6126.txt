I went to the federation around 1pm to meet the President of the Women ' s league and the members of the commission of the league we had to discuss a lot of matters . Also present at the meeting were Hancy Lescouflair ( wife of the Minister of Sports and the Women ' s League President ) and the national head coach Jean Yves Labaze . The meeting was over and I was getting ready to leave when I felt the house shaking . I ran towards the back exit of the house . While going downstairs it was shaking really badly , I lost my balance and fell and blocks of debris fell on my hand .
