I don t really want to analyze this play too much , he said , laughing , after Sunday s 23 ? 16 ? Broncos victory over Pittsburgh . I d kind of like it to go away . He s talking , of course , about the play at the beginning of the fourth quarter , down 13 12 on his own 20 yard line . The fall . Playing dead . Call it what you will . The 39 year old Manning , untouched by a Pittsburgh defender , ended up on the turf , stood up ? and completed a 34 yard pass to receiver Emmanuel Sanders . It was ugly . It worked .
