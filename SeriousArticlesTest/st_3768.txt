I want people to feel happy ending the book . We need to feel good right now , there ' s a lot to feel bad about and that ' s something I decided with the last book , I didn ' t want people to be depressed when they finished it . I used to write very dark books but we lived in happier times . Now , the goal is to scare you , lead you into suspense but when you finish , I want you to feel happy .
