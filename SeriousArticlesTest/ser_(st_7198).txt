DEFENSE : The defense set a franchise record for fewest points allowed during the season , but couldn ' t close out the biggest game on Saturday . Playing with an injured passing shoulder , Ben Roethlisberger converted a third down play and a fourth down play before the two Bengals penalties gave them their final push into field goal range . With so many potential free agents on defense , it ' ll look a lot different next season , which is partly why the playoff meltdown hurt so much . Plus , Burfict will miss the first three games as punishment for his hit on Antonio Brown and other illegal hits during the season .
