That may still sound like a great deal , but even that 10 is a lot of money , and many states fear they won ' t have it . The second is that the individual mandate and Affordable Care Act in general will probably bring forward a lot of people who already qualified for Medicaid and just never signed up . The federal government won ' t pay for them , and a lot of states fear this expense . They feared it so much that they brought a case against the expansion that made it all the way to the Supreme Court .
