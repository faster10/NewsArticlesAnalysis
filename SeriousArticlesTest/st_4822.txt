But there s more to it than that . You see , Kansas was No . 2 in the AP Poll this week , one spot behind No . 1 Michigan State and one place above No . 3 Oklahoma . Since Michigan State lost and is still without Denzel Valentine , it s pretty safe to assume that the Spartans are going to fall , at least past the undefeated Sooners . But in the Coaches Poll , Oklahoma was No . 2 this week and Kansas was No . 3 , meaning that , barring something weird happening , we re looking at a situation where the No . 1 team in the AP Poll will be facing off with the No . 1 team in the Coaches Poll .
