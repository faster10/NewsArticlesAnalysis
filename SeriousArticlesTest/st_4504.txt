The patent law was put to judicial scrutiny by multinational drug companies and they have failed to sneak in evergreening . Swiss company Novartis fought a seven year long case when its claim to a new patent on an existing cancer drug was rejected by the Indian patent office . In this case , the Supreme Court ruled that claims on new forms of known substances did not meet the patentability requirement in Indian patent law . Then in 2012 , the government evoked a clause in the patent law that empowers it to grant a compulsory license for manufacture of any patented drug in the interest of public health . An Indian company was allowed to manufacture a cancer drug patented by a foreign firm , in public interest . This brought the price of the drug down by 97 per cent .
