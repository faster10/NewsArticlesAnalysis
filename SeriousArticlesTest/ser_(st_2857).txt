When I was in high school , I was the leader of the my school ' s small Christian Fellowship . I went to a private co ed prep school in New Haven , Connecticut , called Hopkins School , and I distinctly remember during my junior year during the day of silence I was wearing an ally sticker in support of my friends who were silent . In class that day , an older friend came up to me and said , ' " Look , Jay , I respect you but you need to take that ally sticker off man . You ' re condoning their sinful actions . You can ' t support them and be the leader of a Christian organization . "
