A senior medical officer of Anti retroviral therapy ( ART ) centre in Surat said that improved services at ART centres and increased awareness has also led to fall in new infections . " Once an infected patient is introduced to ART drugs , viral load of HIV goes down in his body and transmission risks decreases . This coupled with number of awareness campaigns and safe sex practices has started giving positive results and we hope it will serve its purpose in another 10 years , " said Dr Alap Mehta , senior medical officer of Surat ART center .
