" This is life . One minute , you ' re hoisting a trophy , and the next minute you ' re in the hospital , " Kerr said . " Everybody , every human being , experiences that in their own existence , no matter what job you ' re doing . You have highs and lows , health issues , great joy and great pain and all that . It ' s part of life , and you gotta just fight through and get back to where you want to be . And that ' s the journey I ' ve been on . "
