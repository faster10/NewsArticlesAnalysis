Skeletons are ubiquitous and preserve for long periods of time . Of course , all of the soft tissues have decomposed . The skeleton alone gives us limited information . Mummies are another option , but they are very limited in number and geographical distribution . In the case of Egyptian mummies , they have had all their internal organs removed . Coprolites , or fossilized human feces , which can be found in dry caves , can provide detailed information about diet and intestinal disease . But they are generally quite rare .
