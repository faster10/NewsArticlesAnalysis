As for those artists that are not mainstream , there are plenty of bands I still buy albums from . Albums that reflect excellent songwriting skills usually 100 percent of the time from the artists themselves . More important , those artists put on great , non lip syncing live shows which make you appreciate them even more . So yeah , I say if the record companies are going to ruin the integrity of music by releasing crap , then download mainstream albums , but the underground world has plenty that a real music fan would enjoy .
