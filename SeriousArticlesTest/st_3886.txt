There had been reports of loud sounds in Beebe before the reports of birds falling began to come in . It ' s possible the sounds made the birds disoriented , and they went into sudden , chaotic flights , crashing into each other and into objects , White said . " You ' re disturbed , you ' re disoriented , you ' re trying to figure out where you are . We have seen some stuff like this before when there ' s heavy dense fog , and they ' ll run into towers and power lines , " she said .
