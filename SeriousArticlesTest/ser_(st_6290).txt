Around 20 per cent of fur comes not from farms , but trapping wild animals . These creatures , claim the pro fur campaigners , are often killed quickly and humanely . Some are culled to help balance animal populations and native ecosystems . In New Zealand . for example , the government has encouraged people to buy what they call ' the world ' s most ecological fur ' that of the paihamu , a small , non native , furry animal that has been wreaking havoc on native species .
