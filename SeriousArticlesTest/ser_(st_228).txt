Mountain West Championship : Air Force at San Diego State ( 4 . 5 ) : San Diego State has been at its best in the Mountain West , riding Donnell Pumphrey ' s 6 . 1 yards per touch average to an undefeated conference record . The Aztecs caught some breaks with their schedule , given the strength of the MW ' s West Division compared to the MW Mountain , but a one dimensional Air Force team should not scare a seasoned , defensive veteran like Rocky Long . The Falcons made life uncomfortable for Michigan State in September , but its most impressive wins came against Boise State and Utah State , two teams that I might consider underdogs to San Diego State on a neutral field . Pick : Aztecs 4 . 5 .
