One , the President is lying , and quite effectively . If he knew that the website wouldn ' t be up to snuff , or that millions of Americans would not , in fact , be able to keep their insurance plans if they liked them , then he simply made a calculation that many politicians make : Lies aren ' t necessarily fatal . Except when they are . Just ask Richard " I ' m not a crook " Nixon , George " Read my lips " Bush , or George " WMD " Bush .
