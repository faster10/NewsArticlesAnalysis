Coughlin : Yes , he won two Super Bowls and could be in the Hall of Fame one day . If that guy still existed , however , he ' d still be the head coach of the Giants . Today ' s Coughlin , ? who will turn 70 before the season starts , is 19 29 the past three years . ? Only one of 18 coaches who have made it through three years , has a worst record in that time ? Gus Bradley , who is 12 36 with the Jaguars . Then again , Lurie liked Bradley , too . Coughlin is also 1 5 vs . the Eagles the past three years . Can ' t beat ' em , coach ' em .
