Rampling is up for an Academy Award for best actress , and while Brie Larson ( " Room " ) has the edge , simply because " 45 Years " is subtler , if there ' s any justice this veteran screen star ( 70 next month ) will be recognized . She plays Kate as a somewhat cool character , watchful and reserved . It ' s as if the character had been living a life of considerable satisfaction and considerable love , yet something was a bit off , always . We see in " 45 Years " how any two people , whether they get a life changing letter out of the blue or not , must learn to deal with their vulnerabilities or risk being encased in ice .
