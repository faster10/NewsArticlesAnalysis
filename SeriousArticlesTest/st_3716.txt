I wasn t thinking about that because it s not about me . It s bigger . It s not about Chris Rock hosting . It s not about the potential black presenters . Me and Tonya are not gonna be there . We re going to the Knick game against the Miami Heat . We ll be at the world s most famous arena , Madison Square Garden , 33rd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue at my two courtside seats . You will not see us on the Left Coast . I know we re going to be on the right side of history .
