Adults enjoyed the sly edge of the animated feature , and their kids fell in love with the yellow " minions , " which became breakout characters in the same vein as Madagascar ' s penguins or Ice Age ' s acorn chasing squirrel , Scrat . For Despicable Me 2 , Universal is plastering the minions on any free ad space they can . The studio has inked licensing deals with Wal Mart , Toys R Us , Progressive , Chiquita , Cheetos , McDonalds , and other national brands .
