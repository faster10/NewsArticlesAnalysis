That is the single biggest challenge that the Arab world has . It is what we are teaching our students , our youth , the people that are going to come into the economy in the coming 20 years . Are we going to teach them skills that will allow them to create their own jobs , that will allow them to become entrepreneurs , that will allow them to become business people , to become innovators , to become creators ? Or are we going to continue to think that the traditional way of making money is the only way ?
