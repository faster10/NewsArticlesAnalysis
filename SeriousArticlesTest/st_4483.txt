2 . Carson ' s rough evening : Newton is the probable MVP , but Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer arguably had just as good a regular season if not better . Sunday , Palmer was rattled right from the start . He missed a bunch of throws low and wide of his receivers , fired a few passes directly at defensive backs ( it often seemed as if he had no idea what coverage he was facing ) , and simply overshot a few more . He was picked off four times and had at least one more easy interception dropped . He fumbled twice as well .
