The report makes no mention of whether the airline attempted to contact the airplane directly through satellite calls or data link messages . At 03 : 30 a . m . , almost an hour after the airline ' s last report put the aircraft in normal condition east of Vietnam , its operations center reported the position was based on a prediction of the flight ' s progress , not its actual position . Controllers expanded their contact attempts to include the Hong Kong and Beijing air traffic control centers , which also had no contact with the aircraft .
