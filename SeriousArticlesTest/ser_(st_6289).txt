? ? A new biography of George H . W . Bush is sure to generate lots of buzz , especially some digs he takes at his son s vice president : ? In interviews with biographer Jon Meacham , the 41st president said Dick Cheney ( who had served as his Defense Secretary ) built his own empire and asserted too much hard line on his son s White House . He also called Don Rumsfeld an arrogant fellow who served the president badly , according to the New York Times Peter Baker , who writes up the book . ? He had his own empire there and marched to his own drummer , the elder Bush said of Cheney . It just showed me that you cannot do it that way . The president should not have that worry . The big mistake that was made was letting Cheney bring in kind of his own State Department . I think they overdid that . But it s not Cheney s fault . It s the president s fault . The buck stops there .
