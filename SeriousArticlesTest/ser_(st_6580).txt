An unknown soldier in Afghanistan first found Bear last year and brought him to a local Afghan animal shelter . The shelter wasn ' t able to care for Bear , so it contacted Farthing , who now runs a charity for stray and abandoned animals , primarily dogs from Afghanistan . Farthing ' s Nowzad Dogs is named for the Afghan town where he was based for a few months in 2006 . He asked Mayhew International , an arm of London ' s Mayhew Animal Home , to help find Bear a new home .
