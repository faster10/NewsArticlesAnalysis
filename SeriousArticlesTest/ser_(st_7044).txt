The standard response to Minsky ' s concern that the spenders can ' t afford it and the savers aren ' t spending is that monetary policy should focus on ensuring price stability , while the macroprudential policy aims to safeguard financial stability by limiting borrowing by highly indebted agents . But this approach does not work . If macroprudential policy limited additional credit to marginal borrowers effectively , monetary policy would have no impact on demand ( as long as the most solvent agents refuse to spend more ) .
