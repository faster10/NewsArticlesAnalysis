Trump is also extending his support beyond the initial round of voting . A new KTVT TV Dixie Strategies of Texas poll found that Donald Trump was behind Ted Cruz by just five points ? 30 percent to 25 percent . While Trump had led the last time this poll was taken in October , he has kept the gap to a manageable distance despite Ted Cruz having the home state advantage . If Trump were to turn in decisive wins in Iowa and New Hampshire , he could head into Texas voting with a head of steam and by that point could have the support of any other candidates who may have bowed out .
