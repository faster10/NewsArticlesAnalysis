The ability of the FTSE 100 to perform is clearly being hindered by tumbling oil prices , and with Brent hitting a new six year low , the likelihood is that this will hold back this market for some time yet . As Shell , BG and BP lead the FTSE losers , the fate of the FTSE is in the hands of the dollar as another Fed fuelled dollar rally could send crude tumbling once more . With OPEC seeming less and less like a cartel and more like an audience with the Saudis , it is likely crude prices could fall further yet .
