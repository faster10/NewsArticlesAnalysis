SS : From what I understand , we all want ISIS down , right , that is our biggest interest , this is a common threat we re facing , we re in a generational long fight against fundamental Islam , so Turkish links to ISIS and to the oil trade with the terror group have been known , and have been a concern way before this whole thing happened with Russia . So , my question is , could we really expect Turkey who is somewhat of an ally to fight against ISIS when it profits from it ?
