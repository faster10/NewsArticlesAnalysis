Why else did the NFL put this game on a Saturday afternoon on ESPN you ignorant dorks And for those idiots last week crying and whining about why the NFC playoff games are both on Sunday . Maybe if you had a clue about the NFL and the what the motives were you would know they didn t want to put both Vikings and Packers who played the late Sunday night game on a Saturday . . But , no you wouldn t know that because most of you would just emotionally react like a 12 year old girl and not even use their brain . . go back to school !
