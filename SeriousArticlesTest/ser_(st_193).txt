Instead , Manning has been absolutely terrible : He s thrown nine touchdown passes and 17 interceptions and his 67 . 6 quarterback rating is the worst of his career . Manning has missed the Broncos last two games with a partially torn plantar fascia , and his season ( and arguably career ) reached its nadir Sunday night when he took the field at Mile High clad in dad jeans and a baseball cap and sat on the sideline as his great adversary Tom Brady battled the Broncos in a Sunday night classic .
