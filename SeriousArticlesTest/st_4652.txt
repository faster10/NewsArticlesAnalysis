If you aren ' t yet ready to own a 3 D printer , you can still start 3 D printing without one . New companies such as Shapeways enable you to upload 3 D designs or browse among a marketplace of products from other designers , then print the goods for you and ship them to your home . Or if you ' d like to try a whole new 3 D printing concept in general , sign up to be one of the first to demo the 3Doodler , a pen that lets you draw products into reality .
