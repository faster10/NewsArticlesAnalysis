But I remember that morning , sitting on a couch in the football building , when Pinkel walked up . It was just a couple of us there . No PR people . He was a completely different human . He was human . You remember random things over the years , and what s stuck with me was ? he made a point to say he spoke with his children . They weren t in New York or D . C . But it just felt right for him to hear their voices on that day . It was a sweet , fleeting moment , but I m reminded of it as I talked to my own father today , about Paris , and about Pinkel .
