If it wasn ' t for the 8 month old who had tugged my shawl and looked at me with such sadness and innocence during my field visit to a women ' s prison in Kathmandu , I might never have understood the horrifying reality of children growing up in prison nor done anything about it . Seven years later , SanuKanchi is a bright , loving 8 year old living with her mother in Kathmandu , and I have a big family of 50 kids and a team of hard working , compassionate staff helping me take care of them .
