The unsettled West Bromwich Albion striker is stirring for a move away from the Hawthorns . Tottenham had two bids rejected for the forward in the Summer but are yet to move in for the former England Under 21s man . Whilst Spurs may move late on deadline day to secure a deal they could also face competition from Newcastle . Steve McClaren is thought to be interested in bringing Berahino to the club to form an English triumvirate with Jonjo Shelvey and Andros Townsend . However , Albion chairman Jeremy Peace is thought to be unwilling to sell to a relegation rival .
