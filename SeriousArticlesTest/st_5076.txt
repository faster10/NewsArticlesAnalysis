ANYTHING FOR A VOTE Melissa Jeltsen : " Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie vetoed a bill on Monday that would have strengthened mechanisms for removing guns from domestic violence abusers . Under existing state law , individuals convicted of domestic violence or subject to a final restraining order are barred from possessing or buying guns . However , the law doesn t require that offenders actually surrender the firearms they own , which makes the ban challenging to enforce . The proposed legislation would have required those prohibited from owning guns to turn them over to law enforcement or sell them within a short period of time . . . Christie issued a conditional veto , returning the bill to the state legislature with his suggestions . The governor ' s proposed changes include increasing penalties for domestic violence offenders and simplifying the process of arming domestic violence victims . " HuffPost
