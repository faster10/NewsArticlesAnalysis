To my ? OscarsSoWhite folks who are angry at the absurd lack of diversity highlighted yet again by this year ' s Oscar noms . Trust me , I get it . Those of us in the industry who labor to make the best content we can are especially sensitive to a perceived systemic bias against a group of people or type of film . One thing I will say , is that The Academy ' s voting record is only part of the issue . These films performances and the scripts that drive them often go into development YEARS before they are released and thus in Oscar contention . We need more content produced by , written by , directed by and featuring filmmakers and actors of color being given the greenlight . We need them to start moving forward this year so in 2019 there are quality projects in contention ! Although there were multiple performances and films that existed this year ( and were overlooked ) , we still need more . We need those of us in the industry , and those outside trying to get in , to continue to push Hollywood to create opportunities for these films so that we have more than a handful each year .
