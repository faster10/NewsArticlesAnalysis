ShouldaWoulda : ? The funniest thing about this whole mess for Spike and the current Mrs Smith is that it kills them that Chris Rock is hosting the show and the head of the Academy is full of flava and they can ' t say anything . If they were purists they would be demanding that Rock step out and the head of the Academy step down in solidarity . Not happening , Spike should stick to what he knows , making a minstrel fool out of Chuck Barkley , no racism there .
