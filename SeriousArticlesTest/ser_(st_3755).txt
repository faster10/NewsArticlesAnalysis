In the late ' 80s , I was trained as a crisis intervention counselor and I volunteered on a domestic violence hotline for four years . Abusers typically have a Jekyll and Hyde personality . In public , an abuser often acts like a " friendly guy " or a " nice neighbor , " but in private he may be pure evil . Most victims are terrified to come forward fearing no one will believe them because neighbors and friends never witness the abuse . I ' m sure friends of the actor Michael Jace , for example , who is accused of murdering his wife were shocked to learn that such a " friendly " guy might be capable of such evil .
