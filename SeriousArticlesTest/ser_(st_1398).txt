" I ' ve been unemployed and it sucks . . . BUT you do whatever you have to to get work you dig ditches , you wash dishes , empty trash , you may even have to move your home , " wrote mikemc58 . " Point is you have to think outside the box and get out of your comfort zone . Wishes and dreams aren ' t going to do it . Get off your butt hit the streets everyday asking , looking , volunteering , for a job . And listening to Obama drone on about how good the economy is useless , because as we all know , ' we ' who live in the REAL world know it ' s NOT . GOV is not the answer , personal responsibility and self motivation is the key to finding new work . "
