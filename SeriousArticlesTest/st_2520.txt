Miller has said he doesn t know how many tattoos he has , but began getting inked before enrolling at Texas A M in 2007 . In college he majored in poultry sciences ( yes , the study of chickens ) , which inspired one tattoo featuring a chicken leg , a watermelon slice , a dollar sign and a Pacman esque ghost representing a hater . Some people called out the recently drafted rookie for being racist , but he reminded the inquiring parties that the chicken leg was simply a shout out to his favorite fowl .
