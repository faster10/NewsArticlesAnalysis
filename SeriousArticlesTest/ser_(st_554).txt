Mason Jennings : It ' s surprising . For this one , I didn ' t even think about other people . What would I like to do ? If no one is going to hear this , what would it sound like ? So I was just recording tons of songs in the winter by myself , and I ended up putting out what I had done . I thought there would be no reviews or people would just ignore it . So it ' s great to have this kind of reaction to the album .
