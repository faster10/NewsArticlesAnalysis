After losing wide receiver Jordy Nelson in the preseason , Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared to be fine without him throughout the first part of the season . For whatever reason , the Packers offense started to struggle in the second half , and they lost the division to the Minnesota Vikings . After a convincing 17 point win on the road against the Washington Redskins , the Packers appear to be firing on all cylinders . Unfortunately for the Packers , they have to play the Arizona Cardinals on the road , a team that has an elite offense and defense , and a team that just destroyed them by 30 points a few weeks ago . While this game will be closer , the Cardinals are going to defeat the Packers by at least a touchdown .
