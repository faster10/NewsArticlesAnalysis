I ' m not actually a big proponent of building pyramids . But " Ukrainian democracy " , I like it . What is more , it feeds me . Not in the sense that it provides some kind of social security and promises a good retirement . No ! With enviable regularity " Ukrainian democracy " feeds me with plots for novels , as well as offering so many potential fictional heroes that no one writer could fit it all in even if he writes two thick novels in a year .
