We worried about the relationship between Ben and Isabel . A lot . Every time she said that she didn ' t like him or want him around , we worried that it was because of his injury . We made a big deal out of it . We stressed about it . We talked to her teachers about it . We talked to a counselor about it . We thought that our daughter wouldn ' t connect with her dad because of his injury . It turns out we were wrong . Very wrong .
