Easily one of the most famous American highways , a journey along US 101 is the reason for many a trip . The road starts on the Olympic Peninsula across Puget Sound from Seattle . Then it curves around to the Pacific , which it never strays far from all the way south . The views become spectacular at Astoria , Oregon and never diminish as you pass the giant redwoods of Northern California right until San Francisco . Although many people opt for Hwy 1 south of here , staying with US 101 takes you through Steinbeck Country and Salinas and on past the historic 17th century Spanish missions that once lined what was then called the El Camino Real . At Paso Robles , hundreds of wineries vie for attention before the highway encounters the beautiful Southern California coast and follows the beaches through Santa Barbara . Further on it picks up the evocative name Hollywood Freeway and ends near downtown Los Angeles .
