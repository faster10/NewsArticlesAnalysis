All of that 0 . 24 yards per carry difference ( and more ) can be explained by a drop in yards per carry before contact , indicating that the run blocking has not been quite as good since the Packers returned from their bye week . Before the bye , Starks and Lacy averaged 1 . 80 yards before contact per carry , but since then that number has dropped to 1 . 52 yards per carry . It ' s only through an increase in post contact yards from Lacy that the Packers have come close to the same overall per carry production .
