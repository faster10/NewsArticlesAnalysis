Oh , the irony of perhaps seeing Bengals backup quarterback A . J . McCarron earn his first career playoff victory while the still healing Andy Dalton and his 0 ? 4 postseason record watches from the sidelines in Paul Brown Stadium . Now that would be a plot twist no one was predicting back when this time to get it done season started in Cincinnati . McCarron showed me enough in his three start late season stint to believe the end of the Bengals 25 year playoff victory drought could be at hand late Saturday night . Taking care of the football is McCarron s top priority , but he also has to be able to let it rip when opportunities for big plays present themselves .
