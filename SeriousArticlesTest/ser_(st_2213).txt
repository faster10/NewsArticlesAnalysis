Rubio , of course , would never be mistaken for Trump , nor does he want to be . And he doesn t need Ernst to act as a Palin esque hot mess to give him a bump . But , as I explained last week , he does need his friends in the Republican establishment to get off their hands and offer more than a few tepid words of not an official endorsement support if he has any chance at besting Trump or Ted Cruz before it s too late . Marco can t save the Republican Party if the GOP doesn t save him first .
