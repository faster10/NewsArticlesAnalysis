Senreich : Geeks are into what is considered pop culture as if it were a science , in a sense , where they know all the little intricacies that nobody else would pay attention to . Whereas a nerd is more book smart , and is the guy in math class who can answer a million different scientific equations . That was the definition we always used at Wizard . We always catered to the geeks , and the nerds would end up reading if they wanted but may not . Nerds are more high brow .
