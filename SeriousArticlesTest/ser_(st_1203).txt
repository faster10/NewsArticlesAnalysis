This is a global problem as much as it is a regional challenge . We re going to have to figure out how is this idea of this radical version of Islam , how is it promoted , and the influence that it gets in areas like social media ? they leverage the information , domain , the digital age of information very , very effectively . That also has to have an international component to it in terms how do we stop that how do we work together to defeat this idea ? the way it s spreading . When I look at that and think what countries they are from and definitely from Russia , and definitely from the US . The numbers are different because I think of the geographic proximity . But still the problem is the same . . .
