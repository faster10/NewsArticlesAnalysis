Since Hollywood seems conditioned to follow the franchise or blockbuster film model , with movies that , at best , ? have one representative black face in the cast , how does Hollywood fertilize its soil and nurture a new crop of artists and filmmakers of color who don t just have great stories to tell , but who can also bring in box office ? ? ( Think ? Ryan Coogler , director of ? Creed , and ? Ava DuVernay , director of ? Selma . ) It s as if Hollywood can only keep the names of a few black actors on its list at any point in time . ? ( Think Kevin Hart , Michael B . Jordan , Chadwick Boseman . ) ? Black actors and actresses aren ' t the only victims . The moviegoing public misses their artistic gifts and Hollywood loses ? out because there are more Harts , Jordans , Bosemans ? who could be winning ? box office as well , given a chance .
