Hillary gets stronger with Democrats . But that s not the case with the electorate at large : Meanwhile , in the Democratic race , Hillary Clinton has increased her lead over Bernie Sanders after he strong October ( debate , Biden not running , Benghazi testimony ) : She s ahead of him by 31 points ( 62 31 ) in our new NBC WSJ poll ? ? up from 25 points earlier in October ( 58 33 ) . The percentage of Democrats saying they could see themselves supporting her increased as well , from 81 in mid October , to 85 now . But her overall positive negative number barely moved ( 39 48 in mid October , 40 47 now ) . And her personal attributes didn t really move , including those giving her high marks for being honest and straightforward ( just 26 in mid October , 27 now ) . She has regained her commanding position with Democrats , says NBC WSJ co pollster Fred Yang ( D ) . Yet despite arguably her best few weeks of the campaign starting with the Las Vegas debate , she shows little upward movement with the rest of the electorate .
