At a campaign stop in South Carolina yesterday , Jeb Bush said , It s like the crabs in the , you know , whatever ? the crabs in the boiling water . After being corrected by a local voter , he added , The frogs . You think it s warm , and it feels pretty good and then it feels like you re in a whirlpool ? you know , a Jacuzzi or something . Bush concluded , And then you re dead . That s how this works . Good to know .
