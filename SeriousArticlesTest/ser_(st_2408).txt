Meanwhile the president has somehow hidden from public view behind the very high and well protected fence of his country residence . Near to it a new building with an office for the president was constructed . Strange , but when completed this new building immediately became the property of some Cypriot off shore company that the government now pays monthly rent to . It means he will only visit his official office in Kiev when absolutely necessary . For example when presidents of western countries come to their senses and stop their boycott of him . Until that moment he may remain alone in his " Cypriot " forest land of the former state residence " Mezhygorye " that as it turned out now , too , belongs to the Cypriot off shore company . He is secluding himself , I think , to sit down at a large , multi volume novel .
