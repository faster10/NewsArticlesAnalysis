" I thought our guys did a great job of mixing things up . I thought Travis did an outstanding job of staying with the game plan we had , maybe during some tough innings , where there were some situations pitch count wise , where he had to get away from the fastballs , and they did , and still managed to throw some strikes and get some outs . ? We ' ve got to continue to do that , because that ' s pitching . I don ' t care how hard you throw , you ' ve got to mix them up a bit . "
