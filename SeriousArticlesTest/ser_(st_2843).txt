Of course , the biggest news is that Iowa is about to kick off primary season , and all the wonks will finally ( finally ! ) have some solid voting data to pore over , rather than just relying on sheer speculation ( as we ' ve all been doing , up to this point ) . The race is about as close as can be , at least between first and second places in both parties . Will Trump beat Cruz ? Will Bernie surprise Hillary ? Stay tuned ! Monday night will be an exciting moment , no matter what happens .
