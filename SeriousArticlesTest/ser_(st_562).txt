" I went to my hotel room and Suge was in there with several people , " Van Winkle said during a 1999 VH1 " Behind the Music " episode about his career . " He let me know he wanted to get some points off the record ' Ice Ice Baby . ' Suge took me out on the balcony , started talking to me personally . He had me look over the edge , showing me how high I was up there . I needed to wear a diaper that day . I was an ' investor ' in Death Row Records with no return on my money . "
