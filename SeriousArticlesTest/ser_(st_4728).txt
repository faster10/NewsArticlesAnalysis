I think as Tom released the football , the line judge lost track of maybe where the ball was at that point and almost by its own definition , inadvertently blew the whistle , he explained . What we do from that point onward is find out where the football was at the time the whistle was blown . We deemed it to be , in our judgement , received by the receiver , as we stated , at the 45 yard line , I believe . And then by rule , what you do with that , or once you determine in your judgement where the ball was at the time of the whistle , if it s in a possession of a player , which we deemed it to be , you take all fouls then , that would have been on that play and you enforce them from that spot of where the ball would be declared dead by the inadvertent whistle .
