The concept of " Republican nominee Donald Trump " is already causing a lot of panic in certain Republican circles . This panic is effused with naked fear , since nobody really has any bright ideas for how to avoid such a fate . But this previously unthinkable concept is now looming as the most likely outcome , if the polls can be believed . In the coming weeks , look for the levels of panic and fear to rise dramatically within the Republican Party establishment . Already , many of them are publicly admitting that the 2016 election could be a disaster of Barry Goldwater sized proportions ( if they were Democrats , of course , it would be " of George McGovern sized proportions " ) . Whether this is correct or not remains anyone ' s guess , at this point . But what ' s striking is that the unthinkable is now being thought about very hard , and with much handwringing in Republican circles .
