' I ' ve learned a lot of lessons in the last seven years . If someone had told me to meet Steve Black when I was 20 , I would probably have politely declined . You don ' t think about those things at that age , but as you get older you mature and see things in a different light . You grow up and gaps in your life get filled . I just feel like I ' m in a much wiser position and more stable . But I ' m only 27 , so I ' m a good three or four years off my peak and I can still shift about a bit ! '
