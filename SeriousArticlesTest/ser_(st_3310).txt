Wilson was under extreme pressure in the fourth quarter and about to take a sack of about 20 yards from ? defensive end Everson Griffen , but got free just long enough to throw the ball away and get it past the line so there was no intentional grounding . It was an impressive athletic play to get the pass off . Instead of being at midfield with second and long , it was second and 10 at the Vikings ' 29 . The Seahawks gained just 1 more yard but kicker Steven Hauschka was still in field goal range . He made a 46 yarder to give Seattle a 10 9 lead it wouldn ' t give up .
