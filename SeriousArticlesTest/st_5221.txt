I see this particular pope as more progressive but I wouldn t call him an ally like US President Obama , said Frank Mugisha , a prominent gay leader . I would like to see his position very clearly because what he said came as a by the way when he said he can t judge . Pope Francis famously said : Who am I to judge ? in referring to a purportedly gay priest . He has called for a Catholic Church that is more tolerant and welcoming for those on the margins , including gays . ?
