Eyestrain doesn ' t worsen vision , but it ' s not comfortable , either . For healthier viewing , remind your children not to watch in total darkness the sharp contrast between the room and the TV can worsen strain and have them plop down about ten feet away . But if you have a child who ' s always sitting really close , she may be having a hard time seeing . Ask her to scooch to a more normal distance , and if she can ' t see the screen clearly , get her eyes checked .
