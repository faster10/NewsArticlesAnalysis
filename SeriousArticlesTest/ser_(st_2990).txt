For the U . S . , there won ' t be any rush to Iran . Apart from the business and political concerns , American companies and individuals , with few exceptions , are blocked by the 1995 U . S . trade embargo on Iran from engaging in dealings with Iran or its government . In the early 1990s American exports to Iran topped 600 million , but in recent years shipments , mostly grains , have totaled less than half that . Even non Americans remain barred from transactions or activities that support export of goods or services from the U . S . to Iran .
