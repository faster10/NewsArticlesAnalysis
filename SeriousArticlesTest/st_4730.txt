Michigan health officials said they can t conclude that the increase in Legionnaires cases was related to Flint s water . But Marc Edwards , an environmental engineering professor at Virginia Tech who investigated high lead levels in Flint , tells The Associated Press it was very likely . He said the risk of exposure to Legionella bacteria appeared to be low in homes and small buildings , based on his tests last year , but high levels were detected in larger buildings before the city switched back to the Detroit water system last fall . This problem is probably behind us , he said on a Flint water study website .
