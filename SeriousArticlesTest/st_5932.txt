Most of the acting nominations were expected , but some were pleasantly surprising . It is a beautiful thing to see Lily Tomlin get her due with a nomination for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy for her tough loving , lesbian poet grandmother in Grandma . The same goes for her Grace and Frankie costar Jane Fonda , who makes the most of her limited screen time in Youth as an aging movie star who fails to hide her desperation behind layers of mascara . Al Pacino also snagged a best actor nomination for Danny Collins , an all but forgotten dramedy released in March in which he plays an aging rocker who decides to change his hard living ways .
