Ever since high school , I ve been called a slut . All the boys were attracted to me ? that wasn t my fault ! Then , when I started getting famous , the shaming got even worse . All these messed up stories came out about me , and I was like , That s not true ! I m not that kind of girl ! But even things I had done ? things a man would never be judged for me ? got me lots of hate .
