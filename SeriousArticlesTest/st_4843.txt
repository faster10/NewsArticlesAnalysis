But the army did not act alone . It was enabled to move by mass popular protests that temporarily brought extremely disparate groups together united only by their opposition to Morsy . The lesson the protesters will be drawing is that protests still work . While Egypt ' s future is too uncertain to make it a model that others immediately want to emulate , this fresh demonstration of the power of the street will again inspire protest movements elsewhere in the Arab world , whether demonstrating against long established authoritarian regimes , or newer elected Islamist counterparts . Just as the protesters may in time grow more skeptical about the role of the army , the authoritarian governments that are welcoming the change in Egypt may also come to regret applauding a fresh uprising .
