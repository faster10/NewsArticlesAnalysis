' If you look for faults and pessimism , you ' ll find it . For me , I just get on with it . We had Tuesday and Wednesday with Kenny and our day off yesterday , so nothing was discussed . It ' s just one of these things . I totally respect how the gaffer is feeling , but we still have a job to do and I ' m sure he ' ll be no different . When he crosses the line in training he ' ll still be the Kenny we know . '
