The public sector union machine , once a colossus of Democratic power , looks weak in the wake of Walker ' s triumph . With mandatory union dues now extinct , union membership has withered in Wisconsin . AFSCME ' s Local 24 in Madison has seen its ranks drop from 22 , 300 to 7 , 100 , while AFSCME ' s statewide membership has been cut in half . In short , Walker has broken the long running cycle of handoffs and paybacks between union leadership and state politicians .
