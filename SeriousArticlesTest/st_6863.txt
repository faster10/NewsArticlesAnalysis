I do not remember my daughter ' s first Christmas . My parents and sisters spent it with her while I was in the hospital with my husband . I went from hugging and snuggling her before the accident to barely being able to look at her without crying . I couldn ' t even hold her because the responsibility of being a " single parent " in the physical sense was so overwhelming , I shut down . Every single minute of the day , I begged someone to fix my husband .
