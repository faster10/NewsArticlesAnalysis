But I ' m also sitting here wondering how in the world the Dallas defense is supposed to stop the sudden juggernaut that is the Panthers ' offense . Do people still think this is that popgun unit they ' ve had the last few years ? Because it ' s not . Carolina is scoring 29 . 9 points per game , the third best average in the NFL . Cam ' s crew has scored 20 plus points in every single game and hasn ' t scored less than 27 since Week 2 . Yes , his top receivers are still Ted Ginn and Devin Funchess ( if Philly Brown sits again ) , but nobody has stopped these guys yet why should we think Brandon Carr and Morris Claiborne will ?
