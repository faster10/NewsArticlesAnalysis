Gordon has the type of ability to shock folks , and this was a doozy . This was his first at bat against Familia , who hadn ' t blown a save since the Mets ' toughest regular season defeat , a loss at home to the Padres that came via a Justin Upton home run in the rain . That was the day before the Mets acquired Yoenis Cespedes . Familia had allowed only one home run since then , and looked like New York ' s new Mariano Rivera .
