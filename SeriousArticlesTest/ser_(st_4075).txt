Additionally , Tuesday night ' s contest could take on a bit more of a historical flair . Chicago head coach Joel Quenneville will be seeking his 782nd career victory behind the bench . His next victory will tie him with legendary New York Islanders head coach Al Arbour for second on the all time wins list . He still has a ways to go to try to catch Scotty Bowman , who holds the record with 1 , 244 career wins , but being in that kind of company is special on its own . The Blackhawks will spend their next two games on the road , so if they have a chance to get him closer to passing Arbour while on home ice , it should make for a nice moment for the head coach who has become a local icon in Chicago . If he ' s not beloved like Mike Ditka yet , he ' s at least the most famous mustache in Chicago since Da Coach .
