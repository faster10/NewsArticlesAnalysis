As the drug violence has escalated in the last decade , producers have made films about the true life killers involved . One such movie is called Comandante Antrax , the nickname of Jose Rodrigo Arechiga , the head of assassins who worked for Guzman . Arechiga was arrested in Holland in 2014 , and sentenced in California last year . In some cases , the traffickers have admitted to paying producers to make the films . When Edgar Valdez , alias The Barbie , was arrested in 2010 , he told an interrogator he paid 200 , 000 to filmmakers to shoot his biopic .
