Yet African art is alive . One cannot view the pulsating wall length panels of Victor Ehikhamenor , or the playful metal work of Sokari Douglas Camp and declare these pieces artifacts . Nor view the sculptures of Gon alo Mabunda made from recycled AK47s and say these are artists working with only traditional materials . Nor listen to the acoustic art of Emeka Ogboh and say this new generation is confined to the usual mediums . The art coming from Africa today is as varied , vibrant , exhilarating and bewildering as contemporary art from anywhere in the world .
