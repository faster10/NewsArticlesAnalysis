In 2007 , Japanese researchers revealed the results of a massive study on bystander intervention . They looked at cases where a person ( not in a hospital ) suffered cardiac arrest in view of a bystander and with his or her heart in a rhythm that would respond to a defibrillator . The survival rate was 11 percent for those who got standard CPR mouth to mouth plus chest compressions before an ambulance arrived . The rate was 19 percent for those who got only compressions . The act of keeping oxygen circulating could increase a victim ' s chances of surviving by as much as 70 percent .
