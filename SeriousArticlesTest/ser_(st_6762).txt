Well , he being the only one who s been willing , he s got the guts to wear the issues that need to be spoken about and debate on his sleeve , where the rest of some of these establishment candidates , they just wanted to duck and hide . They didn t want to talk about these issues until he brought them up . In fact , they ve been wearing a , this , um , political correctness kind of like a suicide vest . And enough is enough . These issues that Donald Trump talks about had to be debated . And he brought them to the forefront . And that s why we are where we are today with good discussion . A good , heated , and very competitive primary is where we are . And now though , to be lectured that , well , you guys are all sounding kind of angry , is what we re hearing from the establishment . Doggone right we re angry ! Justifiably so ! Yes ! You know , they stomp on our neck , and then they tell us , Just chill , okay just relax . Well , look , we are mad , and we ve been had . They need to get used to it .
