Ukraine ' s defense ministry has said it has withdrawn from the main terminal at Donetsk airport , but it is doubtful that separatist forces only have that in their sights anyway . After all , although the site holds symbolic value for both sides , it is a hulking ruin and of little strategic relevance . And the leader of DNR , Alexander Zakharchenko , has made clear he believes the borders of his breakaway republic should include the entire Donetsk region , which is double the current territory he controls . Such ambitions are not likely to be realized during the freezing cold of January , but separatist forces are now engaged in combat north of Luhansk and as far south as Mariupol .
