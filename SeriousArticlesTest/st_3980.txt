The crews aboard the four ill fated flights on September 11 all had one expectation at the end of their trip assignments . They would come home to their loved ones , kiss their wife or husband , pet the dog , and listen to their children talk about the day at school . This was the expectation of the crew aboard Malaysia Fight 370 last March , and the crew of Malaysia Flight 17 last week . None of these crews went to work with the expectation that they had the potential to be casualties of war , nor did their passengers .
