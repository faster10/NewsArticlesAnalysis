For residents who can afford to leave , their Palestinian refugee status makes travel very difficult . " Our passports are Syrian Palestinian passports . We can leave Syria , but we can ' t enter Palestine . Even if we could ( leave the camp ) , we cannot go to Turkey without a visa , and Jordan will never let us in . We cannot go to Iraq . To go to Europe , we need visas . We have no embassies in Syria , but Lebanon will not let us in unless we have already a visa ( to somewhere else ) , since we are only allowed a 48 hour transit visa in Lebanon , " Abu Mohammed said .
