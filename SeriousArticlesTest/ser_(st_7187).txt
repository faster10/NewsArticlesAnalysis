Samantha Schroeder of Chester , Maryland " I am the mother of a 19 year old Marine . He joined while still in his senior year . When he came to me to sign his enlistment papers , I was hesitant . No , I was downright , ' Not in a million years . ' He was only 17 . How could I give him permission ? Just wait , I asked , and think about it some more . He looked at me with a mixture of fear in thinking I might not sign and anger in knowing I didn ' t understand . And what he said next has stuck in my head through all his training , and now he leaves in a week for Iraq . He told me , ' Mom , I owe this to my country . ' . . .
