I think that s really the key for us , if we have the player contained he s probably not going to try to run too much , Belichick said . If we don t , then we re vulnerable and he s going to get us . It s having the guy who can make that right decision and really give you that realistic look of , we don t really have it and he hurts us with it , whereas sometimes you re coaching on the film in practice and you re saying , Well if we were playing against this guy and this happened , this is what he s going to do . But we can t really do that so the players never really get that . "
