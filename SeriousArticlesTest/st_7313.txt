Stop meddling in the Middle East : I wish we would get out of the Middle East . It ' s the biggest mess with all that fighting and bickering amongst themselves because they mix religion with government . That ' s what is happening here . It ' s the worst thing you can do . Keep religion out of government . The fighting in the Middle East has been going on for a thousand years . I don ' t know how we think we ' re going to solve anything there .
