' ' Obviously clay is seen as being my worst surface , but I still feel like I play well on that court , ' ' Murray said . ' ' I don ' t know what speed the court ' s going to be . You know , if it ' s quick , then I think that will help my serve a lot . If it ' s slow , then I feel like I can track a lot of balls down on the clay which is positive . I can make it physical and tough that way . ' '
