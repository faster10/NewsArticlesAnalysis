Check out the bullfighting ring . There are so many people stretching their necks to see over the fences that line the streets of Pamplona not to mention sitting on the fences , too that it ' s actually hard to see people and bulls running . " No vamos a ver nada " ( We ' re not going to see anything ) , my friend Marek lamented . We decided to go instead to the Plaza de Toros . With everyone pushing and shoving each other to get tickets to this event , it seemed almost as dangerous as chasing bulls in the streets . But we finally got our passes and made our way inside the enormous arena , which is the ending point of the bull run . There , we watched hundreds of people run around the bulls , including one member of our group who emerged proudly with a large cut or two .
