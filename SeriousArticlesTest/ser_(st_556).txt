Jennings : When I was doing these recordings , I was sending them to a couple of producers to see what they thought of the ideas . Most of the time they were asking me how I recorded this or that and how I got certain sounds . I thought " Maybe this is OK just how it is . " I didn ' t have that one final song that tied it all together , and I was so excited about the idea that I was going to release everything as is and that song just came to me and really hit me hard . It ' s one of my favorite songs . That song feels like something I ' ve been trying to do for years . It captures the feeling I had the whole time I was writing this album .
