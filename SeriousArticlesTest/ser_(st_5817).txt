So , here we go with Casey Austin Keenum . It s hard to believe his quarterback play could be much worse that what the Rams have had . But a lot of his possible success will come from the leadership he ll suddenly need to bring . Does Case Keenum have an aura ? We look at Keenum as the backup , as a last ditch effort to salvage something . But do the offensive players look at him like that ? Or do they feed off his energy , off his confidence , off his mindset that the past is the past and they re prepared for the present ?
