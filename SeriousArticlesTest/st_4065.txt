However , we also hear stories of Light . Recently a little girl from Schenectady , New York survived a fire in an apartment building . Sadly , her father and three siblings were killed . She created a video asking for one thing this holiday season : a few Christmas cards to fill her Christmas Card Tree . With that simple request , she has received hundreds of thousands of cards from total strangers . On our college campus , our students , mostly through student clubs , take on numerous projects each year to provide assistance to people in our community , people they don ' t even know , but want to help . We are at our best when we help a stranger through a difficult time .
