And therein lies an opportunity for us as a hospitality company to play an active role in the educational process . For instance , Chinese guests staying at our Conrad Maldives Rangali Island resort are fascinated with the coral formations around the resort , and sometimes try to bring a piece back as a souvenir . Our resort team members receive cultural training that enables them to then educate their Chinese guests on the length of time coral takes to form and the fragility of the formations , and hence the importance of leaving them in their natural state .
