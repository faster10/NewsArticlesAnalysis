Mazzara : Greg Nicotero is our zombie king . He actually runs a zombie school , where he brings in extras and actors , where he teaches them all about zombies . Depending on how they do , he positions them in the shot . The better zombies get more makeup and are more up front . Those zombies who are not as scary , they ' re more in the back of the shots or the edge of the frames . What ' s great about Greg is when the writers have questions like " would a zombie do this ? " and we call Greg and talk through a lot of zombie science and zombie law . He ' s our resident expert .
