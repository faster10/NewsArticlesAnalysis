Disoriented and blinded by the pepper spray , I remained standing until I was kicked in the knee and forced to the ground . I did not completely relax one of my arms as it was twisted behind me , so I was tasered in the back of my ribs repeatedly , eventually handcuffed , left to lie in the street for several minutes , then arrested and hauled off to jail , and charged with impeding police . The six others were similarly charged and it all began with a joke .
