He explained : " The fact that New England panics every time there is a flurry is due to lack of preparedness at the infrastructure level . In most of Norway , power and telephone lines are underground , it is illegal not to have snow tires on your car after December 1st or thereabouts ( if you go in the ditch , you are fined ) and during my own and my children ' s school days we have never had a snow day or any other interruption due to the weather ( and we have plenty of weather ) . I have never been to the store to stock up on batteries and water . . . . Our airport does not close down for snow , though there can be delays . "
