Many neon sign aficionados would tell you that New York ' s best neon signs went up in the 1930s , and I agree . Sign designers really created some beautiful and unique works in the years before World War II . After the War , storefront signs in New York tended to become less inventive , while signs for Route 66 type motels and drive ins became more flamboyant . This happened partly because of rising labor costs in New York , and partly because of a general shift in emphasis from old urban centers to roadside and suburban development during this period .
