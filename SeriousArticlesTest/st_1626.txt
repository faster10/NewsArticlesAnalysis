" People who are working a lot and not getting enough sleep often reach for that extra cup of coffee because they think it ' s going to help them . But in reality the caffeine makes things much worse , " says Marjorie Nolan , a registered dietitian . " When you ' re anxious and stressed out , your body is already stimulated . Add caffeine , which is a stimulant , on top of that , and you ' re setting yourself up to crash and burn a few hours later . Plus , you ' re dehydrating yourself , which makes you feel even more fatigued and stressed . You also end up depleting valuable hormones in the long run . "
