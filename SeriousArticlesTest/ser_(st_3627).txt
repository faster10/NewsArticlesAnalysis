Rihanna has certainly earned the right to set the rules at this point in her career . She is one of the most successful female solo artists in history , with as many No . 1 singles to her name as Michael Jackson . She s also been one of pop s most influential figures , helping usher electronic dance music ( EDM ) into the mainstream and boosting the careers of another class of pop stars with her leftovers ? Rihanna had first pass at Selena Gomez s Same Old Love and Miley Cyrus hip hop coming out party , We Can t Stop . If you wanted to be a pop star in the past few years , sounding like Rihanna was evidently your best bet , even if it was hard to keep up with Rihanna s mercurial mix of dance music , hip hop and Caribbean inspired pop .
