Torture is not a new phenomenon to us but I didn ' t realize how widespread and vile it is . When one of his fellow inmates was released he came to visit us and told us that the prison he was in was a hell hole . Forty men are crammed in an extremely small room , stripped naked except for underwear and forbidden from showering . He said every day a ruthless commander would come in and call few names then declare : " Come with me to be executed . " This was enough to keep every one of these men on edge every night .
