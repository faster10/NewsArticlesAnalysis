Again , it ' s not just nostalgic , but connected to the movies . The park ' s icon has changed from Grizzly Peak ( a man made mountain in the shape of a Grizzly Bear , California ' s state animal ) to the Carthay Circle Theater , the theater where " Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs " debuted in 1937 .
