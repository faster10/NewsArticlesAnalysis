TEMPLON : Yeah . So I read in a statistics paper that about 1 percent of tennis matches were fixed , and I started looking on my own at different data to see if we could find suspicious trends in tennis matches . And so what I did is , I took those 26 , 000 tennis matches between 2009 and 2015 and looked at the movements in pre match betting odds , and we looked for when those matches went against players and how often they lost . And for 15 players , we found interesting trends where it would happen less than 5 times in a 100 . And then for four players in particular , we found that those trends , if the opening odds were correct , would occur less than 1 in 1 , 000 times . And so those were really suspicious , and we wanted to look more into them . And so then we started doing the deep document dive in the investigative reporting .
