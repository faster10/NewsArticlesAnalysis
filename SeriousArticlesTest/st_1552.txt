It s critical that media outlets resist any further attempts by the GOP to meddle with upcoming debates . To state the obvious : Political parties should stay well away from the journalistic process . It shouldn t be up to them what kinds of questions get asked , or how the moderators handle their time constraints , or who gets to speak and when . There has to be some real independent scrutiny of these candidates , and you can t get that when the parties are stacking the deck . If the networks cave , they ll be setting a dangerous precedent and ensuring that the debates be even more of a joke than they already are .
