Positioned on stage between Trump and Bush , Rubio performed a deft piece of political ju jitsu , turning Bush ' s attack against him and suggesting that the former Florida governor ? is a puppet of his advisers . Bush ? never made an issue of ? U . S . Senator John McCain ' s absenteeism when the Arizonan was running for president in 2008 , Rubio said . The only reason you re doing it now is because we re running for the same position , and someone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you , he added , ? earning applause from the audience . My campaign is going to be about the future of America , it s not going to be about attacking anyone else on the stage .
