If they are serious about eradicating match fixing , they might also grant extra cash to the Tennis Integrity Unit they are so proud about . The TIU is , alas , as opaque as it is poorly supported , employing as it does only two full time investigators . As such , it tends to mete out dubiously draconian punishments as a smokescreen for acting tough . While it is fashionable to denounce Austria s Daniel K ? llerer ? the one player known to have been banned for fixing ? can anybody state with confidence that he had a fair hearing , when there was scant hard evidence and two witnesses were discredited ?
