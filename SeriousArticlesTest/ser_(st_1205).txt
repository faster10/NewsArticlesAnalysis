Bush is correct that Trump ' s campaign of insults has made the 2016 GOP primary race an ugly affair . But his response suggesting he ' d take his ball and go home rather than sully himself is precisely what has sunk Bush ' s candidacy so far . Angry voters want a fighter , and Bush , justifiably dubbed " low energy " by Trump , doesn ' t seem to have it in him . The way to combat Trump ' s demagoguery and race baiting is not to look down your nose at him and say " Tut tut . " It ' s to hit Trump back with as much force as he delivers .
