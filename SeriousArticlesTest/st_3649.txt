Lincoln , Disney ' s much buzzed about Oscar contender , fared well in its expansion from 11 theaters into 1 , 775 locations , grossing 21 . 0 million over the Friday to Sunday period . Lincoln opened slightly higher than fellow Oscar front runner Argo , which kicked off its run with 19 . 8 million last month ( and now has 92 . 0 million total ) . Thanks to strong reviews and an " A " CinemaScore grade from audiences , 64 percent of which were 50 or older , the 65 million Steven Spielberg directed film should hold up just as well especially because older patrons typically take their time in coming out to the theater , and the upcoming holidays frees up many working adults ' schedules to go to the movies . Spielberg ' s last film , War Horse , which was less well received , galloped all the way to 79 . 9 million over the holidays after a 7 . 5 million opening weekend . With awards season right around the corner , Lincoln could make it to 100 million with ease .
