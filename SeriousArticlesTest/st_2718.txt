Veterans simply want what they were promised in the Choice Act : the choice to access the care they deserve in their community . In my hometown of Hays , Kansas , a veteran is forced to drive 200 miles several times a month for routine cortisone shots because the VA outpatient clinic just 25 miles from his home does not offer the shots he needs . One would think this veteran could use his Choice Card to visit a local physician or local hospital to get the shots he needs but the VA is denying access to this care . Thousands of veterans across the country are facing this same frustration .
