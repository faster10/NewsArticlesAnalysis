De Waal : Well , that ' s a good question . I ' m struggling with that . I ' m personally a nonbeliever , so I ' m struggling with if we really need religion . . . . I ' m from the Netherlands , where 60 of the people are nonbelievers . So in northern Europe , there are actually experiments going on now with societies that are more secular , to see if we can maintain a moral society that way , and for the moment I would say that experiment is going pretty well . . . . Personally I think it is possible to build a society that is moral on a nonreligious basis , but the jury is still out on that .
