Recap : The 49ers jumped to a 20 0 halftime lead and then held on to complete a remarkable transformation to a Super Bowl champion that lost only three times all season . Coach Bill Walsh , in his third season , beat the team that denied him the head coaching job and instead hired Bill Johnson after Paul Brown retired . Quarterback Joe Montana ( 14 of 22 , 157 yards , 1 TD ) was near perfect in the first half , leading the 49ers on three long scoring drives . Montana scored on a 1 yard run , threw an 11 yard touchdown pass to Earl Cooper , and Ray Wersching kicked four field goals to account for the scoring . Cincinnati turned the ball over four times , but the biggest sequence of the second half came when the 49ers turned back 250 pound fullback Pete Johnson on fourth and 1 from the 1 yard line . Included in the goal line stand was a second and 1 stop by Jack " Hacksaw " Reynolds and a remarkable open field tackle by linebacker Dan Bunz on a swing pass from Ken Anderson to Charles Alexander at the 1 . On fourth down , Johnson couldn ' t budge the middle of the 49ers ' line .
