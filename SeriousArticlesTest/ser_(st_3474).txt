Down at Jackson Square , with the iconic cathedral rising beside us , I hop onto a buggy with Willie Pickett , and his mule , Pierre , pulls us into the steady stream of tourists he relies on for fares all day . I ask him what he wants them to know about the city he grew up in . " I want them to know that we love them and we want them to keep coming back . And everything they like and love about New Orleans is just like it was before Katrina . "
