" Currently , the thousands of Muslim staff and students ( within Montgomery County Public Schools ) have to choose between their education and observing their religious practices , " says a statement on the website of the Equality for Eid Coalition , which has been advocating for Montgomery County to close school on Muslim holidays . " They either skip school ( an excused absence ) to celebrate Eids or they skip their religious observances to attend school . Many choose to do the latter . However , this is not a choice that , for the most part , our Christian and Jewish neighbors face on their high holidays . "
