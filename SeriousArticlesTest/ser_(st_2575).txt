We have become used to the fact that very little in the world of athletics or cycling is as it seems , while football , snooker and cricket ? games which attract an inordinate amount of gambling ? have lived through their own match fixing scandals . Sport may be a glorious irrelevance , but it matters to people way beyond any tribal or partisan allegiance . At its best , it is an art form . Who can say there isn t anything poetic about Lionel Messi ? Or Roger Federer ? Sport can define cultural and national identity . It can give meaning to lives that have none . At the heart of it all , however , is trust , the trust that everything you see , every game you play , every contest you have , is real . Once that is taken away , there is hardly anything left to believe in . ?
