It is against the law to remove classification markings from classified information and enter it into an unclassified system ? which is the only way this information could have found its way into more than 1 , 300 emails on Clinton ' s personal server . There is no way to accidentally send classified information by unclassified email . Senior officials have separate computers in their offices for classified and unclassified information . The two systems are not connected . The only way information from the classified system can make it onto an unclassified system is for someone to intentionally put it there ? either by taking a document that is marked classified and typing the information without markings into an unclassified email , or by putting a thumb drive into their classified computer , downloading information and then putting that thumb drive into an unclassified computer , as Edward Snowden did . In either case , it is a crime .
