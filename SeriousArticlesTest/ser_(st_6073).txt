Did you know that 40 percent of the food supply in America is thrown away ? According to the NRDC , this amounts to 165 billion each year . Some food never leaves the farm , other food is thrown away since it is ' not appealing ' enough for grocery store customers , and more gets thrown away by restaurants . About half of the 40 percent is thrown away by American families , which may cost the average family between 1365 and 2275 a year , according to the Washington Post .
