If you can ' t see it , how did scientists find evidence of dark matter ? One clear sign appeared in astronomical images taken in the 1980s , with photographic plates and new more sensitive detectors , that showed a really odd phenomenon : strange , long arcs of faint blue light behind groups of redder , rounder galaxies . At first , the arcs were dismissed as anomalies . They were like the Bigfoot of the sky : too odd to explain based on current knowledge , but not clear enough to claim a new species .
