We have in place both the technical and legal capabilities to prohibit the widespread dissemination of hate based propaganda disguised as religious teaching . We can monitor social media by expanding the search algorithms already in place to safeguard against inappropriate behavior , including religious hate speech . Once flagged , we can notify platform providers and encourage them to censor communications ( and block users ) that violate the terms of constructive discourse . The hacker group Anonymous has already provided a model for accomplishing this . We should use every tool at our disposal to root out and destroy the global online recruitment efforts of these extremist organizations . We must not allow their macabre murder videos and threats to be promoted anywhere .
