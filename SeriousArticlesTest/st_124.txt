From an early age , I remember health awareness campaigns around my home in S ? o Paulo , Brazil . They taught us how to avoid Aedis aegypti mosquitoes and what to do if we had dengue fever symptoms : don t leave any still water outside , that s where Aedis aegypti put their eggs and if you have a fever during summer , make your way to a doctor to get tested immediately . If caught early on , dengue can be treated and everything will be fine .
