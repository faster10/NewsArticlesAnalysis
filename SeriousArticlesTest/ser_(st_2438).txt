Thomas said that as soon as computer messages started telling the squadron commanders at Warren Air Force Base that a problem existed over the weekend , closed circuit television security cameras were used to check each silo and make sure no obvious problems existed . Then , Air Force personnel from Warren were sent to all 50 silos , in a " not insignificant effort , " to visually inspect them and make sure they were secure . Some of the missile silos are hundreds of miles from the base .
