Nimmo has been reincarnated , and replaced on the show , by the versatile good egg Gyles Brandreth . Gyles can talk about ' the things in my wallet ' until the cows come home . Indeed , he holds the Guinness World Record for making a 12 hour non stop speech . He wore a surgical appliance so that he could urinate at the podium . I was fascinated to be told in this book that ' the Duke of Edinburgh has one ' . Keep that in mind when you next see him taking the salute .
