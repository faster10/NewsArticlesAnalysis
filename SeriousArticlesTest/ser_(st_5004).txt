" Our immediate objective over the next few months is to improve the Wii U system and make it a little more stable , a little bit more convenient to use from a system standpoint , " Miyamoto said . " Miiverse ( a sort of social network that lets players interact ) is an example of an ongoing project . We really wanted to be able to leverage Miiverse in something like ' New Super Mario Bros . U . ' We ' re obviously still early on in it and just trying things out , but so far , it does feel like the community itself is doing a very good job of being a warm and welcoming place for people .
