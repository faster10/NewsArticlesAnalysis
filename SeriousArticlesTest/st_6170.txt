On Nov . 26 , we celebrate Thanksgiving . It will be a day marked by parades with marching bands , floats and balloons , by football games from morning until late evening , by amounts of food and drink that surpass our capacity to consume , and by the beginning of a month long marketing blitz seeking our consumer dollar . While we enjoy the camaraderie and festivities of the day , do not forget its central purpose ? to thank God for His innumerable blessings on us , our families and our nation . What an expression of faith it would be if everyone could begin the day with an act of recognition of God , attend a church service , say more than a superficial prayer , and perhaps , just perhaps , decline that extra piece of pie .
