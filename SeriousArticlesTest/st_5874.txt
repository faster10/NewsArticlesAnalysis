Morello : My parents met in Kenya . My father is African , is Kenyan . The Kenyan side of my family was involved in the anticolonial movement . My great uncle was Jomo Kenyatta , Kenya ' s first president , who led the movement to oust the British from Kenya . I didn ' t grow up with my Kenyan family . I grew up in a small , conservative suburb of Chicago . The song " Facing Mount Kenya " explores the pride in that country and the distance from it as well .
