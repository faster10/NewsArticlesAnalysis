One of the many Achilles ' heels for the Jets defense this season has been defending running backs in the passing game . They ' ve consistently given up big plays to opposing backs out of the backfield , and it won ' t get any easier with Shane Vereen on the other side . When in man coverage , the Jets have to ensure Vereen and the Giants ' running backs don ' t get behind the defense and beat them for a big play . Zone coverage makes defending wheel routes much easier .
