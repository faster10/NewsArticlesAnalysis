Wawrinka advances : Following Roger Federer s 300th victory in grand slams on day five and Maria Sharapova s 600th on tour , Wawrinka notched his 400th career win with a triumph over Czech Lukas Rosol 6 2 6 3 7 6 ( 3 ) . The Swiss fourth seed has been battling a cold at Melbourne Park but his game was in rude health as he smashed 18 aces and 45 winners in the late afternoon sunshine at Rod Laver Arena . As long as I m feeling good on the court , that s the most important thing , a raspy voiced Wawrinka said . The 30 year old Swiss must next weather the serving storm of Canadian dark horse Milos Raonic , who despatched Serb Viktor Troicki 6 2 6 3 6 4 at the Margaret Court Arena . A quarter finalist last year , 13th seed Raonic dedicated his win to victims of a school shooting in the remote Canadian town of La Loche , where four people were killed and a number injured on Friday . Stuff like this doesn t happen much back home , he told reporters . I m sure not just in that small community but throughout Canada it was a lot of people that were sort of heartbroken over it .
