It is because of all of this that when I think of what it means to be poor in this country , I don ' t see a bunch of parasites looking for tax subsidized handouts . I see hardworking people who could use a helping hand . I see my mother , who to this day shops at the Goodwill , even though her children can now buy her clothes whenever she wants . None of us is rich , but we are the fruit of her years of nonstop labor and inherited the work ethic we saw all around us . And if you scan through the biographies of some of this nation ' s greatest success stories across every conceivable demographic , you will find people with humble beginnings like mine . Perhaps you yourself came from little .
