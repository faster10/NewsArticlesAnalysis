Davis finished the 2015 regular season with a 0 . 94 ERA and has yet to allow an earned run this postseason . He entered the hearts of Royals fans forever with his performance Friday in Game 6 against the Blue Jays . After fellow reliever Ryan Madson gave up a two run homer that tied the game in the eighth , Davis not only stopped the bleeding that inning but returned for the ninth after a 45 minute rain delay and tossed a scoreless inning that included escaping a two on , no out jam . The Royals , of course , went on to win .
