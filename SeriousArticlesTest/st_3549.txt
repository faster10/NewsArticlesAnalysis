Here ' s what the EPA did after that happened : It put out a press release referring to Del Toral ' s data as " initial results " that other officials would need to " verify and assess . " ? Hedman , the regional EPA boss , told the mayor of Flint in a private email that the preliminary draft report should not have been released outside the agency . " At the same time , Michigan state government spokesperson Brad Wurfel said that " anyone who is concerned about lead in the drinking water in Flint can relax " Wurfel , who has since resigned , also later called Del Toral a " rogue employee . " ? The EPA didn ' t say anything further to defend its own analysis ? which , as it turns out , was completely correct . ?
