Telling me to " man up " or not be a " pussy " tells me that you believe women are weaker , more emotional and lesser than a man . It tells me that you think a certain way to act is the right way and anything that does not fall under the umbrella of " acceptable " behavior or emotions is something to be put down . This attitude , that there is a correct way to have courage , be successful , or achieve happiness , is something that I believe hurts everyone in our society , including myself .
