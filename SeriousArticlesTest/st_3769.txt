I ' ve also been interested in the case in Italy with the American on trial for murder . That is intriguing from a forensic standpoint because I think all of us would like to know more about the evidence and what ' s there to piece together that could tell us what happened . I ' m afraid that because of how much time has passed and how the case was handled that a lot of the answers are gone and the kind of evidence that was collected could have been handled differently ,
