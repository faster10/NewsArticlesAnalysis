As Mikey Dickerson , a founding member of the agency and part of the healthcare . gov team , said , a key element is to make it possible for people who had been part of the problem in the past to change . You have to give them permission to come along and get on the bandwagon . If they get convinced there won t be any place for them in the new world , then ( they will ) dig in and resist what you re doing . You have to be willing to make friends with people you might not have otherwise thought .
