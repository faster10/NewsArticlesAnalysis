Zika , a virus that causes mild fever , rash , pink eye and joint pain in one in five people it infects , has emerged as the newest threat to pregnant women and their unborn babies . Though there is no conclusive evidence that Zika causes microcephaly , a congenital defect that results in babies being born with small heads and brain damage , but circumstantial evidence indicates it does . Scientists in Brazil , where close to 4 , 000 babies have been born with microcephaly since the Zika outbreak started a year ago , have found that the virus can cross from the infected mother to the baby through the placenta . Before 2015 , Brazil had less than 20 cases of microcephaly each year .
