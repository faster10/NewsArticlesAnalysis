Bowie s creative impulses never wavered either , whether he was teaming up with Nile Rodgers for the hit album Let s Dance or pursuing film roles like his memorable turn as Jareth the Goblin King in 1986 s Labyrinth . I ve always called him the Picasso of rock roll , Rodgers tells EW . We were doing Let s Dance , and one day he came to my apartment and he was sort of hiding something behind his back . And he says , Nile , darling , I want the album to sound like this . And he whipped out a picture of Little Richard in a red suit getting into a red Cadillac convertible . I knew exactly what he was talking about .
