Another problem for Republicans who claim to want to simplify the tax code : Middle class Americans really like their tax loopholes , or at least have organized their life plans around them . They see the mortgage interest rate deduction as the only way of affording a mortgage payment . They see the loophole that their employer uses to compensate them in a health insurance plan as the only way to provide good health care to their families . They see the state income tax deduction as the only thing that makes living in high tax states remotely affordable . And so on .
