Unfortunately , we aren ' t getting anywhere near this experience with Kobe , and haven ' t really seen good play out of him since before his Achilles ' tendon ruptured in 2013 . That ' s not to knock what Bryant has done , and is still trying to do , and the comparisons to Michael Jordan with him are always a bit tricky . One sect of NBA fans who adore Kobe pine for him to be put in the same light as Jordan maybe even as the improved , more modern version . It ' s simply not the case , but listen , it ' s not a bad thing to become the gatekeeper to that standard . That isn ' t failure .
