Prime Minister Justin Trudeau : ? Oh I think , I think first of all the outpouring of support that I ' ve seen from people I talk to , from community leaders , riding associations , mayors and the premiers I ' ve talked with at our first ministers meeting , everyone is very , very positive about it . They just want to be reassured it ' s being done right and that has been our overarching goal on this . But people have to understand at the same time this is not about government sort of signing a paper and bringing over 25 , 000 refugees . This is going to have to be a whole of Canada effort . Communities , provinces , cities engaging in making sure that these people aren ' t just welcomed when they get here , but are given paths towards successful contributions . ? ? ? ? ? ?
