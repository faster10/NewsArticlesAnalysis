Just down the road in Oxford Circus is Tiwani Contemporary , a gallery that specializes in Nigerian art , also run by a woman , this time Maria Varnava who spent her childhood in West Africa .

It would appear that women are at the vanguard of raising the profile of contemporary African art . And for those who may point out that three female curators do not a trend make , name checks to Chief Nike Okundaye , Touria El Glaoui and Rakeb Sile to list a few .
