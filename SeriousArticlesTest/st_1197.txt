But the Mets have to do it themselves . They can ' t rely on what happened in 1986 or last year . If they go down in this series , the 2015 Mets will be remembered as ? a team that exceeded expecations and made it to the World Series a year ahead of schedule . But that will be all they will be remembered for . The winners , the guys who pop the champagne are the ones who live on forever in baseball lore . The 2015 Mets still have a chance to do what the 1986 Mets did of course , they still have a shot to do what the 2000 Mets did .
