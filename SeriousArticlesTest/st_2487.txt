I was talking to this one trans girl . She said that about two years after she transitioned and was living authentically as being female , and working , and being out there , she jumped into bed one night and actually thought , Wait a second , I went my whole day and never once thought about gender . She said it was a real milestone for her . She lay there in bed and started crying . I would love to get to that point in my life , you know ? I m not there yet . But I would love to get there . I just want to get up in the morning , be myself , enjoy my day , have loving people around me .
