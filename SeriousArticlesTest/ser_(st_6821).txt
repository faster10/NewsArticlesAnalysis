" The goal was to try and make a film that would bring this cast together by time travel or time displacement of some kind , " Singer said . " Basically , the notion is that consciousness of Wolverine of the future is sent into his past self . And it was nice because Hugh was able to play both parts because the character of Wolverine is ageless . And it was great to be able to place him as a character in both these worlds . For me , it was great to reunite the old cast and get to work as a director with the new cast . "
