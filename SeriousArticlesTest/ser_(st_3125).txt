And , saving the first for last , there is the scene setter , the title track , Blackstar . Here Bowie seems to me to be locating his place in the firmament . It begins with a ceremonial sounding , Eastern inflected chant about the center of it all and later moves into a minor key funk refrain in which he invokes the myriad possible faces and modes of fame and transcendence : I m a blackstar , I m not a film star I m not a porn star I m not a white star I m not a wandering star I m not a gangstar .
