" I broke the ( grand slam ) record when I was 29 I went through the next two years trying to find motivation . I just felt week in week out I didn ' t have it in me anymore , I just wanted to win one more major . I switched coaches , didn ' t really work out very well with that . I went back to Paul Annacone over the summer , and I just knew I had the game , I just needed to put it together and play that last U . S . Open .
