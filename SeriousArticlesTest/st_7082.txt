So I forged ahead with my wine , my cheese , my socks and my ninja book in tow . I watched steam come off people ' s heads as they left the Metropolitan Rec Center , an indoor public pool . In addition to the rec center , Williamsburg has decently maintained baseball fields , tennis and bocce courts and a handsome track , the sort of public amenities that many towns can only dream about . They ' re well maintained remnants of a more optimistic time in America . Again , oddly wonderful for an outsider to see .
