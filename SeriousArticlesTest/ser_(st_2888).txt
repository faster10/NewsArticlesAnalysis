What would happen if the Tar Heels win : We would have a new No . 1 team , and a free for all debate among as many as four or five competing interests for theoretically the fourth spot in the playoff . North Carolina itself would have an argument , at 12 1 and owning a league championship and the only victory over Clemson . ( Just don t ask about those two FCS opponents in September . ) Ohio State ( 11 1 ) would jump back into the fray . So would Stanford , if it beats USC on Saturday to win the Pac 12 . Loser of the Big Ten championship game could make an appeal for consideration as well .
