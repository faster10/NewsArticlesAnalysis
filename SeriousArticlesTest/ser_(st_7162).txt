While on Hajj , Muslim pilgrims travel great distances to Mecca , Saudi Arabia , during the last month of the Islamic calendar , which is tied to the lunar calendar . At Mecca , nestled among the mountains and deserts of the western part of the country , lies the Sacred Mosque . This is the spiritual epicenter of Islam and the location of the Kaaba , the first Islamic house of worship , built by the patriarch Abraham and his son Ishmael . When Muslims orient themselves to Mecca for their five daily prayers , they are praying in the direction of the Kaaba .
