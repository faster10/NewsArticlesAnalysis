Moving on : It seems like in your case , you don ' t have that many degrees of separation between you and your bus boy . You attend the same school , take public transportation ( i . e . you ' re poor ) and are not , in fact , Luddites . In this case , I say : Be bold . You found him on Google , you say ? If you found his Facebook profile ( and not some old swim meet records from middle school ) , go ahead and send him a brief message ( " Hope your meeting on the downtown campus went off without a hitch ! " ) and a friend request .
