People think , She s just a rich kid . Until I was 18 , I was . Then I was broke . I ve never taken a dime off my parents . I m completely self made . I went to UC Santa Barbara , and when I quit to try to be an actress , my dad was like , That s great , but I m not gonna help you So I got an apartment with a roommate I worked as a hostess at a restaurant I would scrounge quarters to buy Starbucks ? and walk there to save gas . I remember once asking my dad for money , like , Please , I m really stuck . Can you help ? And he said , You re more than welcome to come over for dinner . That was it , she recalled . Those were the days . Enough to know the value of money .
