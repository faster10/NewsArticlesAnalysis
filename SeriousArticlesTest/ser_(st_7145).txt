Squibb : The cemetery is the first scene that I shot . When I found that out , I screamed , " Alexander ! This is hard ! " And he said , " No , we ' re doing it first , and it ' ll be fine . " And of course it was . We had a good time and it was fun to shoot . I think he got what he wanted from it . The first day on set is always a little nervous making , no matter how much you ' ve worked or who you worked with .
