ABOUT THE COWBOYS ( 2 7 ) : Dallas won its first two games with Romo under center before going into a swoon , and the veteran quarterback saw some positives from his team while he was out . I m really inspired by the way they just committed every week , Romo told reporters . And obviously the results weren t exactly the way they wanted or anything , but I think when you watch how they play , I think it gives us a great opportunity to still go out and accomplish the goals . The Cowboys released Weeden this week because of Romo s impending return , and Cassel will serve as the backup .
