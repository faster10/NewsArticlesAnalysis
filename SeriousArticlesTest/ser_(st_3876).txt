Brian Regan : This isn ' t the main reason , but when I was in college Heidelberg College in Ohio , my name was Rip for Rip van Winkle . I had a 7 a . m . class , and I missed it almost every day . I would wake up and run across campus . I remember thinking , " What ' s going to happen if I don ' t wake up for things ? " And then a comedian performed at our college , and I went to the show , and I noticed the show started at 8 p . m . and I was like , well , the hours are good . I can handle a job that starts at 8 p . m .
