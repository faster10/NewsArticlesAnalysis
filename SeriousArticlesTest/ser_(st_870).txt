That gives us a main stage debate consisting of Donald Trump , Ben Carson , Marco Rubio , Ted Cruz , Jeb Bush , Carly Fiorina , John Kasich , and Rand Paul . The undercard debate will consist of Huckabee , Christie , Bobby Jindal and Rick Santorum . I noted earlier today that ? Christie probably wouldn t make the cut for the main stage , but Huckabee s failure to make the stage depended on which of the five most recent polls Fox used to determine eligibility . Obviously , he didn t fare well in their selection . As for the undercard debate , Pataki , Graham , and Gilmore failed to make the cut because they failed to register even one percent support in any of those polls .
