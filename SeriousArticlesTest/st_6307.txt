Roy Hibbert produced seven points , eight boards and four blocks , but I m curious to see if he can keep it up over the course of an 82 game season like he hasn t been able to do in recent years . D Angelo Russell is slowly starting to figure out how to play in the NBA and had another nice outing on Sunday , scoring 13 points with nine rebounds , six assists and two treys . He did tweak his ankle in the third quarter , but he played through and it doesn t sound serious . I m not ready to trust Russell as a starter in standard leagues yet , but he s making progress . Jordan Clarkson added 19 points on 8 of 14 shooting with three 3 pointers , four rebounds and one assist , while Lou Williams added 14 points and five boards off the bench .
