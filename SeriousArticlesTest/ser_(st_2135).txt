About 3 a . m . , I remembered seeing a website where you can superimpose pictures of a fairy on a photo of your sleeping child . Knowing that nothing would traumatize my youngest daughter more than a visual of an otherworldly creature walking on her face while she lay unconscious , I took a photo of a windowsill upstairs instead . For the low price of 7 , I added what looked like a crouching Barbie doll wearing a cheap prom dress and wings . As I lay in bed , I created an elaborate backstory of how I ' d managed to take the photo with my iPhone right before she spit in my face for scaring her .
