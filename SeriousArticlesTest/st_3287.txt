Prior to the technological revolution in U . S . energy production , 81 percent of the world ' s proven oil reserves were located in OPEC member countries , with the bulk of OPEC oil reserves in the Middle East , amounting to 66 percent of the OPEC total . But things change we have seen a 75 percent increase in reserves in the U . S . since 2008 . Even more important , the Energy Information Administration estimates U . S . undiscovered , technically recoverable oil resources to be an additional 198 billion barrels . Yes , we are bigger than Saudi Arabia !
