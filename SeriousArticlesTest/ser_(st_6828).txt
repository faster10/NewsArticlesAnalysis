" I love seeing a weight loss story like this one that focuses on healthy eating and exercising , " Jacqueline Mayse said . " My husband and I both decided to start losing weight this past January and it really helps to have each other for support and motivation . We have both lost almost 20 pounds so far and our goals are 40 to 50 pounds total . People keep asking us ' What are you doing to lose weight ? ! ' and seem a bit disappointed when we tell them calorie counting and exercise . Haha . You ' re an inspiration ! "
