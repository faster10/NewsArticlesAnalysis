Take care of cats and dogs : Hurray , they passed a law starting Jan . 1 that makes it illegal to leave your dog outside in the freezing cold . How sad it is that they have to pass a law to have this done when human compassion should make you bring your dog into a warm house . It makes me wonder why you got a dog in the first place if you leave it out in the cold . A dog or a cat is supposed to be an addition to your family and not something shut out in your backyard . If you are not going to treat your pet right , don ' t get one at all .
