On Friday , facing further criticism , LePage held a news conference to discuss and defend his comments . I spent an hour and 15 minutes talking to the people in Richmond the other night about some of the problems in Maine , LePage said . In that whole time , many of you were there , that whole time , I made one slip up , I made one word of slip up . I may have made many slip ups . I was going impromptu , and my brain didn t catch up to my mouth . He continued : If I slipped up and used the wrong word , I apologize to all the Maine women . And when asked if he would apologize to Maine s black community , LePage said , I never said anything about white or black on traffickers .
