There are a few arguments in favor of the country staying within the EU . One is that the U . K . will still be affected by EU rules , but without having influence on them . Its exporters will still have to abide by EU product rules , for example . The U . K . will have to negotiate trade deals on its own , rather than as part of the EU bloc , which has the biggest GDP of any economic bloc on Earth . And many darkly warn that countless companies and jobs would leave the country if it stopped being part of the EU .
