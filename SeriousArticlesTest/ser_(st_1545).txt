Smaug notched the fourth best December opening weekend ever , after An Unexpected Journey , I Am Legend ( 77 . 2 million ) , and Avatar ( 77 million ) , and although it undercut its predecessor ' s debut , Warner Bros . , who co financed the film with MGM for about 225 million , can ' t be too disappointed with the result . The first Hobbit film finished with 303 million domestically and over 1 billion worldwide . Even if Smaug can ' t match those figures ( if it plays like Journey , it ' s headed for 263 million domestically ) , it will be a hugely profitable venture for the studio .
