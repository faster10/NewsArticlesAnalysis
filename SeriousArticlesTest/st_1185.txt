Just think : A few hours before Rubio was to deliver a message reflecting a new Republican Party , he casts a vote that screams more of the same . The jokes about him fidgeting like a 5 year old and chugging water during the rebuttal will eventually go away . But if he ' s seriously thinking about running in 2016 , that one vote is going to come back to haunt him . Especially if a revitalized Hillary Clinton , and her 18 million cracks in the ceiling , is in the race .
