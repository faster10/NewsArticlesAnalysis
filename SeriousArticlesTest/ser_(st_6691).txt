I m fiercely proud of that young lady , Platt tells EW . I was proud of her anyway for the performance she gave , but to come in on Sunday morning and share with me the news she s a very determined young woman . She felt that her father would want her to perform , and she s a professional and she knows that the show has to go on , as any actor of the theater or in a live event knows . So she decided she would take her feelings of loss and sadness and put them in a box for that afternoon , that she would use them to fuel her performance and she would do it in honor of her father .
