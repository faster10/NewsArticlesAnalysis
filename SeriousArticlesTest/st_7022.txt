It seems like it sends the message that this Pope really cares about the poor . It ' s like , let me go to the place where the world is not even looking and help put it on the map . And that fits with the message he ' s been delivering since he assumed the papacy . Early on , he basically said , let ' s stop talking so much about abortion ? not that it ' s not important , but it ' s maybe not the thing pastors should be preaching about every Sunday . There are other issues , like poverty .
