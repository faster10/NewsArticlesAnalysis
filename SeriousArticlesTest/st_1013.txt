How close was Emmanuel Sanders to becoming a Patriot three years ago ? About eight hours , he said . The Patriots signed Sanders to a one year , 2 . 5 million offer sheet in April 2013 after he caught 44 passes for 626 yards and a touchdown with the Steelers . If the Steelers didn t match the offer , the Patriots would have had to give up a third round pick in exchange for Sanders , but the Steelers matched the offer just before the deadline . Sanders had no problems going back and playing opposite Antonio Brown , he said , but that was his last season in Pittsburgh . He signed a three year , 15 million deal with the Broncos in 2014 and he s been one of the league s top receivers ever since . It all worked out for the best , Sanders said . ? . ? . Former Broncos Terrell Davis , John Lynch , and Steve Atwater will be honorary captains for Sunday s game . Kubiak played with Atwater and coached Davis and Lynch . They re great players , great Broncos , great players in this league but great people , Kubiak said . So it ll be a special day all around and having them with us to start , that d be pretty cool .
