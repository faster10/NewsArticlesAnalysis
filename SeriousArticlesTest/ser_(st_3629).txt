And , boy , how Anti gives Rihanna room grow : the last time Rihanna took more than a year to put out a big artistic statement , it was for 2009 s Rated R . But looking back , what seemed out of left field for her then plays like a darker twist on what she was already doing . Now , on Anti , Rihanna further indulges her personal tastes , which are perhaps more alternative than anyone realized , with distorted guitars , gurgling bass parts and a cover of Australian psych rock group Tame Impala s New Person , Same Old Mistakes . ( Calling it a cover might be a little generous ? she sings over the band s original instrumental from last year without much interpretation . )
