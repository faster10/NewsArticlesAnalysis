De Waal : Yeah , my view is that you have two ( kinds of ) people in the world . You have people who think that we are inherently bad and evil and selfish , but with a lot of hard work we can be good , and you have other people like myself who believe that we are inherently good . There ' s a lot of evidence on the primates that I can use to support that idea that we are inherently good , but on occasion when we get too competitive or frustrated , we turn bad .
