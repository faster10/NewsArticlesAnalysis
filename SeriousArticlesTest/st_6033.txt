The best way to combat this problem , said Donovan , is through a neighborhood mapping tool the agency will create that will provide information on jobs , schools and transportation . The agency believes the map will help ' expand access to high opportunity neighborhoods and draw attention to investment possibilities in under served communities , ' Donovan continued . The maps will allow planners and residents to view ' data on patterns of integration and segregation , racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty , ' as well as ' data on individuals with disabilities and families with children , and discrimination , ' according to the rule proposal . HUD will also further step up fair housing enforcement . In the past three over 54million in compensation has been awarded to 25 , 000 people who were wrongly discriminated against as a result of enforcement actions , Donovan noted .
