Manchester United and Chelsea have won 17 of the 23 English Premier League titles so far including seven in a row between 2005 and 2011 but Sunday s match up between the pair will be somewhat overshadowed by the battle of the top two 24 hours earlier . Chelsea go into the match unbeaten in eight league games , while United scored three fine goals against Stoke on Tuesday , but it s safe to say that , even as early as February , neither of them will win the league this season . That s quite a comedown for both , but there will still be plenty at stake at Stamford Bridge and the Red Devils will be desperate to end their run of nine games without a win against the Blues . Prediction : Chelsea 1 Man Utd 1 .
