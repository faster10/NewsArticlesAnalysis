Klopp , who suffered more than most from Bayern s reaction as they beat his Borussia Dortmund team to both the Champions League and Bundesliga title , said : Maybe City s announcement will focus players on silverware , but it is up to the team . Don t forget , the 2013 treble winning team of Bayern was unbelievably strong and they had all their players fit until the end . There were other factors too , like them losing a few titles in the years before . Jupp Heynckes and his team worked really good together but they didn t work well together because he had said he was leaving at the end of the season .
