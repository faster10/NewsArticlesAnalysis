After observing Pope Francis on his 10 previous out of Italy visits , what is clearly emerging as his new signature , is his role as a unifier and a top diplomat . He facilitated the restoration of diplomatic relations after 50 years of unhelpful tension between the US and Cuba . To me then , on this African visit , what will be the greatest act of evangelism by Pope Francis , if it happens , will be his mission in the CAR . It could dwarf the facilitation of cordial and diplomatic relations between Cuba and the US .
