In the media , whenever we say " mainstream , " we might as well be honest and admit that means white . I have heard cable and broadcast executives speak in those terms for years , and trust me , when they are thinking about the dominant audience , it means white . That ' s why when anyone is talking about media that targets demographics other than white , you ' ll hear the phrase " ethnic media . " For newspapers targeting African Americans , you ' ll hear " the black press . "
