Anyways . . I loved watching Lynch run . His beastquake run against the Saints in the playoffs was one of single greatest NFL moment I ve ever witnessed . He had long stretches of coming up big in the playoffs . Going back to my childhood he seems to be the real life Tecmo Bowl Bo Jackson or Christian Okoye in that it seemed impossible to consistently bring him down with less than 3 men . Besides Barry Sanders he is one of the few backs that consistently gave you good god I can t believe he did that on even 3 yard runs .
