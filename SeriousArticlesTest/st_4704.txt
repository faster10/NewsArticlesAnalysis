That s not to say King is a crappy writer or doesn t know what he s talking about . He is among the most respected football writers in the business and has written some good books about the game . But nowadays , he too often comes off as a mouthpiece for NFL commissioner Roger Goodell , who is the mouthpiece for the owners . Besides being a mouthpiece for a mouthpiece , King acts as something of a PR department for players and coaches . His Tom Brady fluff pieces come to mind .
