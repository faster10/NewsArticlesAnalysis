Between this year and last , the TV categories have moved beyond the occasional newcomer to being absolutely overcome with names the average TV goer might not be immediately familiar with . Last year , it was The Affair ' s Ruth Wilson , Jane the Virgin ' s Gina Rodriguez , and Fargo ' s Allison Tolman who scooped up the newcomer nods for their critically beloved ? but not massively rated ? first seasons . ( Wilson and Rodriguez even scored the wins in their categories , with The Affair talking home Best Drama and Transparent , also a brand new series , walking away with Best Comedy . )
