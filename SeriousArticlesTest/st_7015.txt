" Death of the Taliban chief at this stage might take the county back to the situation of the post Soviet withdrawal as the power struggle would intensify , " he said . Agha however ruled out such differences even if Manoor were to die . " I do not think that Taliban will be without a leader for long . Mullah Omar was the most well known Taliban leader and when he died , the group did not have any issues choosing a new leader and nor will they if Mullah Mansoor dies in the future . "
