This was an eye opening meeting for me . Even though I have this love for a culture I have never been a part of I had some anger in my heart about the fact that France banned hijab in their public schools . Muslim girls cannot cover their hair with a headscarf in their schools . This is painful for me to know because I picture my own sister in law who wears hijab and my cousin who wears hijab and my aunts in Europe who wear hijab and the thought of them being forced to show their hair when they have chosen long ago to keep it covered as a symbol of their devotion to God as absolutely mind blowing .
