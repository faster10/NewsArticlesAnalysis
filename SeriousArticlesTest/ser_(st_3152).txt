Donald Trump was humbled , even gracious , in thanking Iowans for second place , a place he hates , and his customary bravado was gone on the morning after . He s a fugitive balloon from the Macy s Thanksgiving parade , leaking every so slowly . The balloon will stay up for a while , but it will never quite bounce and float like it once did . He told Iowans he loves Iowa so much he might buy a farm in the neighborhood , but no one expects him to really care much about them unless he returns as the Republican nominee .
