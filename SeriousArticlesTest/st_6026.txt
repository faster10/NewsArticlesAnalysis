Christine Brennan ' s two recent columns on Greg Hardy can be summed up in a few unimaginative simple phrases : " Greg Hardy , bad Union , bad Dallas Cowboys , bad . " What I find to be even more intellectually dishonest is the expression of such opinions with a lack of fundamental understanding ? of the role of a union in these situations . I will explain it in simple terms : ? The NFL Players Association is a labor union . We have a Federal Law fair duty of representation to our members . Unions protect rights , not conduct . Collective Bargaining Agreements have to be enforced . We do not condone misconduct .
