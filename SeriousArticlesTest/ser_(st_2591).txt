Even though I was " born into Islam , " I choose Islam every day . It is my faith that I have embraced . I embrace it primarily for its logic . I embrace it for its justice . Justice to me means that all men are created equally under God ' s command . He did not make me any more superior or inferior to any other human being that came before me or any other human being that will come after me . The only difference between human beings in Islam is their level of piety : their level of submission to the will of God and striving to do good in this world . The entire premise of living life as a Muslim is serving others . On Judgment Day we will not be judged by how many cars we owned or if we were able to afford a mansion . We will be judged on how we treated our fellow human beings as well as precious beings in the animal kingdom as well . Living things . If we were given little or a lot did we try to share what it is that we do have with others ? Did we try to take away what others have ? Or did we try to help others be the best that they can be ? That is the essence of Islam . That is the essence of being a Muslim .
