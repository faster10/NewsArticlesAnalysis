HOW BOBBY JINDAL AND CHRIS CHRISTIE COULD MISS THE NEXT DEBATE . We don ' t know exactly which polls Fox Business is going to use to choose who ends up in the debates now less than one week away . But we do know that the stages could look different than it has before , reports ABC ' s RYAN STRUYK . After a series of bad national polls for Chris Christie , the New Jersey governor is in danger of missing the mainstage debate if Fox Business chooses to include an Investor ' s Business Daily poll from last week in its methodology . But on the flip side , Bobby Jindal would likely miss out on the undercard debate if the network chooses to exclude it . The only way the stages will stay the same as before is if Fox Business opts to exclude all three recent IBD TIPP , NBC WSJ and Quinnipiac polls from its polling criteria . But if the network chooses to include all three , Mike Huckabee and George Pataki will get bumped from their stages too . Candidates must have an average of 2 . 5 percent in the four most recent national polls to make the mainstage debate and must hit 1 percent in at least one of them to make the undercard debate .
