The Clippers have now lost three straight games and are currently just 6 7 overall , and there was a report after the game that Josh Smith got into a heated verbal exchange with an unspecified coach in the locker room . Tensions are clearly boiling in Los Angeles , but it s a little worrying that they are panicking this much considering it s still very early in the season . Call me crazy , but I think that there are some positives to take from all this . For starters , we all know just how competitive the Western Conference is going to be this season , and the race for playoff seeding is going to come down to the wire . Due to their slow start , the Clippers will have no choice but to play their key players heavy minutes down the stretch , so I think this really bodes well for the outlook of guys like Chris Paul , Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan .
