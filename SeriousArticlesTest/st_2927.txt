Shurmur : If you asked me Dec . 29 , the day Kelly was fired , Shurmur ' s chances of getting the job , it would have been less than five percent . Today , he might be the co favorite . He failed in his first try as a head coach in Cleveland , but everyone fails in Cleveland , so there ' s that . Nobody is really sure what he did in his three years as Kelly ' s offensive coordinator , but he ' s a nice man and the players seem to like him . To Lurie that seems to be very important .
