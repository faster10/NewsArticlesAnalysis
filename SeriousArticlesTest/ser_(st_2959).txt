Don ' t wander off . One of the girls in my group didn ' t show up at the agreed upon time that morning . A half an hour went by , and she still hadn ' t shown up . We all started worrying , and had no idea how we would ever find her in a sea of thousands of people , since she didn ' t have a cell phone . Finally , she appeared two hours later she apparently made some new friends the night before and lost track of time . Don ' t do this to your traveling companions !
