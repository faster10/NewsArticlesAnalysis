It is easy to forget that Clinton has differed with the White House in the past about how to frame a political race . In 2010 , working through Vice President Joe Biden , he urged Obama to make the case that the president had done a number of things to improve the lives of Americans in his first two years and suggested the president campaign on his record . But the White House resisted this approach , fearing the stimulus and health care reform were not popular enough to brag about and instead tried to make the Republican agenda the issue . Clinton disagreed but ( mostly ) kept his mouth shut about it . He doesn ' t seem willing to bite his tongue now .
