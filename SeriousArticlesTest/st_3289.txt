As a long term investor I love the foundation of low inflation , low input costs and technology making us energy independent , but as a trader , I understand that , in order to achieve that goal , the short term dislocations will be staggering . The velocity of the move will be based on the movement of the dollar in conjunction with other major global currencies A fast move higher in the U . S . dollar will force the price of crude lower quickly ( crude is denominated in dollars globally ) and force selling by those who need capital . This will be the catalyst for a deep correction ? maybe 20 to 30 percent .
