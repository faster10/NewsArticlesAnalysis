Janney : Yeah , I totally did . I have friends with daughters Dakota ' s age and I think it would be very tricky for me . I thought it was wonderful in that you ' re not sure what the outcome is . I don ' t believe in answers . Everyone gets to talk about whether or not they think she did it . Did she go to a new doctor or did she end up having the baby ? I definitely feel that it is between a woman and her doctor and her loved ones . That ' s where those decisions should be made not legislated by the government .
