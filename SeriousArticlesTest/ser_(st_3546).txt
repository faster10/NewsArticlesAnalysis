While the game was ultimately a blowout in favor of Clemson , things initially seemed to be going in Oklahoma s direction . Ridley had eight receptions for 138 yards and two touchdowns , and it was his 50 yard reception in the second quarter that set up the first touchdown of the game that really cleared the plumbing for Alabama s offense . The drive appeared to stall out after that , though , with a third down incomplete pass at the OU 44 . On 4th down punter Andy Teasdall , who made a mistake of trying to run for a 1st down during the ACC title game , threw a 31 yard pass to Christian Wilkins for a 1st down . Watson , named the game s Most Valuable Offensive Player , finished with 24 carries for 145 yards and a touchdown , while Gallman rushed for 150 yards and a score on 26 carries .
