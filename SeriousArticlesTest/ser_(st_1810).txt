Pew asked people who don ' t already borrow library e books whether they might avail themselves of library programs that would prepare them for using e books . Nearly half said they would be " very " or " somewhat " likely to borrow an e reading device that came loaded with a book they wanted . About a third would be at least somewhat likely to take library classes on how to download e books onto handheld devices ( including smartphones ) , or classes on how to use an e reader or tablet computer .
