But like any exercise program , it ' s important to take it slowly . " Any time you begin a new workout , you need to avoid doing too much , too soon . You don ' t want to go from zero to 60 in 10 seconds , " says Dr David Johnson , an orthopedic surgeon at Washington Hospital Center in Washington , D . C .

You should look to your instructor for guidance and make sure that person is keyed in to your fitness level . "
