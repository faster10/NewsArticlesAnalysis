" I ' m not a singer , " Hardy reportedly told ? The Sun last year . " I have no idea really . I ' m really trying because of Rocketman but it ' s hard to open my mouth in that way . " Meanwhile , he joined the project in 2013 and the biopic is still listed as " in development " on IMDb , so unfortunately it ' s possible that we may never see this happen .
