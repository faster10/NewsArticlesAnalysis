In 2008 , Barack Obama ran one of the great campaigns in the history of this country ? he rewrote the caucus rulebook right here in Iowa ? unbelievable , Sanders said . I m not saying that we can replicate that , but I think any objective look in our campaign and the energy and the excitement that it is generating with young people and with working people and compare that to Secretary Clinton s campaign , will come to the conclusion that if our goal is to have a large voter turnout , we are the campaign that can do that , meaning not only do we retain the White House , with a large voter turnout we can recapture the Senate , do better in the House , and win governors chairs all over the country .
