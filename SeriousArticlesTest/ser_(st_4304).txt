' I don ' t think it ' s a good time to spend . Last year we didn ' t bring in anyone in . The owners will always back what we want to do . If there was something we felt would benefit the group in the short or long term then we ' d do it , but I don ' t want to stockpile players . We ' ve got some outstanding young talents . My focus will always be on what we ' ve got from within .
