The results were remarkable : Not only were survival rates for people who got only compressions just as good as those for people who got traditional CPR , they actually were better . Why was it so effective ? Mouth to mouth resuscitation supplies oxygen , which we need continuously . As it turns out , our bloodstreams contain plenty of oxygen at any moment . Even if we stop breathing , our oxygen levels remain normal for quite a while . If we do stop breathing , however , the sole way to make the oxygen circulate is by having someone pump our chests .
