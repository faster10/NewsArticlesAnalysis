For decades , Ebola disease was confined to remote regions of Central Africa ? thousands of miles from Africa ' s populous Western coast . Researchers were able to use genetic sequencing to determine that the earliest known case of Ebola in the West African outbreak was a young boy in Guinea who was infected in December of 2013 . And they believe it ' s likely he got the disease from a bat . This doesn ' t necessarily mean that this one contaminated bat flew all the way from Central Africa , notes Bausch . You could have a bat that flies a couple of hundred miles to the northwest , then roosts with other bats , which , in turn , contract the virus . So over years or even decades the virus gets passed from one bat colony to another .
