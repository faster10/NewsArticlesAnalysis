The Patriots and Panthers were the last two undefeated teams this season , and the Panthers almost pulled off the first undefeated season since the 2007 Patriots . The Panthers got to 14 0 before losing in Week 16 at Atlanta . That takes nothing away from their season , which was incredible and rolled on with a win over the defending NFC champion Seahawks last week . What better way to legitimize their rise to the NFL ' s elite than to beat the other Super Bowl participant last year and finish as the NFL ' s first 18 1 champion in 30 years ?
