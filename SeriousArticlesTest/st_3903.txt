About the Broncos : Gotta start with the quarterback matchup , even if Manning hobbled through the worst season of his 18 year career . He is 5 11 against Brady , but a more respectable 2 2 in the playoffs . The two wins were the most recent postseason meetings ( following the 2006 and 2013 seasons ) and each was with a Super Bowl berth at stake . Manning ' s teams played at home both times . . . Manning is 7 12 against the Patriots since Belichick became the team ' s head coach in 2000 . . . Temple and North Penn alum Brandon McManus tied an NFL playoff record with five field goals in last week ' s win over the Steelers . . . Denver is 7 2 in AFC title games , the highest winning percentage ( . 778 ) leaguewide among teams that have played a minimum of five games . . . Broncos defensive linemen Malik Jackson and Antonio Smith added even more fun to the mix this week by calling Brady a whiner and a crybaby . . . Denver ' s run defense gave up 3 . 3 yards per carry , best in the NFL .
