The problem is not limited to oil . Prices of virtually all commodities have crashed since the boom of the 2000s , marking the end of a commodity supercycle . History shows that commodity prices rise and fall year after year in tandem with economic activity , but are also characterised by supercycles ? long booms followed by long busts ? every few decades . A major supercylical boom in the 1970s was followed by a long bust in the 1980s and 1990s , followed by the super boom of the 2000s .
