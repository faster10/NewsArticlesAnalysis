The Second Amendment has failed us tragically . Another mass shooting in California killing 14 people . If you believe that our Founding Fathers had this in mind when they added the Second Amendment to our Constitution , there is no hope for you . The NRA has failed us . Congress ( mostly conservatives ) has failed us by allowing its members to be bought and paid for with their votes against sensible gun regulations . With roughly 320 million guns out there , there is no solution to the 33 , 000 or so gun deaths that we suffer yearly in America . The genie is out of the bottle . Say goodbye to the late , great U S of A .
