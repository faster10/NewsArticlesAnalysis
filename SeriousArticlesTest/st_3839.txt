Like with Ralph Lauren for the U . S . Olympic team , a 156 million deal with Adidas makes the company a key sponsor of the London 2012 Olympics . The company is providing sportswear for the British Olympic and Paralympic Associations , and owns exclusive licensing rights for all sportswear sold at London 2012 venues and stores . Like Ralph Lauren , Adidas is not manufacturing the majority of its products in the UK , or even in Europe , but is sourcing its Olympic apparel from a range of low wage countries including China , Cambodia , India , Indonesia , Pakistan , the Philippines , Vietnam and Sri Lanka .
