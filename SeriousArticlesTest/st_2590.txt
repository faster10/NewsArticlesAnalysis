Even though we expressed that we don ' t agree with the French banning of the hijab in public school understanding their viewpoint of it and hearing it out of their mouths in the calming demeanor that they espouse in the sincere manner that they express themselves made me truly understand their viewpoint . For them all religious signage in public school has been banned as they feel it creates division in their schools . So their intention behind it is a pure one even if I don ' t agree with it . And I left that meeting with my heart soaring . And I hope they left it feeling the same way as we explained our experience as Muslims in American society and what we deal with and how we try to build bridges here .
