It is a great tragedy of the Muslim world that its leadership at this crucial juncture in world history is in the hands of two myopic sectarian states like Saudi Arabia and Iran , more interested in undermining each other than helping their own people secure a better life . Pakistan s attempt , while noble in intent , to bring an end to conflict between these two Muslim powers is , therefore , likely to end in failure . The great gift of nature to these countries , i . e . oil , is going to be their undoing . Little or no effort has been made by either of the countries to modernise their economies . We in Pakistan , thankfully spared the curse of oil , must learn a lesson from the example of these two brotherly nations . We must ensure that our policies are never determined by reactionary mullahs , sectarian bigots or theocrats of any kind .
