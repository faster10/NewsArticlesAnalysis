The Panthers capitalized quickly . A 45 yard Graham Gano field goal on Carolina s opening drive started the scoring , and the Panthers second drive ended with Ted Ginn Jr . scoring on a play out of a high school playbook , taking a handoff from Newton on second and 3 from the Cards 22 and dashing left to the 10 . Ginn seemed bottled up there , but then he reversed field , cutting all the way across the grain and waltzing untouched into the end zone , a 22 yard score .
