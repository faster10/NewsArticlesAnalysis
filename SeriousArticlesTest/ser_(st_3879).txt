" It ' s a total employers ' market , " says John Schmitt , a senior economist at the progressive Center for Economic and Policy Research . He argues that the first and foremost effect is an erosion of the bargaining positions for workers everywhere . " If you are looking for a job , you take whatever is offered . If you have a job , you don ' t complain . If wages are going to be frozen , if benefits are going to be cut , you suck it up . There ' s not much you can do . "
