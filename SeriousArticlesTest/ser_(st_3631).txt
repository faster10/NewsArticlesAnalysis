Anti s lack of an obvious Rihanna smash places the album in the same tradition of previous surprise releases from Beyonc , Azealia Banks and , heck , even Miley Cyrus ( though the way Anti sputtered across the finish line barely qualifies as a surprise at this point ) . Beyonc wondered aloud if she d make no money from her 2013 opus about motherhood , marriage and feminism . ( She rode her surfbort to the top anyway . ) Banks oft delayed Broke With Expensive Taste signaled that the rapper wasn t interested in trying to top her breakout hit 212 , and she even had her own Rihanna Tame Impala moment with an alternate version of an Ariel Pink song . Cyrus so urgently wanted listeners to meet her new , psychedelic self that she released her marijuana fueled Dead Petz album for free without counting it toward her record label contract . These artists had a perspective that was more important than their commercial prospects , more important than who listeners thought they were or what kind of music they made before .
