When I first got here , it was hard , she said . People said to me , What are you doing ? You re the face of CNBC why would you leave ? And I found myself explaining more than I thought I would have to . The fact is Fox News Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes has been a mentor to me my entire career . He put me on the air . He was the person who oversaw me becoming the first person to report live from the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . I have very high regard for him . Secondly , I thought audiences were changing , and I had been there for 20 years .
