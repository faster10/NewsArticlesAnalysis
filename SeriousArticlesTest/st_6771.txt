Nelson ' s call on the 2 1 pitch to Revere was very bad and it hurt the Blue Jays big time . It ' s also not the reason they lost . They had the tying run at third base with no outs , so they had three chances to get him in , and they failed all three times . Also , Toronto went 0 for 12 with runners in scoring position in Game 6 . 0 for 12 ! They had chances earlier in the game in addition to that ninth inning . Nelson ' s call was bad . The Blue Jays ' situational hitting was way worse .
