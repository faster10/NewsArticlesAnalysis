As New York ' s Mayor Michael Bloomberg put it : " If somebody wants to build a religious house of worship , they should do it and we shouldn ' t be in the business of picking which religions can and which religions can ' t . I think it ' s fair to say if somebody was going to try to on that piece of property build a church or a synagogue , nobody would be yelling and screaming . And the fact of the matter is that Muslims have a right to do it , too . "
