Though not as thrilling as Radiator Springs Racers , Luigi ' s Flying Tires is still unlike anything you ' ve ever ridden , unless you happened to ride Flying Saucers at Disneyland between 1961 and 1966 . Or you have shrunken down and ridden on an air hockey puck . In this update of the Flying Saucers concept , giant tires float on a cushion of air supplied by a bunch of small air jets . Riders lean to make their tires move . Adding to the fun is a bunch of beach balls that riders can run into , poke and bat at each other . ( Thumbs up from the kids . )
