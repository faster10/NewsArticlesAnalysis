The album took almost as many producers and writers as her last record did , but without liner notes , it d be easy to believe her pool of collaborators , which includes Timbaland and the Weeknd , was much smaller given how well these songs fit together . Their consistency also helps explain why last year s string of Rihanna singles ? the Kanye West Paul McCartney collaboration FourFiveSeconds , the ruthless Bitch Better Have My Money , the quasi political American Oxygen ? didn t make the final cut . They would have been jarring inclusions on an album that , if anything , is a work of unexpected subtlety from an artist rarely associated with that word . ( That , or Rihanna wanted a fresh start on an album the Internet was starting to treat like a big joke . )
