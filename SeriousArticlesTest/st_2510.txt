For the Chiefs fans that don t normally visit Pats comments sorry you will be subjected to a week of inanity like this as well as the trash talking yahoos that attach themselves to winning teams that regularly contend . With the direction Reid has the Chiefs going in you will have even more of your own yahoos soon enough . You will also see user names you have never seen before presenting themselves as KC fans trolling NE . They , along with their faux Pats fans counterparts that will be trolling KC , are a subset of the no life hateroids that target NE .
