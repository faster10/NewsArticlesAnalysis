So . . . lovely as it is to spend the evening with you Jana , that was a bit crap wasn t it ? The main event was better than the kiddie table warm up and for such a busy debate there was some fairly substantive stuff on taxes , on H1 B visas and a few digs at the Fed ( stay with me ) . . . but minimum wage ? No . Women s wages ? I love my mom , government s bad , OK ?
