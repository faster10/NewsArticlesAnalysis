The Schulzes aren ' t taking any big leaps with the story , which sees the elusive Little Red Haired Girl moving in across the street from Charlie Brown , sending our smitten hero into a full blown panic . " She ' s something , and I ' m nothing , " he laments , the familiar wail of anguish that defines the character . Chuck ' s quest to be " something " will lead him to Lucy ' s psychiatrist booth ? still five cents , unaffected by inflation ? and a quest to become a " winner , " putting him in the paths of fan favorites like Sally and Peppermint Patty .
