Controlling their drone via a satellite link , and using a second Reaper as a " spotter " aircraft , they selected their target and released a Hellfire missile from 3000m . Experts say the Reaper may have been several miles away , invisible in the night sky . Its missile , travelling at Mach 1 . 3 ( 1601km h ) , arrived at such speed that Emwazi would have known nothing before it struck . At 11 . 51pm , the car and its four occupants were blown to pieces .
