The Panthers are tied at No . 6 for the most sacks in the NFL with 26 this year . It ' s obvious that their strong defense has been a huge part of their incredible 9 0 start , but we ' ve surprisingly seen Cousins only get sacked 12 times this season . If Carolina can tally a few sacks on Washington ' s signal caller , it ' s going to go a long way toward extending their undefeated season to 10 0 , but it won ' t be an easy task .
