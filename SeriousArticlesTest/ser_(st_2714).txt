The official festival website also added its condolences : " You always had a sparkle in your eyes whenever you dealt with people . For all of us , who were fortunate enough to cross your path , you will always remain the one who questioned certainties . And , why not ? You would repeatedly ask the same question when we tried to explain why a project would not be feasible . Reality was never challenged only your wildest dreams . The Montreux Jazz Festival is the ultimate proof of that ! But not the only one !
