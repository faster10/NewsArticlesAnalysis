I have a photo that I love of the old poet , Robert Frost , in a winter hat with long earflaps , in heavy boots , a stick in hand . He is walking through a snowy field not far from where I live . He often wrote poems about being alone in the woods or fields in deep snow . I think , for instance , of " Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening " or the ferocious " Goodbye , and Keep Cold , " where he says : " Dread fifty above more than fifty below . " He ' s speaking to a stand of trees that seem not to mind the arctic weather , these resilient " Maples and birches and tamarack . " I ' m afraid that human beings rarely like it when it gets so cold .
