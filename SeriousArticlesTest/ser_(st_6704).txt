" Here s what I do know , " he said . " The Missouri football team and Coach Pinkel made a stand for something they thought was right . It was really bold by Coach Pinkel and I believe when you mentor and coach young men and invite them into your family you want to do everything you can to protect them . . . .

Just watching from afar , I really respect how that situation was handled by him and his program . "
