Lead single " Make Some Noise " sets the tone with the group ' s feistiest and funniest groove since " Intergalactic " soundtracked the summer of 1998 . ( Have you listened to " Hello Nasty " lately ? Even nuttier than you remember . ) The Beasties ride vintage synths and cowbell , with MCA chanting , " We gonna party for the mother ( expletive ) right to fight ! " Amid references to Rotary Connection and Ted Danson , Ad Rock drops the best line : " Can ' t tell me nothing , can ' t tell me nada Don ' t quote me now because I ' m doing the Lambada . "
