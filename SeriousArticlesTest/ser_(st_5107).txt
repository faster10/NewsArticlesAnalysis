" I ' m very disappointed because I have the feeling we could have won this game and we didn ' t , " he said . " We gave the goal away and other chances that they had we gave away also . So we could have lost the game in spite of our dominance . I think when you want to be the champions at the end of the season then you have to win these kind of games and we didn ' t do that so I ' m disappointed . "
