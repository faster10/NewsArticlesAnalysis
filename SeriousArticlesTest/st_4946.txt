A few years later , in the early 90 ' s , in the Netherlands , Tijs Michiel Verwest began his journey to becoming Ti sto . He also started when the genre was completely underground . A trip to Spain , some parties and general love for music got him interested in becoming a DJ . " Back then , first of all , we all played vinyl records , so even when you knew the track , you could not get it . Everything was very exclusive , " says Ti sto in his dressing room , 300 meters away from the main stage of TomorrowWorld .
