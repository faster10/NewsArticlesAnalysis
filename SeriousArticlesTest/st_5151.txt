The biggest disappointment , I would say overall , has been partisanship on a number of issues . For me , I think this really started , or at least it reared it ' s head during another disappointing process or development , which was the expulsion hearings ( of Courser and Gamrat ) . That became very partisan . It was a situation where there was unanimous support on the Republican side to expel two of our members , and unfortunately we went until the wee hours of the morning to get the 2 3 votes we needed because there was political gamesmanship going on that then continued into other areas ? third grade reading ? it then continued to the bills we just passed ( in December ) regarding the data centers . It is something that is very prevalent , and it is disappointing . I certainly understand that we ' re going to have differences on policy , and that is to be expected , but to the extent that it is holding up things . Take the third grade reading , for example . Take the expulsion vote . That wasn ' t about the subject matter of the vote , but rather that was how do we clobber each other . In this case , how do we clobber Republicans and try to take back control of the chamber .
