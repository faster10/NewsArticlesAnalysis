I ' m carrying two radiation meters with me , one to measure surface radiation and one to track how much my body accumulates . The surface reader begins to climb , as soon as we drive past the entryway , even though I haven ' t placed it next to a contaminated surface , which residents hope will be decontaminated within a few years . The release of radiation from the plant primarily covered the communities to the north of the plant . Tomioka , in the southern end of the exclusion zone , has a lower level of contamination than towns to the north and northwest of the plant .
