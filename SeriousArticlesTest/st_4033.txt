I asked all of my interview subjects to give me whatever they had on paper from the time : diaries , letters , academic notes and reports . Some of it no longer had relevance , but the prospecting yielded many nuggets of gold . My mother found a diary that her father had written as a missionary in Africa in the 1930s , dreaming of returning to Europe to help battle Hitler . Longtime friends gave me a series of letters that my mother had written in the happy early years of her marriage , when I was a toddler and my parents took me with them to England and Africa while they did field research . There was another batch from the ugliest days of their divorce , when we were living in Los Angeles and she was on the verge of losing her mind . My father ' s brother in law searched through a drawer and found a 12 page testimonial that my black granddad dictated to an attendant in a nursing home on his 75th birthday . His " autobiography , " as he called it , recorded how he grew up on a tenant farm in Texas , the son of a sharecropper who was born a slave , and how he made his way north as a teenager to work in the Pittsburgh steel plants and then became one of the city ' s first black funeral home owners .
