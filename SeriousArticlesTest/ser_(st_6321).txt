Word of the Internet monitoring order comes as China prepares for its 18th National Congress of the Communist Party , scheduled in the latter half of this year . Beijing will select its new party leadership to guide the nation forward . The country has seen public security officials step up moves against dissent ahead of the congress , such as the summer crackdown on illegal expatriates living in Beijing , closure of web sites and the suspension of China ' s major microblogging sites for several days earlier this year . The sites closed were " punished for allowing rumors to spread " of a coup attempt in Beijing , state run media reported at the time . The rumors spread after the shocking March dismissal of Communist Party politburo member and Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai . His wife , Gu Kailai , was found guilty of murdering a British businessman and received a suspended death sentence on Monday , though she ' ll likely be jailed for life .
