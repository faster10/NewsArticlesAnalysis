" USC is playing a lot more guys because they have had a lot of injuries , " Stanford coach David Shaw said . " Those guys are good football players . They ' re playing well in the offensive line . They ' re playing physical . Their stable of running backs have been real good . They are efficient and explosive in the passing game . They ' re not throwing as much , but are still getting production . Defensively , they ' ve been playing really well , even with a lot of guys banged up . They ' re very aggressive . I don ' t think at any point in the season they were playing terribly . "
