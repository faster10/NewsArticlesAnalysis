The first thing I need to point out is that the Cardinals returned two Aaron Rodgers ' fumbles for touchdowns in that game . Call me crazy , but I don ' t think that ' s going happen this week . Basically , I think I ' m saying that the Cardinals aren ' t 30 points better than the Packers as their 38 8 win showed , it ' s probably closer to 14 . However , I can ' t pick the Cardinals by 14 because Carson Palmer used to play for the Bengals and the Bengals are cursed .
