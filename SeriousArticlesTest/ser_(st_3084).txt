" The perp walk takes place at the moment where you ( are ) supposed to be innocent , " said Strauss Kahn , who calls himself DSK . " You ' re just shown to everybody as if you were a criminal , at a moment where nobody knows if it ' s true or not maybe you ' re a criminal , maybe you ' re not . That ' s going to be proved later on , and so it is just unfair to put people in that way in front of the rest of the world when you just don ' t know what they have done . "
