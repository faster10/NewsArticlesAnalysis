The ALCS returns to Kansas City tonight as the Royals try for the second time to eliminate the Blue Jays . Toronto sends David Price to the mound , a reassuring thought for any fan who only watches regular season games . Price , a five time All Star and 2012 Cy Young winner , has a 5 . 44 ERA in seven postseason starts . His team has lost all seven games . Price held the Jays scoreless in Game 2 through six innings before collapsing in the seventh . He ll oppose Yordano Ventura , who also didn t pitch well in that game . There was plenty of talk about Kershaw s playoff struggles before he pitched very well this season . Toronto is banking its season that Price turns it around tonight .
