Things got a bit precarious for Westwood , 42 , who needed the high finish in Thailand to move into the top 50 in the Official World Ranking , thus getting him an invitation to the Masters . But the Englishman was undoubtedly fortunate . The Thailand finish moved him to 50th with two weeks remaining in the year . The Masters takes the top 50 off the final ranking . A week later , he fell to 51st , then by the final week he had moved back to 50th to get his spot in the first major .
