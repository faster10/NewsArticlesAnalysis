Only one problem . If there ' s anything Broncos defensive coordinator Wade Phillips likes to do , though , it ' s send extra pressure after the quarterback . Phillips is a habitual , inveterate blitzer . He sent five or more men after the opposing passer 41 . 7 percent of the time this season , the fourth highest rate in football . Only the Cardinals , Jets and Titans blitzed more frequently . Given Denver ' s excellent secondary and its No . 1 ranking atop the defensive DVOA charts , you can ' t really fault Phillips , either .
