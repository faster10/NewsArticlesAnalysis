Primarily , as an attempt to deflect people s attention away from the BJP s colossal defeat in the Bihar assembly elections , this session began with a two day commemoration of Babasaheb Ambedkar s 125th birth anniversary . After 65 years of our Republic , the BJP has suddenly discovered that on November 26 , 1949 , the Constituent Assembly adopted the draft Constitution . This day has now been gazetted as Constitution Day to be observed every year . This government is seeking to obliterate the fact that the Constituent Assembly met again on January 24 and 25 , 1950 , when all members signed the draft Constitution to be enacted on the appointed date , January 26 , 1950 . This exposes the RSS BJP s desperation to associate themselves with our freedom movement , in which they had no role whatsoever .
