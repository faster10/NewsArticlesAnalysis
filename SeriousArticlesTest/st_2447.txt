Two down . Now my hopes are riding on " Lullaby . " I check out the Internet Movie Database and wish I hadn ' t : " Lullaby " has a user rating of 2 . 8 out of 10 . Leo is Stephanie , a waitress who is getting hit up for money by a foreign gangster who says he has her ( grown ) son , a junkie . So Stephanie does what any self respecting mom would do . She sells her car , borrows from her friends , and buys a plane ticket to South Africa to deliver the thug his ransom in person .
