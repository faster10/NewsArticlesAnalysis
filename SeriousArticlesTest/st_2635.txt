I wanted to say something , also , Larry , which I forgot to say about what I just did today . I delivered 250 , 000 postcards signed by people all across the country who wanted to help give some political capital to and remind this administration of how important this issue is . It was from the Save Darfur people . But it ' s from all across the country . And we ' re probably going to have another 700 , 000 by the end of the week .
