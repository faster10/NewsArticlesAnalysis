Matthew Green , Research Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University , says that of the four different fonts , ' False ' could be most promising , but that in his view camouflaged fonts are not terribly effective at protecting people ' s privacy : " For standard optical character recognition that ' s tuned to read traditional typefaces and handwriting , yes , I think ( these fonts ) will be confusing . . . But if the NSA really wants to detect this data ? Not really . The problem here is that the fonts don ' t appear to be randomized , which means every time I type the letter ' A ' I ' ll get the same letter . To an OCR program these letters are just shapes . The funny looking A shape is no more difficult to detect than a real A shape . "
