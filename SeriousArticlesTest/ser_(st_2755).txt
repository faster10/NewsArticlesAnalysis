It ' s tempting to write off Kansas City ' s 30 0 win over Houston on Saturday as the product of a Brian Hoyer disaster movie , but that sells the Chiefs short . It would be fair to say they left a few plays on the field and didn ' t produce a perfect performance , but it wasn ' t as if Hoyer was Jay Cutler without a contact lens during the season . He threw seven picks on 369 attempts Hoyer ' s 1 . 9 percent interception rate was better than the league average of 2 . 4 percent . Forcing him into four picks was a reminder that this is a truly great defense .
