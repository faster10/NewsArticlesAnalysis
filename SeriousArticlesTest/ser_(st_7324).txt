It may well be good . These Giants have a bye and then six more games , and they ' re smack in the middle of a real playoff race . At 5 5 , they lead the NFC East by a half game over both Philadelphia and Washington . Should those teams both win next week , there would be a three way tie for first with six games to go , and the Giants have a game left against each of them . That opportunity is all you can ask , and it ' s possible that all the missed opportunities of this season so far Dallas , New Orleans , this latest one here can harden and galvanize a young Giants team in time for them to win big games down the stretch .
