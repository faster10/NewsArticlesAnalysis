This theme was picked up on by his Republican colleagues , who weren t nearly as subtle in their dishonesty as Gowdy was . Rep . Mike Pompeo grandiosely asked Clinton if Stevens had had Clinton s cell phone number , fax number , or home address , and if he d ever stopped by your house . After Clinton said no to all these things , Pompeo went in for what he thought was the kill : Mr Blumenthal had each of those and did each of those things . This man who provided you so much information on Libya had access to you in ways that were very different from the access that a very senior diplomat had to you and your person . If you re the sort of thick headed dolt who thinks the ambassador was at a disadvantage because he couldn t send the Secretary of State a postcard or pop in on her every Sunday afternoon , then this point was probably quite compelling .
