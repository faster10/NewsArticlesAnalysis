Lampe : For me , what I love about the mobile phone camera is this fixed lens mentality . It has its own set of challenges . One of the best things about Instagram is that because of the challenges of shooting on mobile , people look to tell stories differently than they would with a traditional photo outlet . With this project , we did some things that have become popular on the platform . For example , the " dear portrait " is when you hold up a physical photo from the past in a current location . You try to line it up with what ' s there .
