' I ' ve met a ton of people I never thought I would meet . It ' s been so busy that I haven ' t been able to sit down and process it . I ' ve been on Seth Meyers and The Talk ? and got to go the LA Clippers game and meet Jamie Foxx , Floyd Mayweather and Zab Judah . It ' s so fun to be able to meet these people outside of TV and to get to know them a little bit .
