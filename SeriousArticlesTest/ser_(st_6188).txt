What worries me is that as these old borders and international zones disappear , security barriers become the new borders . We ve seen this in the Middle East and they are rapidly being erected across Europe . These worry me more than the term terrorism . They create these kinds of conceptual contours ? it s not just a wall , it s a wall that defines a lot of cultural beliefs and misbeliefs . We are damaging ourselves with these walls ? we are damaging our ability to think , our ability to be creative .
