Garnett : Estimates vary . For the UK it ' s around 19 percent , but one EU report puts European emissions at 31 percent . The thing to understand is this is a relative statistic , so if you ' re talking about a society where people don ' t have many cars and TVs , then the proportion will be quite high . It may actually be lower in countries with a high material standard of living . Also , the estimates differ depending upon the boundaries they use , what ' s included and what ' s not included in the calculations .
