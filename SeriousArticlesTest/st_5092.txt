I guess if parents don ' t care if their son thinks being a man begins and ends with his penis , then yes , I can see how some would think raising a boy is easier . But if you ' re actually trying to raise a gentleman , and you hear LMFAO rap " I ' m running through these hos like Drano " as they do in " Party Rock Anthem , " the second most popular song of 2011 then you ' re not breathing a sigh of relief because it ' s so much easier to raise a boy . Instead you ' re wondering how much of what you ' re trying to teach him soaks in , versus what our culture says is OK .
