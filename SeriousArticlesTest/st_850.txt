Wrote fattsmann : " I ' m Chinese American and I agree that mainland Chinese are horrible tourists based on my trips to Europe and the Middle East . The article hits all the key notes and as other comments have noted , Americans had the same stigma problems about 1 2 decades ago . The key issues are education and awareness of foreign cultures ( including learning the basics of a foreign language before travel ) , respect for foreign cultures and customs , and patience ( including waiting in line , not making snap defensive judgments , etc . ) . Years ago , it was Americans that were rude and culturally insensitive tourists . Now it ' s the Chinese . Then it will be another group of people with money to travel . "
