HAPPENING TODAY IT ' S LIKE CHRISTMAS MORNING FOR THE NEW HAMPSHIRE CROWD : Or perhaps more like that day when pitchers and catchers finally report for spring training , ABC ' s BRAD MIELKE reports . New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner ' s door is opening to a crowd of candidates filing to get on the ballot in New Hampshire . Martin O ' Malley will be the first major candidate to file his paperwork . Donald Trump follows him . One fun fact : when Hillary comes next week , it will be her fourth time filing in Bill Gardner ' s office . She of course filed in 2008 , but also filed on behalf of Bill Clinton in ' 92 and ' 96 . http : abcn . ws 1Wx989R
