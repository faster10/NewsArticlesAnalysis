" This is something that we are able to do in this country because we define a Canadian not by a skin colour or a language or a religion or a background . But by a shared set of values , aspirations , hopes and dreams that not just Canadians but people around the world share . And how you will receive these people tonight will be something they will remember for the rest of their lives , but also I know something that you will remember for the rest of your lives . And I thank you deeply for being a part of this because this matters , tonight matters , not just for Canada but for the world .
