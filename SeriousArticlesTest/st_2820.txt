The Vermont Senator was expected to do well in New Hampshire ( for obvious reasons ) , but a win in Iowa , where Clinton has committed considerable resources , would be a major coup . Clinton can absorb a loss in New Hampshire and still coast to the nomination , but an early defeat in Iowa could change the entire narrative . ? Momentum is crucial in a campaign , and it can shift in a hurry . Early primary states can alter the trajectory of race , particularly if it s an insurgent candidate like Sanders , who is running against the Democratic establishment as much as he is Clinton . But if Sanders manages to sweep Iowa and New Hampshire , which is now a distinct possibility , the race will be wide open .
