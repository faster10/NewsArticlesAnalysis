Why Ben Carson isn t just your new GOP front runner he s a strong GOP front runner : That s our takeaway from our new NBC WSJ poll . Not only is Carson leading the Republican horse race with the highest percentage yet in our poll ( 29 ) , he also hits 50 when you combine GOP voters first and second choices ? the only Republican presidential candidate to do that . Then take the fact that he s raising the most money in the Republican race ( his campaign reported raising 10 million in October alone , putting it on pace to raise 30 million for the quarter ) . And then add in that he gets the most social media interaction when it comes to Facebook . Anyone who wants to dismiss Carson as Herman Cain or Michele Bachmann is making a big mistake . Sure , it s more than possible that Carson doesn t ultimately become the GOP nominee . But NBC WSJ co pollster Peter Hart ( D ) makes a convincing case that the 2016 dynamic on the Republican side could have some similarities to 1964 , when Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater . What if the cake is baked ? Hart asks . This is not a status quo electorate .
