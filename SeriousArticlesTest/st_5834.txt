As Poli said , the chances are that the real , devastating impact of this sporting catastrophe will actually be played out in the coming days and weeks and nobody knows yet quite how bad it will be . Forget the TV pictures of the pretty girls crying in the stands as Germany humiliated Brazil in the Estadio Mineirao . Their pain is unlikely to have lingered much longer than it took to take a taxi home to the suburbs . The real anguish here will be felt by those at the other end of the lop sided socio economic pyramid . It will be felt by those still waiting for proper roads in Natal , a subway completion in Salvador ( work began in 2001 ) and a proper drainage system in Recife .
