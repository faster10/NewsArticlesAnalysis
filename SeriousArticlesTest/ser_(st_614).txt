But that s still not Rubio s biggest liability as a presidential candidate . I tend to think it s a little more significant that much of Rubio s policy platform is based on lies and discredited economic theories . Just today he released his plan for exploding the military budget well beyond its current levels as part of his neoconservative foreign policy vision to pick fights and spread freedom at gunpoint . He s going to provoke international conflicts and preside over a vast expansion of defense spending while also blowing a hole in the budget by slashing tax rates , eliminating taxes on investments , and creating new tax credits for the middle class . The last Republican president implemented a more modest version of this policy agenda , and the results ? intractable military quagmires , exploding inequality , huge deficits ? left him so widely reviled that he put himself in political exile , where he remains to this day .
