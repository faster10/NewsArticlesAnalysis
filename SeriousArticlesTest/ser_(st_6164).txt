Now , politicians are getting involved . Look for President Obama to take a stroll on Saturday , most likely with his daughters and most likely to some locally owned bookstore like DC ' s Politics and Prose , to buy a few items with a credit card that will be discreetly handed to him by a helpful aide . Turn the channel and you ' ll likely see most of the dozens of Presidential candidates doing the same in their own local communities while making sure everyone is well aware of their passionate " support for small businesses " ( which is kind of like saying you support cancer research or puppies because . . . you know . . . who doesn ' t support small businesses , right ? ) . Congress is , of course , honoring the day with a special resolution . States and local governments across the country are issuing their own proclamations . You ' ll hear very similar sound bites about how small businesses " employ more than half of working Americans " and " how we ' re the backbone of this country . " Yay for us !
