" But Mr Obama because he hasn ' t had a strategy is engaged in the very unchartered mission creep in Syria he has repeatedly vowed would never happen on his watch . But the skies over Syria are dominated by the U . S . air force , over 500 million has been squandered training imaginary rebels , with more and more " boots on the ground " that the president asserts are merely wearing socks .
