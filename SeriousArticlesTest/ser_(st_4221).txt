Based on the results , Brasky says that men with a family history of prostate cancer should discuss with their doctor whether fish oil supplements are safe for them , since these pills tend to contain concentrated doses of omega 3 supplements contain between 30 to 60 of a serving of fish , and if a fish oil supplement is taken everyday , that adds up to a lot of daily fish oil . Brasky also suggested that men cut down on their fatty fish intake , though not eliminate it entirely .
