Ironically , for a movie that ' s marketed with the one liner " Life ' s a messy business , " Holley ' s script has been polished to within an inch of its life . Emotions are experienced most vividly when they ' re raw , but in " Sunshine Cleaning , " feelings come filtered through neat and tidy grace notes . The film flirts with dangerous material , but it ' s too intent on putting the sunny side up to get its hands dirty . The way director Jeffs tells it , not only is suicide painless it can be positively feel good .
