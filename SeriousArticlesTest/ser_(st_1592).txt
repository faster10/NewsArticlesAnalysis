One year ago today , two radical Islamic terrorists walked into the offices of Charlie Hebdo , a satirical newspaper in Paris , and opened fire , killing 11 journalists and wounding 11 more . Upon leaving the building they also killed a French police officer , bringing the total number of dead and wounded to 23 . The terrorists espoused a murderous ideology that recoils at the thought , as I wrote at the time , of the very notion of a free society where individuals have the right to worship , vote , and express themselves as they please . They are not interested in negotiation ? only in the complete and utter surrender of Western society to their brutal , totalitarian version of Islam .
