Today is just a day that I really want to celebrate my career and dwell on the positive parts of my career . So many of those things are just out of my control . It s just something I can t worry about . It s an interesting world today . There are so many outlets out there . For me , as a player , as I ve said , I ve been blessed to focus on my job . When I showed up and played , I had a lot to prepare to play . That s kind of what I focused on . As a player , you put all the numbers up you can , and you work as hard as you can , and it s like an artist you put it out there and people can be critical and people can be complimentary . I ve been blessed that a lot of people have been very complimentary . I ve truly found it healthy in life to just be positive , try to set a good example , try to be appreciative of your blessings , and just kind of keep it at that . That s the freedom we have . You can say these things , and that s the country we live in . But , at the end of the day , you can do so much as a player . That s what I focus on .
