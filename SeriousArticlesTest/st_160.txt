Hey , Brady s gonna play till he s 70 , Belichick s gonna coach till he s 90 , Manning said . Maybe I hit the fountain of youth in the next month and I play another 10 years . Maybe we play in 10 more championships against each other . But just in case we don t , I took the time to look them in the eye , man to man , shook their hands and I m glad that I did it because it was important to me that they knew that . There in the moment , face to face , man to man , that s all that that meant .
