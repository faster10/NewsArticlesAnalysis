Yeah , yeah , being Rihanna is an awfully hard job , you might be thinking , but she earns the listener s sympathy when she looks herself in the mirror on the guitar driven , Dido evoking ( ! ) Never Ending and admits she doesn t like ? or even recognize ? what she sees . I knew your face once but now it s unclear I can t find my body now separate from here and now , she sings . In exploring her unhappiness at the top , Rihanna finds her most compelling voice yet .
