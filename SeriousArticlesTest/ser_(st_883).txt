For example , many people don ' t factor in the kicking game when attempting to diagnose an offense ' s issues , but a kicker having a sudden cold streak can cost a team a few points per week . That has not been the case in Green Bay , though . Mason Crosby was 18 for 18 on extra points through the first six weeks of the season and is 7 for 7 over the last five weeks . He was 10 for 11 on field goals through six weeks and is 9 for 10 over the last five . His drop in production appears to be almost solely based on the lack of touchdowns scored by his teammates .
