With Marcus Smart ( leg ) out for at least a couple weeks , Avery Bradley jumped back into the starting lineup and exploded for 27 points , seven treys , four boards and two steals in 40 minutes ! The guy is unconscious right now and has been flirting with top 50 value , so sell high if you can . His averages of 20 . 2 points , 3 . 2 treys , 2 . 0 steals and 2 . 0 assists over his last five games are unsustainable , but be sure to ride him while he is hot . Isaiah Thomas also had 27 points with six assists in 31 minutes , and Smart s absence will ensure that Thomas and Bradley will have huge workloads for Boston s upcoming four game week .
