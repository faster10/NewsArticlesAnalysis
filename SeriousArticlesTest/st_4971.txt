Brock is my brother , Peyton is my brother , Manning s leading receiver , Emmanuel Sanders , said afterward . But Peyton wants to go out if he does go out I m not saying he is going to retire , but still : I know he wants another Super Bowl . We ve got an opportunity . Ever since I touched down in Denver , I ve been saying , I m playing for Peyton . I want him to win another Super Bowl because I know how much the game means to him .
