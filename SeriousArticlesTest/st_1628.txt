" You need to create a new pathway , a new happy memory , " Villacorta says . " I tell my clients that when afternoon comes and you have those cravings , maybe what you need to do is get up and take a two minute walk . Or take 10 deep breaths , which will also help lower cortisol levels . Maybe you really are hungry , in which case you need to eat something both satisfying and nutritious . You have to find other ways of channeling the energy and coping . "
