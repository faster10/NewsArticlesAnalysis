Grammer : He ' s probably the brightest guy I ' ve ever played . He ' s the greatest fighter I ' ve ever played . MacBeth is similar to him , certainly . What I love about MacBeth is that he starts out as a hero and ends up as heroically evil in the end . So Tom Kane might start out where MacBeth is , but Tom Kane will fight you for that last ounce of life . I love that about that character . I wish I was more like him .
