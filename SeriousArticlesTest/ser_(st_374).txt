Back in 1971 , I was present as top leaders of two political organizations met to negotiate common actions they could take despite their differences . One of those leaders was a woman . Over and over , she raised points for consideration , only to be ignored by both sides . When someone of the other team did agree with a proposal she made , he would wait a few minutes and then say so to one of her male colleagues , as though the suggestion had been his . " As you said , Jerry , " or " That ' s probably the way to go , Sam . "
