But there ' s a whole world of customising apps out there available exclusively to Android phones . For example , you can choose to change the way your very home screen looks , or how your apps are organised by using something called an app launcher . I personally use Yahoo ' s Aviate , which automatically organises apps by type , time of day and location . So if I ' m at work , for example , it won ' t put Netflix on my short list of apps . If it ' s time to commute , travel apps may get a more prominent billing .
