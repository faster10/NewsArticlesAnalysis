There is a gender gap as well ? and not the one that favors Clinton among baby boomer women . Men under 35 ? support Sanders by 4 percentage points . Women back him ? by almost 20 points . The possibility of breaking new ground by electing the first female president apparently carries less persuasive power among younger women than their mothers generation . Stone is ready to support Clinton , though she prefers Sanders . He s actually talking about breaking up the big banks and helping income inequality , she says , and given that I m currently unemployed , income inequality is pretty important .
