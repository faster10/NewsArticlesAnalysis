Jurgen Klopp , the Liverpool manager , is in the midst of an injury crisis at Anfield with Daniel Sturridge , Danny Ings and Divock Origi all out . January is a notoriously challenging time to do business of this magnitude so the Reds offer for Shakhtar Donetsk forward Alex Teixeira should be commended . Scoring 15 goals in just 22 appearances for the Ukrainian outfit , Liverpool have already failed with two offers , worth ? 24 . 5m and ? 28m respectively , as the transfer window hurtles along . Expect Klopp to go in with a late bid before deadline day .
