President Obama , back in 2009 , found himself in hot water for giving voice to a different version of American exceptionalism : " I believe in American exceptionalism , just as I suspect that the Brits believe in British exceptionalism and the Greeks believe in Greek exceptionalism . " ( Obama went on to say : " I am enormously proud of my country and its role and history in the world . . . a nd I think that we have a core set of values that are enshrined in our Constitution , in our body of law , in our democratic practices , in our belief in free speech and equality that , though imperfect , are exceptional .
