A . J . Green was the star of the show on Sunday , which was fitting because he joined a very exclusive club in the win . Green had 128 receiving yards against the Browns , which puts him over 1 , 000 yards for the season ( 1 , 037 ) . Green is now only the second player in NFL history to start a career with five straight 1 , 000 yards seasons . Andy Dalton also made history . Dalton ' s 220 yards passing put him over 3 , 000 on the season ( 3 , 191 ) , making Daytime Dalton and Peyton Manning the only two quarterbacks ever to hit the 3 , 000 yard mark in their first five seasons .
