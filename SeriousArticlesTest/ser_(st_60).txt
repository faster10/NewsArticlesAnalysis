The Eagles ' secondary caught a break last week in a matchup with an injury ravaged Patriots wide receiver corps , but that won ' t be the case in Week 14 . Watkins has turned it on down the stretch now that the Bills are making a concerted effor to get him the football . Over his past two games , Watkins has racked up nine receptions for 267 yards and three touchdowns . The Eagles have struggled to defend opposing No . 1 wide receivers all season , dating back to an early matchup against the Falcons ' Julio Jones , and their aggressive scheme deserves some of the blame . The Eagles cannot take an aggressive approach in this matchup , leaving one of their cornerbacks in one on one coverage with Watkins on the outside . Shading a safety over the top of Watkins on every play is the only way to keep him in check .
