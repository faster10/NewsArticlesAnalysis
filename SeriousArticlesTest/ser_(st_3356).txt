In Week 10 , an injury to starting inside linebacker Keenan Robinson forced reserve linebacker Will Compton into a starting role . Robinson had struggled all year his 15 missed tackles are the second most of any inside linebacker . In his place , Compton helped the Redskins shut down the run game and keep Drew Brees limited to 14 points . That wasn ' t the only defensive change the Redskins made . Deangelo Hall ( toe ) returned to action , but the Redskins decided to use him primarily at free safety instead of cornerback . The decision was met with immediate success . Although Robinson has return to practice this week , the Redskins would be wise to utilize both defensive changes against in Week 11 .
