There always is a transition period , you know ? Because unfortunately these great quarterbacks get older . Really , what I was drawing off and have been drawing off , is my experience in my career as ? the older I got that , OK , when we won those two Super Bowls ? what was the formula ? The formula was to play good defense , and offensively , it was about running the ball . The mindset to me is , we play for 60 minutes . Even though we haven t consistently played well for 60 minutes but , you know , our mindset has been there . That s why this team is a tougher team , because it s a mentally tough team .
