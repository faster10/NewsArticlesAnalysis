Indian generic companies are able to produce affordable drugs not because India does not have a robust patent regime but because of clauses that prevent extension of patents on ambiguous grounds . Before the WTO agreement on drug patents came into effect in 2005 , India only granted process and not product patents on medicines . This meant Indian companies could manufacture low cost generic versions of drugs patented elsewhere using different processes . However , while amending the law to bring it in line with WTO requirement to grant product patents , Indian Parliament ensured that evergreening of patents by drugs companies was prevented .
