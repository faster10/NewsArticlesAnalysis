Don ' t expect to sleep ( much ) . If you ' re making last minute plans to go to Pamplona , don ' t be surprised if you can ' t find a bed . My friends and I didn ' t even try . It seems like everyone sleeps outside in public places , or doesn ' t sleep at all . In fact , Pamplona is the only place where I ' ve ever slept in a public park . I brought a foldable sleeping bag in my backpack handy , since northern Spanish nights can get cold but most people just lay on the grass , huddled together to stay warm . If you go this route , hang on tightly to your belongings . I used my purse as a pillow , but at least one person from my group had his backpack swiped while he was asleep .
