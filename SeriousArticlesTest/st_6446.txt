The blog expanded to include an online boutique last year , placing Metcalfe at the center of a growing movement to reclaim what fashion labels " Native American . " She ' s surrounded by a group of passionate Native designers , artists , stylists , photographers and bloggers who have already proven that by raising their voices they can hold companies accountable . Instead of just reacting to controversies , Metcalfe and her cohorts want to promote authentic examples of modern Native fashion . Their work reflects the diversity of North America ' s indigenous communities , from the southeastern United States to Canada ' s Pacific Northwest , but their message is clear : True Native fashion is more than what ' s for sale at Urban Outfitters or Forever 21 .
