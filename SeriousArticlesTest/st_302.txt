Courtney Barnett , an Australian indie rock favorite , is nice to see in the Best New Artist category . The Internet ' s " Ego Death , " one of the year ' s best underground R B albums , deserves to be alongside the Weeknd and Miguel in Best Urban Contemporary Album ? a category basically invented to give Internet pals Frank Ocean more Grammys , if dude would get around to dropping another album . Lianne La Havas ' " Blood " is a fine pick here , too , though it should also be contending in Best Alternative Music Album .
