A Sanders sweep ? possible , albeit still not probable at this point ? would fundamentally alter the Democratic race . In the span of eight days , the self styled democratic socialist would be transformed from establishment gadfly to real life Democratic challenger . The political press , long desperate for intrigue and uncertainty in a race that has so far been devoid of it , would shower Sanders with attention and praise while simultaneously questioning whether Hillary Clinton was doomed to suffer the same fate she did in 2008 at the hands of another unlikely challenger . ( Expect every talking head on cable TV to remind you in unison that only once in modern political history has a nominee from either party failed to win either of the first two states ? a stat that sounds rather ominous until you consider the non incumbent sample size . ) Bernie , in turn , would see a bump in the polls and an uptick in his fundraising , all at a time when many would be primary voters are paying attention to the 2016 campaign for the first time . All this would be a big deal for Sanders .
