Too much pressure on Aaron Rodgers literally and figuratively . Rodgers , big time leader and all , once told me that he ? expects and accepts pressure as part of his job . So that mindset won ' t change . But too much around him has broken down most notably the loss of Jordy Nelson to stretch the field and the lack of a consistent running game . And without Nelson , the other wideouts who complemented the deep threat , have been better covered by defenses who need not worry about Jordy . Then there ' s that other form of pressure . During his MVP season last year , Rodgers was one of the five least pressured quarterbacks in the NFL . That was reflective of good pressure , Rodgers ' rhythm to get rid of the ball quickly and having a complete offense . This season , the only quarterback in the NFL who has been under more duress this season is Russell Wilson . What a huge difference , which plays out with Rodgers , bless him , trying to extend too many plays while escaping the rush . Hey , this is what makes Rodgers special . There ' s no better quarterback in the NFL for improvising and stinging a defense for a big play . But all of that greatness , that ' s no way to run a consistent offense . The improv plays need to happen occasionally , not on every other throw .
