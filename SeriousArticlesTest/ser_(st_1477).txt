This is why the top five selling albums in 2011 were all experimental in their own right . " 21 " dominated the end of the year chart with 5 . 82 million copies sold . The second top charting album , while also pop , was a seasonal album ( Michael Buble , " Christmas " ) and did not offer any competition to " 21 " with only 2 . 45 million copies sold . While Lady Gaga had already established herself as a pop music icon with her studio album debut and EP ( " The Fame " , " The Fame Monster " ) , her 2011 follow up , " Born This Way , " saw Last Gaga broadening her musical style and ultimately straying away from the dance pop style she had become known for . With such effort however , " Born This Way " showed a decrease of over 2 million records in U . S . album sales when compared to the 2008 " The Fame " and only sold 2 . 1 million records . The fourth and fifth top selling albums of 2011 both sold under 2 million records with rapper Lil Wayne ' s " Tha Carter IV " only moving 1 . 92 million copies and country ' s Jason Aldean ' s album " My Kinda Party " only selling 1 . 58 million copies .
