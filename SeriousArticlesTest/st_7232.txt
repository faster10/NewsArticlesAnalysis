After agonizing for a few nights over how to handle it all , I told my son that he needed to change his settings to private so pedophiles and other " creepy people " can ' t follow his posts . He ' s a clever kid and understood that I was on to him . It was an unspoken acknowledgment that I had seen what he was putting out there . So he ' s gone private . The settings are locked . I asked if I could follow him on Instagram and he immediately said no .
