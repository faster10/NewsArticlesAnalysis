I don t know how people stay in there for three months on the regular version , it s insane . It just started to feel weird and the whole thing with Tiffany and Angie happened , the whole house was completely upside down . He s walking around being very pompous and righteous and stuff and I just really didn t like his energy . John mentioned Darren s smoking ? which he had quit before taking part in the reality TV show ? and how withdrawn he s become .
