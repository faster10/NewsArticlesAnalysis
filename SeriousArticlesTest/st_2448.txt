Directed by Darrell Roodt and produced in South Africa , " Lullaby " makes no sense in any way except one : Leo ' s performance does . The " Homicide " and " Frozen River " actress soldiers through this thing with dogged commitment , as if she doesn ' t know where her next meal is coming from . If that means taking a gig shooting in the sleaziest crime neighborhood in Jo ' burg , well , it ' s still better to play a waitress than be one .
