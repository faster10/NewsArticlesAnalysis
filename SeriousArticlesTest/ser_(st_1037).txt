ANALYSIS ABC s RICK KLEIN : They re the numbers Bernie Sanders has been waiting for ? but might they have come two weeks or so too early ? New polling showing Sanders in striking distance in Iowa , and slightly ahead in New Hampshire , reveals why Hillary Clinton is on the attack ? suddenly even doing phone interviews if it means a chance to take on Sanders on guns . In a new ad and a sharpened stump , Clinton is also falling back on the e word ? electability ? in making her case to wavering ( or at least uninspired ) Democrats . The attack may slightly miss the mark , given the fact that national and state level polling suggest that a less defined Sanders is a stronger matchup against Donald Trump than is Clinton . But those numbers could turn around fast if scrutiny falls on Sanders . His supporters may be fired up and ready to go a bit harder and faster given the Clinton attacks . Clinton , though , still has ample time to ramp up her machine , which also may work better fueled by some fear . If Sanders stays in the mix in the early states and beyond , he won t have the element of surprise on his side .
