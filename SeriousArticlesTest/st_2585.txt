One of these projects includes IMG World of Adventure , which has a soft launch scheduled for December as part of the City of Arabia residential and commercial development . It plans to usurp Ferrari World as the world ' s largest indoor theme park , and will include four zones , which , separately , would be a massive undertaking . Perhaps the most unique is The Lost Valley , a Jurassic themed segment that will include animatronic dinosaurs . Two other zones are dedicated to the characters of Marvel Comics and Cartoon Network .
