With his cut glass cheekbones , artfully mussed hair , and Mick Jagger wardrobe , Scott Weiland looks like the Platonic ideal of a rock star . And indeed , he has the album sales ( 35 million worldwide ) , the hits ( 15 top 10 singles since 1992 , including six number ones ) , and attendant bad habits ( a well documented cycle of addiction , arrests , rehabs , and relapses ) to back it up . As he stands distractedly in the dim anteroom of his Burbank studio , the whippet thin frontman sounds the part , too . Man , I am so fried , he murmurs , rubbing his jaw with ringed fingers . I can t believe I m standing right now .
