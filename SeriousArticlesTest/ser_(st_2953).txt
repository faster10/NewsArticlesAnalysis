Prior to this eruption ? in fact , prior to Rampling ' s nomination ? many Americans probably had little awareness of who the distinguished actress even is or was . Most recently they might have spotted her as a psychiatrist on Showtime ' s Dexter . She also turns up in the new BBC America series London Spy . Her best performances ( many of them in obscure French movies ) are emotionally reserved but somehow rich , haunted by an air of sadness , doubt , trouble and anger . 45 Years , in which she plays a woman who realizes that her husband has lied about his true feelings all through their long marriage , could be said to be Rampling distilled to her essence . The whole film , in a sense , hinges on a simple , unexpected gesture she makes at the end .
