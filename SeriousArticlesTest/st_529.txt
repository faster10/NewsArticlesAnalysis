I can t speak for this government . I have nothing to do with their policies , I don t know what s on their mind . Nor can I speak about whether they have pre negotiated or have reason to believe that Pakistan will deliver on their promises . I m talking not just about ( punishing ) 26 11 perpetrators but actually acting against terrorism and the groups that attack us , opening up Wagah to more goods , etc . So if you ask me , honestly , today I cannot say whether the optics will actually result in the substance but it would be very unusual for any government to just do the optics without any assurances . So I am quite happy to be surprised .
