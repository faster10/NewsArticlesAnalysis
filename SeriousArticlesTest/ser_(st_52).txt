I learned a lot from Bill . No doubt about it , O Brien said this week . One thing I learn is you really can t leave any stone unturned . For instance , if you re getting ready for a regular season game you may look at the last three or four games , or maybe you go back and look at a common opponent . But in this instance , you re looking at all the games . You re looking at all the snaps . You re looking for any edge that you can find to try to put your players in the best position to make plays .
