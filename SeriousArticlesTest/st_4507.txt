Patient interest should come first . It should be at the core of any policy . Making drugs affordable is particularly important because older drugs are failing due to drug resistance ( one of the reasons for which is people not completing full course because drugs are unaffordable in the first place ) . The African people too are looking for an assurance from India that it will continue to be a provider of affordable medicines for its people . Saving lives through cheaper medicines would be the biggest diplomatic dividend . ?
