Yet , as the FFF have hinted ? whether out of simple defiance or a less coherent cocktail of emotions ? sport does have some role to play . Albeit the same role every form of peaceable human activity takes on in response . Football , in particular , likes nothing better than trumpeting its own importance , from the overblown drama of triumph and defeat to the cynical appropriation of the language of diplomacy by the sport s administrative bodies . Handshakes of peace , football across the barricades , the sickly and oleaginous posturings of the Fifa Football Family . All of this looks ever more ludicrous .
