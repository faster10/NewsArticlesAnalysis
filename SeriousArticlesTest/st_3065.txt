" The statute itself is so broad as . . . to be meaningless , " Goldman said . " It prohibits the use of any chemical weapon . And what ' s a chemical weapon ? It ' s any object , any item that has toxic chemicals . If in the case of an angry spouse throwing a can of Ajax " a bleach based cleaner " at his wife , or vice versa , that would be considered to be use of a chemical weapon and the terrorism statute would apply . I can ' t imagine that the people that were involved in the treaty would anticipate such a broad application . "
