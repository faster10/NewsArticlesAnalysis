The woman known to her family as Betty struck back by putting her science training to ill use . The 42 year old stole a dangerous chemical arsenic based 10 chloro 10H phenoxarsine , to be exact from her company , and obtained potassium dichromate over the Internet .

She then tried to poison Haynes some two dozen times over several months , secretly sprinkling the chemicals on an apartment doorknob , car door handles , and a mailbox .
