Both special teams units have been far from perfect despite providing some memorable moments this season . Jalen Watts Jackson ' s muffed punt return against Michigan and Michael Geiger ' s game winning field goal at Ohio State changed the Spartans season . The return units and Geiger , though , were both prone to costly mistakes throughout the year . Marshall Koehn ' s 57 yard field goal to beat Pittsburgh kept Iowa s perfect season rolling . He hit 13 of his 17 attempts this season , which gives the Hawkeyes a slight edge in this category .
