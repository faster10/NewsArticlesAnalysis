Ruah : I do go online a lot . I was given some advice by co star and " Scent of a Woman " actor Chris O ' Donnell . He was like , " Be careful , you ' re going to start buying items that you love and then you ' ll put them all together and realize nothing goes together , " so what I did was buy a couple of pieces that I love and now I ' m going to get a decorator to help me tie everything together .
