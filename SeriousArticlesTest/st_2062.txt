Hutchins s 12 year reign is remembered as a largely jolly time by those who were there . But after his resignation in 1987 , the comedy turned rather darker , and the belly laughs were mostly at Great Britain s expense . The slide began in his final matches , when the team suffered successive defeats by Mexico and Yugoslavia that sent them plunging out of the World Group for the first time in their history . I remember some headlines saying Hutchins must go , he remembers now , but I always felt I got on well with the press . Before the start of the Mexico tie , Andrew Castle announced publicly that we were going to crush them , and I had to have a quiet word and ask the reporters not to run the story ? for everyone s benefit . Amazingly , they all obliged . It probably was for the best , as we lost 5 0 anyway .
