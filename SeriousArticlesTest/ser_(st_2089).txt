We re going to start to have to look at how the Democratic candidates play against Donald Trump , because he s certainly holding onto his lead in the Republican Party , and he has certainly played the Republican candidates in a way that has hurt some of his opposition , and I think people are going to start asking , All right , who s going to stand up under his type of campaigning ? Mr Allen said . If Bernie Sanders is the candidate , Trump will play up how un American socialism is , and if Hillary gets it , he will dig up everything in the past 40 years and use it ? and won t mince words in using it .
