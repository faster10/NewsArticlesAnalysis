In my honest opinion , we will see Glenn alive and in the present day again , but he won ' t stay that way for long . What I think is going to happen is that Glenn is actually going to be saved by the Wolves , specifically Negan . ? Someone among them will recognize Glenn as being from Alexandria and when they attack again , Negan will reveal Glenn to be alive , have his infamous confrontation with Rick , and proceed to recreate Glenn ' s death from the comics . I could be wrong on this , but that ' s what I think is going to happen . The TWD writers and showrunners have never left the fate of a character to ambiguity , yet Glenn ' s " death " fell right in that category ' s lap . We never actually see Glenn get killed .
