But Occupy is anything but a protest movement . That ' s why it has been so hard for news agencies to express or even discern the " demands " of the growing legions of Occupy participants around the nation , and even the world . Just like pretty much everyone else on the planet , occupiers may want many things to happen and other things to stop , but the occupation is not about making demands . They don ' t want anything from you , and there is nothing you can do to make them stop . That ' s what makes Occupy so very scary and so very promising . It is not a protest , but a prototype for a new way of living .
