Former major leaguer Leonard is on the short list that Murphy now tops . In the 1987 National League Championship Series , Leonard , playing for the San Francisco Giants , hit home runs in four consecutive games . Leonard says all good hitters try to drive the bat through the hitting zone , keeping the head of the bat flat and on the same plane , or path , as the incoming pitch . He compares the action to slicing a banana in half , horizontally . In Murphy ' s case , Leonard says , it ' s like he ' s slicing two long bananas .
