One of the theories on why Carson can t win ? besides the fact that he s utterly loopy ? is that even a lot of Republican voters will be unnerved by his plans to undermine Social Security and Medicare . But his ideas aren t actually all that different from those of most of the other candidates , who want to raise retirement rates or cut out everybody under , say , 45 . It s not too much to ask of our generation after everything our parents and our grandparents did for us , said Rubio .
