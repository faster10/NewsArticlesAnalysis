Yost and his friends take hunting seriously . Foxworthy converted a grain silo on his property into a cylindrical lodge , with bedrooms and a kitchen and a big screen television . One week a year , a group gets together for target practice and a few laughs , cooking spaghetti one night , steak the next , and thinking about little more than the behavior , needs and tendencies of deer . Maybe 20 yards from the silo s front door is Man Land , a shed that has been outfitted with lockers and name plates ? they call Yost Steady , because his mood doesn t often change ? with a giant trophy room in the rear . There s an alligator a friend killed with a bow , and a stag Foxworthy brought home from New Zealand . There are rows of mounted heads and a case of arrowheads , gathered from both properties . But the prize for this year is near a wall , a 10 point buck , freshly mounted .
