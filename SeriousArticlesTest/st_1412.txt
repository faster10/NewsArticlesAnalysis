Is that too picky ? Perhaps , but you wouldn ' t find Pixar playing so fast and loose with the laws of physics , and that kind of inattention to detail is typical of the lackadaisical storytelling here and in other Dreamworks animated features . ( The talent pool for this one includes the directors of " Shrek 2 " and " Shark Tale " and the writers of " Kung Fu Panda " and " The Rocker , " incidentally . ) High concepts , top notch voice talent and scattershot pop cultural references are no compensation for a coherent script .
