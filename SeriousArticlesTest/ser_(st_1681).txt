The tougher question is whether Craig is so good an actor that he has inadvertently hurt the series . Even in a cultural era obsessed with moral complexity , it s hard to imagine that the mood of the franchise would have gotten quite so dark or that there would have been quite so hard a push to make its protagonist more complicated if an actor of Brosnan s limited abilities had stayed in the role . Craig has recently declared his annoyance at having to play Bond ? the orneriness that he shows onscreen doesn t seem entirely a matter of acting ? and so it s possible that Spectre will be his last outing . Whenever people talk about who the next Bond will be , the discussion tends to focus on Idris Elba .
