Regardless of Charlie Hebdo , it was clear that they have less tolerance for hate speech in their society than we do in the United States . They have less tolerance for disparaging words against marginalized groups of people than we do in the United States . They do not confuse hate speech with freedom of speech as often as we do here in the United States . This is similar to what I have learned about our neighbors to the north Canada when I published an article in a Canadian newspaper . They were quick to edit anything I wrote that could be deemed defamatory like if I were to call an Islamophobe known for spreading hate , a " bigot . " Eye opening .
