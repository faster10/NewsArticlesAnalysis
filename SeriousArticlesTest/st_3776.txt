Barack Obama is blowing past all signs of caution on the left lanes of the road of American politics . That s a dog bites man headline that by now is common knowledge . He no longer cares what Americans think of his leadership . His my way or the highway handling of the Syrian refugee crisis , which could endanger the homeland , seals it . Though he gave Iran s stony faced mullahs all they wanted and more in his nuclear deal , he has dispensed with even pretending to accommodate the concerns to several governors in his scheme to settle thousands of foreign refugees on their soil . Flinging insults is more fun .
