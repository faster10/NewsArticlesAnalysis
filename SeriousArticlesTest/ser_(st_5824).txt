So far , US led air strikes and Russian intervention have not altered the military balance and the war is still sucking in new participants . While Britain was agonising over its very limited intervention last week , a Turkish battalion with tanks suddenly turned up outside Mosul in northern Iraq . The Iraqi government said it had not invited them in and asked them to leave . They are in a camp used by Sunni Arabs and former police in the city , who belong to a private army raised by the former local governor , Atheel al Nujaifi , who fled when Isis ? captured it . This means that one more army has entered the conflict . ?
