Said Daniel Murphy , the MVP of the National League Championship Series : " I ' ve watched them , obviously , in the playoffs this year . And last year we had plenty of time to watch them . And so it ' s a really good club . The term I would use for them , they seem relentless . They never stop coming . What a great characteristic to have for a ballclub . So it should be a great series . What a great opponent to play . "
