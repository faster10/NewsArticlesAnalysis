Angela Fritz of Fort Hood , Texas " Having my husband gone is the worst kind of pain . It is the burden I chose to bear but am not happy to . On the outside , I have to stand strong . I have to support my country and my husband , regardless of what I feel . That is the Army way . I am so proud of him for having the courage to step up and serve his country . On the inside , I am angry and worn thin . Of course , I want my husband home , but it ' s so much more than that now . "
