With the game tied 49 49 , fourth down , 20 seconds left and the clock stopped following an incomplete pass , the Giants had the ball at their own 25 yard line and sent Brad Wing in to punt . Rather than punt it out of bounds to deny any chance at a return , Wing punted the ball to Marcus Murphy , who returned it 24 yards to the Giants ' 47 . Murphy fumbled the ball , but Saints receiver Willie Snead recovered and , as he was trying to advance it , Wing was called for a face mask penalty while tackling him . Since you can ' t advance a fumble , the penalty was enforced from the 47 and the Saints were able to snap the ball from the 32 and kick the 50 yard field goal to win it .
