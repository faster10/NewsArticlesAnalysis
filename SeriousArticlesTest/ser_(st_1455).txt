In 1988 , Phil Hartman and Jan Hooks appeared as Ivana and Donald in " A Trump Christmas . " The sketch uses the couple ' s outlandish opulence to spoof " The Gift of the Magi , " a short story about the lengths two poor spouses go to to give each other Christmas presents . " I went to Tiffany ' s and bought diamonds by the yard for a garland , " Ivana says as the pair sips champagne in front of their Monet adorned fireplace . Hartman hadn ' t come anywhere near nailing Trump ' s trademark accent or gesticulations , but the sketch did perfectly land the privileged family ' s utter disconnect from the experiences of average Americans .
