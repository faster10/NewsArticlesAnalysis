First , the ? business side . Since the invention of video cameras , media rights holders ? have licensed content ? through a series of national deals . Until streaming came along , this made sense , because cable companies don t operate on a worldwide scale . In the age of the Internet ? though , it leads to odd situations . ?

Star Wars fans lucky ? enough to live in Canada will be ? able to stream The Force Awakens .
