Upstage , the Color Guard enters , connecting the two lines at the top . They face the crowd directly The Color Sargent and The Color Bearer , flanked by two riflemen . Under the hot lights , the Stars and Stripes are radiant , and the Marine Battle Standard glows like a crimson beacon .

To watch , as events unfold around you .
