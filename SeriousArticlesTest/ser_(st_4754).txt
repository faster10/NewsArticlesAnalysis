It ' s worth noting that Wade had a great deal of help on that final offensive possession , because the Thunder defense bailed him out with the foul when he appeared to have nothing close to a good look . Unfortunately for OKC , that mistake typified their late game execution . One of the league ' s most talent rich offenses managed only eight points in the final six minutes as the attack devolved into isolation attempts and a set of half formed ideas . The very good Heat defense deserves praise , but the Thunder fired head coach Scott Brooks last spring in part because they wanted a more varied offense in crunch time . It ' s still early , but Billy Donovan looks behind schedule .
