We ' ll hear a ton this week about the Patriots losing two in a row , but we all know deep down they ' ll be fine . The problem is the rest of the AFC . The Patriots don ' t control if they get the No . 1 seed anymore , and if they drop any more games they might end up with the No . 3 seed . Then they ' d have to win in the first playoff weekend ( against Pittsburgh ? ) and then win at Cincinnati and Denver in back to back weeks to make the Super Bowl . That would be tough , to say the least .
