Much like their offensive teammates , the defense made one play that cost them dearly . On a first down play , Wilson had the snap go through his hands and over his shoulder while trying to direct the Seahawks offense . The quarterback slid to secure the ball around his own 45 yard line and avoided a blitzing Captain Munnerlyn . Wide receiver Tyler Lockett was left alone over the middle of the field , made the catch and ran inside the Vikings five yard line . ? Had Munnerlyn taken a better angle to the quarterback or if Josh Robinson had stayed with Lockett , the game could have ended differently .
