Another thing that ' s bugging me is the fact that Scott Gimple actually took the time to prepare a statement concerning Glenn , something he ' s never done before . Basically he said , we will see Glenn again this season as his story has yet to be wrapped up . Again , every character that has died has done so at the end of their respective story , but Glenn ' s story has yet to be finished ? Sure Gimple could be simply telling us that we ' re only going to be seeing Glenn in flashbacks , which is something they ' ve said are going to be happening a lot this season , but the fact that he said that Glenn ' s story is not finished makes me think that Glenn somehow found a way to escape . It wouldn ' t be the first time he ' s done so .
