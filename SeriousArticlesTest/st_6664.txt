To avoid getting carsick keep your head up as much as possible . Point out the beautiful scenery outside because it ' s moving with you , so that ' s a good thing . Get as much fresh air as much as possible . Try not to eat any particularly spicy foods , especially when you ' re on road trips . Blander , drier foods , those are going to be good things . Soda water is a really good thing , clear sodas if possible . Heat tends to worsen the symptoms , so if it ' s too hot to have the windows open and you can afford to have your air conditioning on these days , try and run your air a little bit . And get the kids and elderly people in particular out of the car as much as possible . Get them on terra firma from time to time , that also helps .
