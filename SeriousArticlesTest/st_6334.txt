Manning then went three and out . Brady moved the Patriots from their 29 to the Denver 14 , where they faced a fourth and 6 with 2 : 25 left . If Belichick had kicked the field goal on the previous series , he could have kicked it again now , cutting the lead to two points with three timeouts and the two minute warning to help him . But now he had to go for it . Brady threw incomplete to Rob Gronkowski and once again Manning went three and out and Brady took over at his 50 with 1 : 52 left .
