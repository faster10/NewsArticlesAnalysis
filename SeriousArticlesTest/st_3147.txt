Rihanna films the video for her hit We Found Love in a field in County Down , Northern Ireland , in September 2011 . The farmer who owned the field asked the star and her crew to leave his property after deeming her bikini an " inappropriate state of undress " . They left , but not until they had been advised to " be acquainted with God and to consider his son , the Lord Jesus Christ , and his death and Resurrection . " The British press , naturally , had a field day . ?
