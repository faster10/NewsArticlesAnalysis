That ' s what Jones meant when he called Hardy a leader and excused his run in with special teams coach Rich Bisaccia . Jones would rather stand in a mosh pit of reporters answering questions about character and discipline than he would having to explain repeated losses . That was on his face Sunday night . Similar to each of the previous weeks , that lonesome skybox stare . You can ' t imagine a billionaire ever looking so lost . But Jones is in that space right now . He knows he needs Romo back , as soon as possible . Maybe as soon as Week 11 against the Miami Dolphins . Until then , he knows the fate of the team is now hanging on others falling flat on their faces .
