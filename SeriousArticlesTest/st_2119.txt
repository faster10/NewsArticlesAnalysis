Morgenstern : It ' s been fun , but it does seem very big , especially for my first book . There are days where it ' s just a little overwhelming , but the response has been great , especially within the book industry . I ' ve been getting letters from booksellers saying how much they love my story it means so much to me . After all the bells and whistles and Comic Con , and all the big stuff , really the fact that individual people are reading it and loving the book is just the best thing . One of the nicest things I ' ve heard , though , I ' ve had a couple people say to me this is not a book for everyone , which I really like , because I don ' t particularly think there are books for everyone . I think this is the sort of story that resonates particularly strong with certain people and maybe not as much with others . I think that ' s a hallmark of a really good story that it has readers that it speaks to more than others .
