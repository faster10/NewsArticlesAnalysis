Mary McNamara , at the Los Angeles Times , wondered why Woods bothered to make the statement , saying it just " reignited " the news cycle : " . . . it would have been nice if Woods had seemed more genuine the only real emotion he seemed to be experiencing was anger at the media , and a general air of irritated resignation at having to make this statement in the first place . Which , of course , he did not . The world would have gone on turning without a prepared statement from Tiger Woods . But unless Woods is planning to retire , to embrace a truly private life , then going out there with a ' I ' m saying this and then I ' m not saying anything more ' is just ridiculous and disingenuous .
