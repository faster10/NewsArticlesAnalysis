Cam never dances when they are losing . I ve watched ever panthers game for 5 years and the biggest misconception is that he dances when they are down . Frankly if you ve watched the panthers over the last 5 years , you d know that they have some kind of record of letting leads go . Even in their 6 10 and 7 9 season , the panthers were leading in nearly every game and lost it at the end . It wasn t until last season that they started finishing games . If I am lying , give me one example of Cam being down in points and dancing ? I challenge anyone to find one instance and post it here
