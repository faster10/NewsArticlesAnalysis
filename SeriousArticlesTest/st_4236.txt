Perhaps Romney really doesn ' t remember the assault on John Lauber nearly a half century ago , despite the fact that so many of the other people who were there have never forgotten it . Or perhaps he decided that claiming ignorance would be the safest course of crisis management . But what he said told people nothing about the man he is today and how he has changed and grown over that time . We ' re all different people than we were in our youth , and we all have regrets . The 17 year old Mitt Romney may have been a privileged , entitled boy with a mean streak . The 65 year old Mitt Romney missed an opportunity to convince us he ' s something different .
