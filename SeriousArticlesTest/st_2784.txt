Phelps has been training for the 2016 Summer Olympics at a pool near campus , as his personal coach now heads up the Sun Devils team , as well . So someone in the 942 Crew had the brilliant idea to recruit the perennial gold medal winner to grab his speedo , hardware and swim cap and come on down to the Wells Fargo Arena for a good ol Pac 12 basketball game . Per Yahoo Sports , Phelps was more than happy to help out , and had a good time doing so .
