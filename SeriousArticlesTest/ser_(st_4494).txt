" The ones where you say , ' I need to do this . I can ' t sleep if I don ' t do this . I can ' t do anything else , ' those are the ones with the most chance of being successful . I love working with people who don ' t care about the money , who don ' t care about the danger of failing , who just go for it . That ' s what made me do it . Fearless people are the best to hang around with . "
