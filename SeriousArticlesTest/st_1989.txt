" I initially disagreed with this line of thinking . Charges of " renting a womb " and exploitation have long tarnished the practice of surrogacy . But in my mind , a woman going through the risks of labor for another family clearly deserves to be paid . To me , this was not exploitation . This was a win win , allowing the surrogate to have a brighter future and the couple to have a child . If my money was going to bene t an Indian woman nancially for a service she willingly provided , I preferred that it be a poor woman who really needed help because the money that a surrogate earns in India is , to be blunt , life changing .
