Governments break promises and disappoint if they have been in office for a long time , and that mood affects voters ' choices when they are asked to endorse the same government ' s recommendations on Europe . In Denmark , for example , a conservative government had been in power for 10 years by the time it held a vote to approve the EU ' s Maastricht Treaty , in 1992 , contributing to the proposal ' s rejection . A year later , a new government headed by Social Democrat Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen was able to capitalize on the post election honeymoon it was enjoying to win a re run of the same vote . It was passage of the Maastricht Treaty that enabled the euro ' s creation and formally established the European Union .
