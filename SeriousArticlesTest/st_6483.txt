My opinion is eventually we get to the point where at least in post season , replay is used only when a run would be affected . So if there ' s a runner on third , and on an infield chopper , a guy looks like he is safe but they call him out , I think that would be reviewable since a run was scored . A trapped ball with two outs and a man on third would be the same thing . Those are the kind of things that could really affect the outcome of a game and would be a reviewable component if a run crosses home plate . That ' s why they do it for a home run , because a run is affected .
