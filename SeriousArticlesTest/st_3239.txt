On the Panthers injury list are two of their top three cornerbacks , Charles Tillman and Bene Benwikere . They were replaced by Robert McClain and Courtland Finnegan , who were on the street when the Panthers called . ( Finnegan hasn t played a full season since 2012 . ) With Seattle s offensive line providing better protection ( center Patrick Lewis was making just his first start , and got hurt , in the previous Panthers game ) , Carolina has reason to be concerned about another big Russell Wilson to Doug Baldwin day .
