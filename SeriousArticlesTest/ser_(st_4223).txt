I think just knowing how the process of weeks are , you want it to be as normal as possible , Romo said . At the same time , it s not in the best interest in the torque you put on your back to go four out of five days , plus coming back on a short week , getting ready to go next week on Thanksgiving . You re going to end up throwing the football , putting that torque on consistently , a hair too much if you push it . We threw a little bit earlier in the week . I did a lot , so I think it was in the best interest of getting ready to play in this game .
