" Me , personally , I ' m not going to let anybody have their way , " Morris said . " It could be the worst player , good player . Nobody will ever have their way with me on the court . If I ' ve got to foul out , you ' re not going to have your way with me . You might make some tough shots , and it ' s going to be tough , but we ' re all pros , we ' re all good players , best league in the world , so it happens .
