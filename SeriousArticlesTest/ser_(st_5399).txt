I am told that the initial reaction in the Kremlin to Obama ' s plan to fight ISIS was not exactly a kind one . The suspicion was that Washington , together with its allies , was planning to use the campaign against ISIS in Syria to dispose of Assad through the back door , so to speak . An anti terrorist operation targeted at ISIS " gets out of control " and all sorts of wrong targets get hit , like , say , Syrian army positions . One thing leads to another and , lo and behold , we have Assad going down the route of Colonel Gadhafi , and Syria descends into the same kind of chaos that is now gripping Libya . But after the " border " between Ukraine and Syria emerged all of a sudden , that attitude is changing .
