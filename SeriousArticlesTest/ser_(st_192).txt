Not only is Bryant having his worst statistical season , but his inability to even create scoring opportunities for himself brings to mind memories of Willie Mays struggling at the end of his memorable career . Bryant was never the most efficient NBA player ? unlike Michael Jordan and LeBron James , two players he s often compared to , he never shot above . 500 in a single season ( his career high was . 469 and he has started this season shooting . 305 ) . But at his peak , Bryant was an aesthetic marvel who regularly took fans breaths away with singular displays of athleticism . Now , the image of him needing multiple screens and countless pump fakes just to get a shot off suggests that it might have behooved Bryant to retire long before he became a shell of the explosive player who wore No . 8 and helped carry one of the most dominant NBA teams of all time . ?
