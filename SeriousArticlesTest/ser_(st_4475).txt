The biggest threat in 2016 is not a recession ? which can t be ruled out , but is not likely it is further damage to the American dream . The president will continue executive action we just can t be sure how much burdensome red tape will result . And there is the real damage that short termism will rear its ugly head among the 2016 presidential candidates and produce promises of more spending ( the Clinton campaign is already over 1 trillion ) , new entitlements and expensive mandates . That s not the path to fixing the U . S . growth problem .
