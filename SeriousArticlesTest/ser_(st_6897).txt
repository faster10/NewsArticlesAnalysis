" He s a really good coach . Obviously , we talked about it when Lionel ( Hollins ) got fired last week , there s a lot of really good coaches in this league . It s probably not the most secure profession to choose . But David Blatt did a heck of a job and he wont a ton of games . He handled himself , I thought , with great grace all the way through . His team got all the way to the Finals , a team that had to change the way they played to get there . I read his statement afterwards . I stole a play from him that we got an open 3 on the other day . I would think he s not going to be unemployed long . He s a heck of a coach now . "
