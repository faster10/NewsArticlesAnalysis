" The estimated reduction stems almost entirely from a net decline in the amount of labor that workers will choose to supply , rather than from a net drop in businesses ' demand for labor , so it will appear almost entirely as a reduction in labor force participation and in hours worked relative to what would have occurred otherwise rather than as an increase in unemployment ( that is , more workers seeking but not finding jobs ) or underemployment ( such as part time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week ) .
