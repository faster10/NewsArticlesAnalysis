In late 1992 , at Ruby Ridge , Idaho , a standoff between U . S . Marshals and Randy Weaver ' s family resulted in the death of a marshal , a young boy and the boy ' s unarmed mother . And in 1993 , federal agents launched an ill conceived raid on property near Waco , Texas , belonging to the Branch Davidians sect , leading to a bloody shootout and a 51 day standoff , which ended in the death of almost all the Davidians , including a number of children . These incidents infuriated the entire extreme right , which saw them as deliberate attempts by the government to kill American citizens .
