Cosmo : I ' m a dedicated fly fisherman . I fish quite a lot up in Oregon for steelhead . And my fishing buddy who ' s a few years older than me , Bo he hasn ' t read many books in his life . But when I said I ' m doing this thing , " Game of Thrones , " he said , " Oh , man . I ' m going to get these books . " We ' d be standing up to our waist , trying to catch steelhead in the river . . . and he ' d say , " Well , I got to Chapter 23 last night . You ' re still there , kid . "
