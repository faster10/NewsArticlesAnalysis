Spectre is a Bond movie , so you pretty much know what you re going to get . You ve got the gunshot at the camera open , followed by credits full of writhing women ( and a shirtless Daniel Craig , thank you feminism ) , then a big action scene , the dumdadadadumdadada dumdadadaDUMdadada theme song , the presentation of the latest car , then jumping and punching and shooting and creepy , aggressive sexuality ( though both Lea Seydoux as Bond Girl Madeleine Swann and Naomie Harris as Awesome Girl Moneypenny do a lot to mitigate the misogyny , thank you feminism ) .
