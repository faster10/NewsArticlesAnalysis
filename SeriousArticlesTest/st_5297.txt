The Davis Cup victory was the 10th title for Great Britain , but the one time tennis power hadn ' t won the competition since 1936 . The little island nation relied completely on Murray to carry the load throughout the year . How impressive is the World No . 2 ' s accomplishment ? Murray , the U . S . ' John McEnroe and Sweden ' s Mats Wilander are the only players to win all eight possible singles matches in a Davis Cup season since the introduction of the World Group format 34 years ago .

Federer was 6 1 last year during Switzerland ' s title run . ) And like McEnroe back in the day and unlike most top players recently Murray also played doubles , meaning his workload for all but one of Britain ' s three day Cup ties was exhausting .
