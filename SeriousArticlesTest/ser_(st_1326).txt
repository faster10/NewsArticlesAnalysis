What an embarrassing and frustrating event ! A bunch of maritime thugs brazenly seized a vessel flying the flag of the nation with the most powerful navy the world has ever known . The fault does not lie with the ships and sailors of Combined Task Force 151 . They have been given the proverbial mission impossible stop pirate attacks in an area four times the size of Texas with only three U . S . Navy ships and a total of 12 to 15 allied friendly warships . Not gonna happen !
