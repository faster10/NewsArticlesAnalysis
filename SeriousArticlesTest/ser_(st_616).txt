" They need to change it . If they don ' t change it , then we have a problem , " Vali said earlier , adding that " the foam underlay is too soft . It ' s five inches ( 12 . 7 centimeters ) thick , which doesn ' t help a big lad going into a ring . We ' ve never seen canvas like this before . It ' s too much from a health and safety point of view , because he can easily do ( damage ) his ankle . Usually there ' s only a two inch foam , and that ' s it this is between five and six inches .
