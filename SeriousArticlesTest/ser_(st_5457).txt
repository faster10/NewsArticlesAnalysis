After years of trying to identify him , it at last looks like the Seahawks have Marshawn Lynch s eventual replacement on the roster in undrafted rookie running back Thomas Rawls . With Lynch out of the lineup and missing a third game this season , this time due to a lingering abdominal injury , Rawls gave Seattle quite the glimpse of the future , running 30 times for 209 yards in the Seahawks 29 ? 13 win over visiting San Francisco . Rawls also chipped in with 46 yards on three receptions and totaled four gains of at least 20 yards , and now there s no rush to get Lynch back in the lineup . Lynch will reportedly see a specialist in Philadelphia on Monday regarding his abdominal injury .
