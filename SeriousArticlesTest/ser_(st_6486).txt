But while Lohan going the self deprecating route has become expected , the appearance is noteworthy for her candid goofiness . During a segment about a viral video that had a girl singing into a curling iron before grabbing it like a hairbrush and burning her hand , Lohan sympathized . " It ' s so true ! " she explained as she acted it out . But fans shouldn ' t expect to see anything similar on Lohan ' s Twitter . " I would never selfie video myself curling my hair ! That ' s a ' delete ' moment ! " she explained with a laugh .
