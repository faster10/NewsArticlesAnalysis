Arzu Kayaoglu , euronews : We re joined from Paris by Didier Billion , co head of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs ( IRIS ) , a specialist on European and Turkish matters . Thanks for being with us Mr Billion . For a few years , we had almost forgotten the question about Turkey joining the European Union . The negotiations stagnated . Now , suddenly , against the backdrop of the migration crisis , Angela Merkel has put the bid back on the table . Do you find this political opportunism or was it already on the European agenda ?
