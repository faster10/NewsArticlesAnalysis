Katherine Shigekane of Virginia Beach , Virginia " The Iraq war has changed our lives in many ways . My husband has been serving in the Navy for 16 years , and since March 2003 , he has been on four different deployments . Our lives have been affected in many ways . Our wedding plans were changed due to the invasion . He missed most of my first pregnancy . He was able to be home for the birth of our twins but left again when they were a year old and was gone until after their second birthday . He is now gone again . . . . As a family I think we have learned to appreciate the time we do spend together . "
