Ruah : I remember asking my father if he had preferred that I ' d gone into medicine and his exact words were , " Are you crazy ? You have no idea what this lifestyle is like . It ' s a dog style life , being on call , sleeping at the hospital , studying for the rest of your life because of medical developments , it ' s research , it ' s surgery , it ' s such a long time to educate yourself in the field . " I do have a huge fascination for science and I love to hear what my dad has to say . He used to take me into minor surgeries when I was a kid and let me watch , so I definitely have a passion for it , but it ' s not as big a passion as I have for acting and creating characters . From the moment I told them this is what I want to do , they were supportive .
