As African foreign ministers and heads of government troop into the national capital for the latest edition of the India Africa summit and bilateral meetings on the sidelines , thousands of patients of cancer , HIV and other ailments back in the continent are keeping their fingers crossed . The summit is billed as a platform for enhanced economic cooperation and strategic diplomatic move to boost India s bid to get a seat in the United Nations Security Council . But the cause for anxiety of patients and support groups in poor African countries is not diplomacy . They are concerned about the future of India s intellectual property regime , which , till now , has facilitated the flow of affordable medicines to Africa from India . The timing of the summit is critical . It is taking place at a time when India is reviewing its intellectual property policy . It is apprehended that any change in the policy would harm patients in Africa , so African leaders hope to convince India not to change it . The African apprehension has risen because of growing pressure on India from powerful pharmaceutical lobbies of America and Europe to dilute its patents policy . ?
