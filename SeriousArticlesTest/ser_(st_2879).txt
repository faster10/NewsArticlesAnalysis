A : I have no recollection of him at all . He was a person very dedicated to the cause of fighting for India s independence . Of course , my mother told me a number of things about him . Well , she was certainly a biased person in that matter , of course . Given the circumstances , one has to be surprised that she was willing to share her life with a person who was so dedicated to a cause which took him away . Looking at this as an adult it is really more surprising that she always spoke well of him and did not criticise him because he really must have been a disaster of a husband She was better at maintaining correspondence with members of my family than I am .
