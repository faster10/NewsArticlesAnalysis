Surprisingly , however , when one talks to Israeli officials they don t spend as much time as one might expect worrying about an internal threat from those Muslims living within her borders . Israel s 10 million inhabitants include something like 1 . 8 million Muslims , most but not all of whom are Israeli citizens . They mostly live in their own neighborhoods and face conflicting pressures from their neighbors , co religionists and the Jewish state in which they live and work . It can t be easy , but in most ways they know they are better off in Israel than if they were under the control of the Palestinian Authority .
