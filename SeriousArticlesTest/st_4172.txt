You knew it had to be bad for Watt not to be able to return to Saturday ' s AFC wild card playoff game after leaving in the third quarter . He played through a deep thigh bruise in 2014 that never even led to a missed practice . On Saturday he seemed to be lobbying the team ' s medical staff and stood close to the sideline after that conversation finished , but they never allowed him back into the game . The Texans trailed 13 0 when Watt left the game and ultimately lost 30 0 to the Kansas City Chiefs .
