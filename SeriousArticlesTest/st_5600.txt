Santa Barbara , California I first heard of Dream Foundation in 1997 when the charity requested a visit to Graceland for a dream recipient . After the visit , I received a thank you note and photo of the dreamer in front of the Graceland gates . I was moved by her experience and decided I wanted to get more involved , so I picked up the phone to find out more about the foundation . I was absolutely mesmerized and instantly attached to their unique mission of granting wishes to adults with terminal illnesses .
