The occupiers have formed working groups to take on myriad social and economic issues , and their many occupation sites serve to test the approaches they come up with . One group is developing a complementary currency for use , initially , within the network of Occupy communities .

Another working group is pushing to have people withdraw their money from large corporate banks on November 5 and move it instead to local banks or cooperatively owned credit unions .
