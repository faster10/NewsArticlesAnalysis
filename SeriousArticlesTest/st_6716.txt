Brits have realised that Trump has now made the leap from ridiculous to dangerous one can only hope that this realisation occurs among potential Trump voters in America , and fast . In the wake of the Paris attacks , the San Bernardino shootings and other Isis inspired terrorist attacks around the globe , the last thing we need is the language of Donald Trump getting anywhere near the White House . Thankfully , for the 200 , 000 who signed the petition against his visit to the UK today , it s clear that many of us still believe Love Trumps Hate . ?
