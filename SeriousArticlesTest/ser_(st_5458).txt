Of course this all leads to a bigger picture talk about Lynch and his future . Lynch is slated to make 9 million in base salary next season , and his numbers are down and he is missing games for the first time in his Seahawks career . He ll be 30 years old next year . Rawls is slated to make 525 , 000 in 2016 . It will be hard for the Seahawks to let Lynch go , if they decide on that route . Seeing Rawls play like he has will make it a little easier .
