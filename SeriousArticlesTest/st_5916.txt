You ll have read by now that Rampling , 69 , in response to the bubbling unrest over AllWhiteOscars , touchily suggested to French radio that the dissent over the Academy s non diverse acting nominations is racist to whites . Beyond the fact that reverse racism is an absurd , fanciful concoction , any broader context ? such as the fact that she is one of this year s 20 white acting nominees ? did not appear to factor into her thinking . To rub salt into the wound , she said : Why classify people ? These days everyone is more or less accepted . It s an admirable sentiment ( bearing echoes of Blue Mink s novelty 1970 hit Melting Pot ) , but sadly untethered to the real world . Try telling it to the scores of black , brown and Asian creatives routinely shut out of opportunities at levels of the film industry far less glitzy than those celebrated at the Oscars .
