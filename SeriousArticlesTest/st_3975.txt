There are those who would tell us that purchases like this " unnecessary ! " " juvenile ! " etc . are signs of character weakness , that we are routinely " conned " into buying useless things by manipulative Mad Men , but I think it ' s more complicated . Because if there ' s one thing I learned after three years of watching folks shop and buy in good times , then bad it isn ' t that we buy that ' s been our problem , it ' s how we bought that was the issue : recklessly , and with little more than a piece of plastic or phantom home equity .
