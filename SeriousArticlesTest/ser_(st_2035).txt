Abdel Majad Abdel Bary followed a similar path . A DJ and rapper in London , Abdel Bary had lyrics that suggested redemption from drug use through religion . " It ' s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah , " he wrote . Abdel Bary claimed he was also seared by the memory of his father ' s arrest on terrorism charges . " I swear the day they came and took my dad , I could have killed a cop or two , " he rapped . Like Baryalei , he also joined ISIS , even tweeting a photograph of himself holding the severed head of one of the slain Western hostages .
