Green : Typically , by definition , nerds are interested in things that are not mainstream and may be subculture but subculture with usually a mythical bend or mathematic bend or scientific bend . So nerds are typically interested in subculture things that have to do with science or wizards or superpowers . Whereas geeks , I guess , usually tend to be the extreme version of that , where they ' re less able to relate to actual , other human beings that aren ' t interested in the same thing . Like geeks tend to be so focused and consumed with their subculture interests that they are incapable of communicating or interacting with other people i . e . , leaving the house or making dates or having social engagements .
