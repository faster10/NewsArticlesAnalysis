This is last year , but I ' m really stuck on Lana Del Rey . I ' ve been listening to that one a lot more and kind of stuck on the sound of that record . I really love " Raising Sand " as well Alison Krauss and Robert Plant . So that goes to show you how lost I am as far as production direction , because I ' m listening to such a broad spectrum . Both of those productions really appeal to me , and the direction that they took just trying to get ideas for myself .
