About the Panthers : Scared the living daylights out of their fans by holding on for a 31 24 win last week against Seattle after leading , 31 0 , at the half . It was the fourth time the Panthers have turned a rout into an adventure . They escaped with wins each time . . . Carolina is 9 0 at home , with four wins over playoff teams ( Houston , Green Bay , Washington and Seattle ) . . . When these teams met in the playoffs last year , Carolina got in with a 7 8 1 record and the Cardinals were down to their third quarterback after injuries to Carson Palmer and Drew Stanton . . . Defensive end Jared Allen has a broken foot and is doubtful . His loss is negligible , however . The five time Pro Bowler is in his 12th season and had two sacks in 12 games for the Panthers . . . Linebackers Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis are among 10 Pro Bowlers , most of any team . . . Cam Newton ran for 636 yards and 10 touchdowns in the regular season . He had only 3 yards last week a season low . Tackling the 260 pound Newton is one of the least appealing propositions for a defense . . . There were plenty of complaints about the slippery turf last week at Bank of America Stadium .
