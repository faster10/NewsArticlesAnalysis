Against a man who has dominated the tour and beaten all and sundry for the best part of two years , it almost goes without saying that starting slowly is likely to be a recipe for disaster . Of their three most recent grand slam meetings , Djokovic has won the first set in each , although two of them were in tie breaks . If Murray is going to win , the chances are he is going to need to get inside Djokovic s head and winning the first set may be one way he can do it . He managed it at the US Open in 2012 and at Wimbledon in 2013 and we all know what happened then . If he has recovered well enough from having 24 hours less than Djokovic to prepare , and he is ready from the first ball , anything is possible .
