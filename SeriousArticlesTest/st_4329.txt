If the purpose of the Security Council sanctions has been to compel North Korea to " abandon all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs in a complete , verifiable and irreversible manner , " they clearly haven ' t worked . The Security Council has passed a total of 11 resolutions on North Korea ' s ballistic missile and nuclear program since 2006 , with penalties as wide ranging as a full embargo on the export and import of weapons to North Korea and the inspection of flag vessels on the high seas that are suspected of carrying illicit cargo to and from the North . Is there any action that the Security Council can take that would substantially enhance the punitive impact on North Korea , persuading its leadership to change its behavior and return to the Six Party Talks format that has been dormant for years ? Bruce Klingner of the Heritage Foundation recommends a Chapter 7 resolution , which would allow the international community to enforce the sanctions on North Korea through military force if need be . Whether China or Russia would go that route , however , is a big " if . "
