Maybe it s just that they re confusing disrespect with dislike ? because there certainly is some of that directed at the Panthers . They are a selfie taking , drum beating , bat swinging , sideline dancing group of overly enthusiastic showoffs , and there s no doubt that has rubbed a lot of people the wrong way ? especially considering how much they ve had to celebrate this season . And yes , a lot of that has been directed at Newton for his post touchdown dabbing and his Superman celebrations that date back to his rookie year .
