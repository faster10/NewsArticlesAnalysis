The Task Force , an independent board of experts in interpretation of medical evidence , convened by the U . S . Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , sanctioned true screening experts to review and assess every published scientific study concerning prostate cancer screening . This recently published review is very reasonable . It recognizes that the few studies that suggest that prostate screening saves lives are undermined by biases and inconsistencies . Of course , the studies that did not show a benefit to screening also have flaws . However , all studies consistently show that significant harms are associated with screening and the sometimes unnecessary treatment .
