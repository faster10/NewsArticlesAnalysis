Recently I tweeted : " Judging from recent events , China has not met the requirements that constitute a country . There is no consensus on recognized elders , no clear set of values , no independent state military , no full citizenship , no international respect , no transparency for leaders ' whereabouts , no clear borders , no equal access to defense attorneys , no proper administration of justice , no taxpayer rights . . . As a country , China is missing all the qualities it needs to call itself a country . China is merely a faulty conjecture . "
