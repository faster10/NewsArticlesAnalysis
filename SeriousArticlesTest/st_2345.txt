12 . Daughter of Darkness respectfully declined Last year , Kelly Osbourne received an offer from " Playboy , " but turned them down , saying , " It was the second time they have asked and respectfully I declined , as I don ' t feel it ' s the right thing for me . I know if I ever decided to do something like that I ' d want it to be tasteful and done very beautifully . But still I turned it down I wouldn ' t want my father or brother Jack to open up a magazine and see me naked ! " I ' m sure Ozzy and her bro are both grateful for such restraint .
