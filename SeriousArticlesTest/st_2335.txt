( The Frisky ) Jenni " J Woww " Farley of MTV " Jersey Shore " fame might wear bedazzled boy shorts as if they were long pants , but she isn ' t going to take them off for " Playboy . " She has turned down a request to pose for the mag , even though the offer was reportedly for 400 , 000 . " I am not going to do Playboy in the near future , " she told Ryan Seacrest on his KIIS FM radio show recently . " There is a better opportunity out there , which everybody will probably see soon . " Most think this " better opportunity " is a possible " Jersey Shore " spin off show with her bestie , Snooki . Which has us craving pickles now .
