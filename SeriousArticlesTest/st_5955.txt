It seems to me that nowadays some stars confuse being stylish with dressing really slutty . What ' s your take ? I ' ve always been on the conservative side when it comes to showing skin . I ' m from that school where you show one part of your body , not all of it . So compared to the girls you ' re talking about , I ' m quite prim . . . But sometimes you just make mistakes . I once wore a see through dress to an event , but I had absolutely no idea . . . You didn ' t do the lighting test ! And I have never not done the lighting test after that . At the end of the day , you have to dress in what you ' re comfortable in . If you ' re at ease in a bikini top and a miniskirt though I certainly wouldn ' t be go for it .
