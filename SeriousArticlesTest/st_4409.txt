Zika is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito , which is well adapted to humans , thrives in people ' s homes and can breed in even a bottle cap ' s worth of stagnant water . While anyone can be bitten by Aedes , public health experts agree that the poor are more vulnerable because they often lack amenities that help diminish the risk , such as air conditioning and window screens .
