" Coach Pinkel brought people together , " said T . J . Moe , a former All Big 12 receiver at Missouri . " He created an environment of trust and hired the right assistants that could connect with players and understood that if you were going to have a good football team , you had to be a family . That ' s what we were at Missouri and why you ' re seeing the outpouring of love for Coach Pinkel from so many of his players . "
