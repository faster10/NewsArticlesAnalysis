Cosmo : As you get helped into the leggings and the big leather chest piece and then the cloak , you can feel the sort of gravitas of the character coming . Even the way you walk is informed by these things that drag along behind you you ' re almost pulling your cloak behind you . Costuming is a hugely important part of building the character and I wouldn ' t have it any other way . It does help , although at times it can be a bit annoying and cumbersome . It must have been about 50 60 pounds when it was on . As you see , I ' m a lightweight kind of guy ( his agency says he is 6 foot 1 and weighs about 240 pounds ) . But I know when I was wearing all the costume and I was about to get on my horse , he looked really , really unhappy .
