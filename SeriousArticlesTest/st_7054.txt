Banks are increasingly asking for collateral for education loans . If the loan is of more than Rs 4 lakh , they have the right to ask for collateral . But it is an issue . Flexible loans should be created by using unique identification number or Aadhaar information . For example , if you go under a period of unemployment , you get an automatic moratorium .

If you get a low paying job or you go to public sector and work in public sector , maybe you pay a little less , he added .
