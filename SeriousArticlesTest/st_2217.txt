Van Dyke was cleared just days before the city agreed to pay his family 5 million . When asked by Levine about the report clearing Van Dyke , Escalante responded , Without trying to pass the buck , I understand your question . There actually was never anything for me to sign off on but we re changing that so that there will be as we move forward .

There was no attempt to try to get his statements to match the evidence . Quite the contrary . http : cbsloc . al 1lpjmOv
