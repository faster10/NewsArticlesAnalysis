I think of Dom and Brian and I start to think of Paul . They said to make this short and sweet , so I will try to make this short and sweet . It was a labour of love . My only message to you is you d be amazed what you can do with love . You d be amazed at how powerful a force that is . When we didn t want to come back to filming when the tragedy was too heavy , it was the love of everyone combined that saw us through to the end .
