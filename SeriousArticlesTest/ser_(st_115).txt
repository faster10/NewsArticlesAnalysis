Zakaria : New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has suggested that everyone who gets a science or math PhD in this country should be given a green card along with their degree . And I think that ' s a wonderful idea . We should frankly make it incredibly easy for these people to stay here . They are the people who overwhelmingly create jobs . . . . Within a year or two they begin to pay back into the system at multiples of what they might have ever cost . And yet because of the usual political paralysis and dysfunction , it is right now unthinkable that we would ever enact a program like that . On the contrary , we ' re trying to throw more people out .
