There are examples of such cases to be found across the country , but one of the most recent and high profile has been State v . Skinner in New Jersey . The case involves Vonte Skinner , a drug dealer and aspiring rapper who was charged with attempted murder for his alleged involvement in a 2005 shooting . During his 2008 trial , prosecutors introduced as evidence 13 pages of his violent rap lyrics even though they were all composed before the shooting ( some of them years before ) and none contained specific details about the victim or the crime . Despite the paucity of other evidence against Skinner , the jury found him guilty .
