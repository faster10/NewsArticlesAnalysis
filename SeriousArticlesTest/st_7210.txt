This is the new reality in Carolina : winning big , living big . I don t know if we ever expect Newton s big plays , but we ve gotten pretty used to it , tight end Greg Olsen said after the game . This is what he s been since he got here in 2011 . And on paper , at least , that s true . Only two of Newton s regular season statistics in 2015 marked career bests : his 35 touchdowns and 10 interceptions . In fact , as a rookie , he attempted more passes , completed more , had a greater completion percentage and threw for more yards than he did in this , year five ? yet in 2011 , Carolina went 6 ? 10 and missed the playoffs .
