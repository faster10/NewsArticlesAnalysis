Clinton isn ' t the first president to meddle in presidential politics after his own presidency ended . So great was his dislike of Dwight Eisenhower that Harry Truman couldn ' t stay out of the 1952 race and even campaigned against Ike that fall . Richard Nixon made life unpleasant for Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican primary ( and seemed determined to undercut George Bush in 1992 , to Clinton ' s benefit ) . But Clinton ' s grudge isn ' t personal it ' s about how best to mount and run a campaign .
