Unfortunately , what sounds simple and logical does not necessarily make good policy in a complex situation . Supporting Mr Assad and Hizbollah , and their Iranian allies , will only further alienate the majority Sunni population of Syria , fuelling recruitment for jihadi organisations . Russia s bombing of Sunni groups unaffiliated with Isis makes matters worse . This was well understood by the French government up to now . It remains to be seen whether France will be able to resist the siren call of all with Assad against Isis .
