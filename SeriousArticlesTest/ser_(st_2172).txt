Kansas City snapped an eight game postseason losing streak with its 30 0 victory over the Texans on Saturday . But advancing to the Chiefs first AFC Championship Game 1993 could be tough if Maclin , by far their top pass catcher , is unable to play Saturday in New England . The Chiefs initially feared Maclin had hurt his right ACL . But an MRI revealed the ligament intact , and that he sustained an ankle sprain . The severity of it was unknown . If Maclin is unable to go , rookie Chris Conley would take his place against the Patriots .
