Meet the retooled Jeb Bush , the awkward scion of a political dynasty who thus far has had little use for making voters feel loved . He thinks his path to the election now runs through showing and selling his authentic nerdy self .

It is an all in bet on the idea that he really is someone the Republican Party will elect with all his experience , caution , wonkiness , and introversion .
