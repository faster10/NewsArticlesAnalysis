My first piece of advice is that you must stay strong . Don ' t feel discouraged to go out even though last weekend the white guy who lost his wallet at that party yelled that someone " n ggered " it . Don ' t feel discouraged because at that same party someone had the audacity to ask if you were the weed man . Most importantly , please do not lose it when your communications professor asks you to explain what " chitterlings " are and then moments later asks if he had permission to write the word " aint " on the white board .
