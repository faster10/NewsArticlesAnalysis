" I haven ' t got to this point by cheating the game , " James said . " If I ' m capable of practicing , I will practice , and if I ' m capable of playing , I ' ll play . When I ' m not , I ' ll quit . The game has gave too much to me for me to ever cheat the game . That ' s not how I was born . That ' s not how I was taught . "
