" The movie has this pretty long section where you hear them write that song and it ' s goose bumps , " Guggenheim told Rolling Stone in Toronto . " The writing of that song really saved the band . They had come out of the height of Joshua Tree as the biggest band in the world . ' Rattle and Hum ' was a disaster from their point of view , a lot of bad reviews they weren ' t happy with what they had become . They take that bridge section out of ' Mysterious Ways ' and they go back into the room at Hansa . They write a song on the fly in a matter of minutes . ' One ' is written and the band is saved and we have all that on tape . "
