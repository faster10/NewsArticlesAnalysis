The Broncos may be playing on their home turf , Sports Authority Field at Mile High , but it s the Patriots who are the defending Super Bowl champions . To play against those Peyton Manning led teams , you know you ve got to play 60 minutes , and you re going to be in for a tough game . The total has gone UNDER in the Patriots last five AFC title games , but has gone OVER in five of the last six Brady Manning games and in 11 of their 16 career matchups .
