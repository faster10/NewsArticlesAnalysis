DeBarge : I would say that I understand it , but if you ' re a vocalist it ' s good to sing . . . . I love to perform . I also like to sing . When I performed on " So You Think You Can Dance " I sang and I was dancing , so a lot of people were like " Is she lip syncing ? " But I was really just singing as well . It ' s really hard to do . People think it ' s a lot easier than it is .
