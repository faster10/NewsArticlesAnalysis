We find them among us , although we usually don ' t know it when we see it . On Coronado , on Orange Avenue , there was a bar called McP ' s , owned by an ex SEAL named Greg McPartlin . Whenever I would stop in there , groups of guys from the naval base would be having a cheeseburger , maybe listening to a local acoustic band play a guitars only version of The Beatles ' " We Can Work It Out . " You ' d sit among them , and it was easy to forget what brought them to this strip of sand . It wasn ' t for vacation , or relaxation . Where do we find such men ? Sometimes at the next table over , listening to the music .
