One would be mistaken to think of the presidency , under Turkey ' s existing parliamentary system , as a ceremonial post that would deprive its occupant of the executive powers of a prime minister . Turkey has had ambitious presidents , such as Turgut Ozal ( 1989 1993 ) and Ahmet Necdet Sezer ( 2000 2007 ) , whose influence was checked by hostile lawmakers or meddlesome generals . A President Erdogan wouldn ' t face these obstacles : his party controls the parliament and the military has been tamed through EU backed reforms and two highly politicized court cases .
