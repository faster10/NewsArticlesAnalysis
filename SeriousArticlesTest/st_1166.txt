RS : I think men and women find her compelling for different reasons . Men seem drawn to her because she s strong and beautiful , without seeming needy . At first I thought it was some dominatrix fantasy , but the more I talked to men in the fight game , the more I realized this went far beyond sexual attraction . There was a genuine respect there . Women seem drawn to her because she says things women all think about saying but rarely do . She s taken all the things that have been weaknesses ? crying , impulsiveness , vulnerability , sensitivity , sentimentality , neediness ? and turned them into strengths . I can ' t tell you how many women from all walks of life , all ages and all places , were interested in her . The most fascinating thing became how all those things people liked about her , got flipped after she lost . It was amazing to me how quickly people wanted to shame her back into behaving after she lost .
