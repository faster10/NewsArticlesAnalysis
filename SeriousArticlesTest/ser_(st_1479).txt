With " 1989 " still being high in the charts , Swift will probably end the year with the second top selling album unless Rihanna ' s long awaited eight studio album " Anti " is released . The rest of the Top 10 spots will belong to albums such as Sam Smith ' s " In the Lonely Hour " , Ed Sheeran ' s " X " , and the November 13th released albums by pop heavyweights One Direction " Made in the A . M . " and Justin Bieber " Purpose . "
