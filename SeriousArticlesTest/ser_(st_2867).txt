In 1993 at the Vienna Human Rights Conference , many of us human right people lobbied for the change to make human rights a higher priority by reforming the Human Rights Council in the United Nations in Geneva to make it more effective . Today , as Saudi Arabia destroys another neighbor , a Saudi official sits on the Human Rights Council . The joke is on the people of the world , to say nothing of the people supporting their high flying war machines with no accountability to anyone . ISIS is the beneficiary of this disaster because the Saudi leave them in place and do not attack them .
