In a season in which both No . 6 seeds ( the Seahawks and Steelers ) have realistic chances of reaching the Super Bowl , I ' m sticking with two of the favorites . The best thing to happen to the Panthers was losing to the Atlanta Falcons . A wake up call before the playoffs at once alleviates pressure and renews a sense of urgency . A 15 1 record is a 15 1 record , even though their schedule wasn ' t exactly the toughest in history . The questionable group of wide receivers doesn ' t have to be sensational , it just needs to haul in the catchable passes from Newton . The combination of Newton and a healthy Jonathan Stewart gives Carolina a formidable rushing attack . They stop the run . The linebacking duo of Thomas Davis and Luke Kuechly is arguably the game ' s best . And cornerback Josh Norman needs to play with the edge he did not exhibit against the Falcons . They Panthers will likely need to hurdle the Seahawks to get to the Super Bowl . Tough challenge , but the Panthers have already done it in Seattle . Newton will cap his MVP season by winning the Super Bowl .
