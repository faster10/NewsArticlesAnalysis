" But every now and then , she ' ll whisper in my ear and say : ' Daddy , I wish for you that you ' d get a new job and I ' m proud of you . ' She actually used those words , ' I ' m proud of you . ' So I ' m stuck driving a cab right now . I never thought it would happen . But I still believe it ' s all gonna work out things do get better . "
