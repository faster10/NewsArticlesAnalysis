Texas food banks distributed nearly 43 million pounds of food in the second quarter of 2010 , 14 percent more than in the same period last year . Nearly 11 percent more Texans lived in poverty last year than the year before , including more than one of every four under age 18 . " If these numbers don ' t convey a sense of urgency , I don ' t know what will , " said J . C . Dwyer , state policy director of the Texas Food Bank Network .
