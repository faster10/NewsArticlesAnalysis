A : Yes . The two governments ? India and Japan ? need to be involved , they need to agree , because without that the priest of the temple will not agree to hand over the material . There are bones but if the bones are charred very badly you cannot extract the DNA . Some specialists in the field have looked at the pictures of the bones and they say it s quite conceivable that one could ( extract DNA ) because there are larger parts of the jaw and so on and that the DNA could be extracted from the centre of the bones . I think one should try . Originally , I was a bit hesitant because I felt the Japanese would feel very insulted but this whole rather undignified discussion which has been going on over decades can possibly be , well not put to rest , because there will be some people who will not take DNA proof as proof either . But I think rational people would at least accept the outcome of that , whichever way it were to go . The danger is that maybe the Japanese government feels that , well , what if they are not his remains then they will sort of feel embarrassed . That is an issue where they may dilly dally around it .
