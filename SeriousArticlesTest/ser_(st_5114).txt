It may have been Guzman who engineered the meeting with Penn , who has himself played real life gangsters such as the L . A . mob boss Mickey Cohen in the 2013 film Gangster Squad . The drug lord was allegedly working on a new movie production of his own life , and his meeting with the Oscar winning actor was brokered by Mexican actress Kate del Castillo , who played La Reina del Sur in a TV version of the novel , and has been reportedly coordinating with Guzman on the new film . After her drug trafficking role , she controversially wrote sympathetic messages about Guzman . I believe more in El Chapo Guzman than in the governments that hide the truth from me , she tweeted in Spanish in 2012 . In response , Guzman sent her flowers , according to Penn s piece , leading to a friendship between drug lord and soap star .
