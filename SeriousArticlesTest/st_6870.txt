We arrived in Liberia with a small crew of three and quickly rendezvoused with a local journalist who would be our fixer and guide . Our first shooting location was the West Point slum , home to 80 , 000 people living in conditions that redefine squalor . Miles of rotting garbage surround the slum , which has no sewage system . Pretty much everyone even the local government officials defecates and urinates in the open . Drugs , prostitution and armed robbery are the main industries . We got to know some of the residents of West Point , who told us their stories as they smoked heroin and cocaine and begged us for money .
