The only other instance in this playoff run that a team sent blitzers after Brady less than 10 percent of the time ? That was a game the Broncos would like to relive this weekend , the 2013 AFC Championship Game . Denver won 26 16 that day , and , although Brady played well , the Broncos did an excellent job of collapsing the interior of his line , especially with nose tackle Terrance Knighton against the aforementioned Mankins , who was playing his last game as a member of the Patriots .
