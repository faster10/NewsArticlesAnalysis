I ' ll come into a city , and I ' ll meet absolute strangers . And within days , they ' re kind of like friends and family . And it ' s hard when you look into their faces and you see the sadness and the loss , the shock and confusion . And all I can hope is that what we did makes a difference in their lives . . . and hopefully others will also rise to the occasion , see the needs and do something about it .
