Paramount and MGM spent 50 million to produce " Hansel and Gretel , " which was shot in 2011 and originally scheduled to be released in March 2012 . Distributor Paramount moved the film ' s release to this month to capitalize on star Jeremy Renner , whom the studio hoped would blossom into a true box office draw following " The Avengers " and " The Bourne Legacy . " ( It also seems likely that " Hansel and Gretel " got placed in January due to its poor quality January tends to be a dumping ground for studios ' stinkers . ) Whether or not Renner had anything to do with it , the date change proved at least somewhat effective " Hansel and Gretel " outgrossed the last supernatural fantasy with Hunter in the title , " Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter , " which staked a weak 16 . 3 million in its debut frame .
