" You know , as I was coming up here , I always do this . I say ? I m not going to get emotional about , ? you know , winning these awards , and I was cool when I was sitting in my seat , and then they handed me two awards . One for favorite action movie and one for favorite film . You all thought that this was your favorite film . I think of Dom and Brian and I start to think of Paul . They said to make this short and sweet , so I will try to make this short and sweet . It ? was a labor of love . My only message to you is you d be amazed what you can do with love . You d be amazed at how powerful a force that is . When we didn t want to come back to filming when the tragedy was too heavy , it was the love of everyone combined that saw us through to the end .
