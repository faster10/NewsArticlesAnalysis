Joire especially likes this phone ' s voice prompting feature : " When you plug in a SIM card , it tells you to pick from three languages . When you pick a language , it asks you whether you ' d like voice prompting . You should say yes , because then , for pretty much everything you do , you ' ll get walked through by voice . That ' s helpful because this visual interface is very minimal . The segmented OLED display is mainly just icons baked into the e ink , hard to interpret . "
