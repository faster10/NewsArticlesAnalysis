The disappointment was tempered somewhat by the men ' s gymnastics team , which took bronze , its first medal in the sport in 100 years . When the results were first announced Great Britain was to get silver , but the fourth place Japanese team protested a score for one of its gymnasts . The judges upped Kohei Uchimura ' s mark on the pommel horse , giving Japan 271 . 952 to Great Britain ' s 271 . 711 and Ukraine ' s 271 . 526 . As many expected , China won the team title , as it did in two of the past three Olympics .
