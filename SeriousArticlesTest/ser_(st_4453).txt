Pakistan has a 20 percent Shia population and some 500 Shias have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight against IS . A recent car bombing in the Shia majority Parachinar city of the tribal region of Kurram killed 25 and injured dozens . Those who have recently joined the fight in Syria are now actively using social media to lure others in to joining IS . The Pakistani terror group Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat ( ASWJ ) accepted responsibility and put the blame on Shias travelling to Syria and Iraq . The ASWJ purportedly had an electoral alliance in Punjab with the ruling Muslim League of Chief Minister ( CM ) Shahbaz Sharif , the brother of PM Nawaz Sharif .
