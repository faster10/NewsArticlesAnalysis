Chetry : You know , there is some unprecedented government intervention going on right now in the U . S . auto industry at your competitors . They ' re getting billions of dollars in taxpayer money . They ' re being forced to restructure , as we talked about . They actually were forced to fire their CEO . And right now , it seems that , you know , they ' re on a different level than you guys are . Is there some sense that perhaps there ' s an unfair advantage , that they ' re getting a lot of government help , whereas you guys are sort of on your own . Does that concern you ?
