Let me ask you a question . If on 9 11 , 13 of the 16 hijackers were Iranian , what would have happened ? My guess is that a bombing campaign would have been initiated by at least two nations , the U . S . A . and Israel . But since the 13 of 16 hijackers were Saudis , there was no reaction to where the terrorists came from . In fact , President Bush ensured that the Saudis living and studying in our country got home safely and immediately . My question is this , why did the U . S . government not send a squad of FBI agents and accountants to Saudi Arabia to see who in that society paid for that attack ?
