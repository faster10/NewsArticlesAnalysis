However , despite " Beast ' s " commendable performance , it ' s worth pointing out that it fell short of last September ' s " The Lion King 3D , " which debuted to 30 . 2 million . That could be the result of several factors . For one , " King " was a much bigger hit in its original release , earning 312 . 9 million versus " Beast ' s " 145 . 9 million .

And " Beast " had a harder time attracting the interest of boys . According to Disney , just 31 percent of " Beast 3D ' s " audience was male compared to 44 percent for " Lion King 3D . "
