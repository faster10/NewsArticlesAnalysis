This has been billed as a series between young , athletic , exciting teams , and for the majority of what turned out to be a five hour and nine minute game , the clubs younger players were the difference makers , usually in unexpected ways . The Mets hadn t trailed in a game for 41 straight innings , since early in Game 5 of the NLDS , but it took them just one pitch to fall behind in their first World Series in 15 years . The 28 year old Royals leadoff hitter Alcides Escobar swung at the 26 year old Harvey s 95 mph fastball and drove it to left center , where it glanced off Yoenis Cespedes and rolled to the warning track . Escobar circled the bases for an inside the park home run , the first in a World Series game since Mule Haas s in 1929 .
