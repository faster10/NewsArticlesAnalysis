The third division should be the undercard debate . Fiorina , Paul , Kasich , Huckabee , and Christie are all roughly in the same position below four percent and have roughly the same chances of breaking out and having an actual chance of winning . And , finally , the has been division ( who struggle to even reach a single percent in the polls ) should be shoved off television entirely on debate nights . Santorum and Jindal have precisely the same chance ( zero ) of winning the nomination next year as Pataki , Graham , and Gilmore . They ' ve had their shot , now it ' s time to show them the door .
