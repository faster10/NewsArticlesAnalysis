joshM " While serving in Iraq with the United States Marines , I met my wife . She is in the United States Army . We met while on R R in Qatar . We did long distance for the remaining time that we had left of our deployment and then another year while I was still stationed in Cherry Point , North Carolina . She is still stationed at Fort Campbell , Kentucky . After I separated from the Marines as a corporal , I moved to Kentucky to be with her . We are now happily married , and she is on her third tour to Iraq . So even though the news shows all the bad things of war , some good really does come from it . "
