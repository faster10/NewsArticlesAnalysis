It ' s definitely a kick in the rear end for our team for sure , knowing all the work we put into it , and knowing the two other guys . You know , Kyrie ' s games being limited like that I figured the coaches wouldn ' t give him the nod , but you know he ' s an All Star . And then with Kev , I think Kev has played great basketball for the first half of the season . He could ' ve been awarded , but hopefully those guys use it as motivation for the rest of the season and the team will as well .
