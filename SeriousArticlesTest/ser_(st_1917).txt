Another possible reason for her silence is to play kingmaker and get something in return for the endorsement . Warren s support will have substantial weight in the Democratic primary so she is probably expecting an offer such as a Cabinet post or even the veep spot on the ticket . With so much turmoil in the primary and only a week to go until Iowa , she can demand it . Don t you think that Hillary would sell her soul for this endorsement to change the narrative of the campaign ?
