There ' s a lot of choice . It ' s overwhelming , and it ' s overwhelming trying to pinpoint who to go with on this project , because it will determine a lot of the direction , and I ' m committing myself . It ' s that fear of committing myself once and for all and locking myself in . That ' s what scares me the most , really . And I ' ve had a lot of fun just being creative with it and just floating around , changing my mind . And that ' s part of the whole thing of being creative until you commit , you can change your mind and rewrite it and create a new melody and change the story . And at some point that ' s got to end . And that is the point when you actually make the records . So letting go of that phase of it is probably my biggest hesitation .
