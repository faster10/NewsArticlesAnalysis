" You just got to move on , " Beckham said Thursday after practice . " We still play the Jets . Last time I was concerned , it wasn ' t me versus Revis . It would have been fun to be able to go against a guy like that . Obviously , you know I have high praise for him . Unfortunate that he ' s not playing , but down the road , you never know , there may be a matchup there . But right now we ' re focused on beating the Jets . "
