Lucknow : Among the first set of Netaji files , which have been declassified by the Centre on the 120th birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose , there is a letter ( dated September 1 , 1979 ) written by the then Governor of West Bengal and former chief minister of UP Tribhuvan Narain Singh , in which Singh says that he believes that Sardar Vallabhbahi Patel knew for long that Netaji had married a foreign girl . Following objections being raised on this , Governor Singh asked the MHA to ascertain the truth .
