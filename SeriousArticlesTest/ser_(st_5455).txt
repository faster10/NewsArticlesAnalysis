Debi Mazar : I grew up on food stamps . I come from a very humble background . And I ' ve had many friends that have been destitute you know , running into trouble and places like The Midnight Mission have given them hope and have fed them and gotten them back on the right path . It can happen to anybody , and with the economy crashing and what ' s going on in the world today , I just thought it was time to try to find a place to go to help people .
