Writer director Tommy Wirkola , whose first film was the cult Nazi zombie pic " Dead Snow , " hasn ' t concocted more than a slender thread of a narrative . A witch is snatching so many children that the town mayor brings in the sibling celebrity bounty hunters ( wait a minute , didn ' t Terry Gilliam all ready make this movie as " The Brothers Grimm " ? ) . Rather than construct any scares , suspense or surprise , the movie attempts to stave off boredom with a dose of kung fu fighting every five minutes .
