That ' s one tough kite to fly , but the Schulz descendants who oversaw this new Peanuts avoid the obvious traps to ensure a charming , harmless trip down memory lane . Schulz ' s son Craig produced the project , co writing the script with his son Bryan and Cornelius Uliano , and they have taken the necessary steps to please the Great Pumpkin faithful . Director Steve Martino ( Horton Hears A Who ! ) and the team at Fox ' s Blue Sky Animation Studios lifted much of the dialogue and character poses verbatim from the strip . ( The image of Charlie Brown on his pitcher ' s mound getting the wind knocked out of him by a fastball will always endear . ) Trombone Shorty ' s got the wah wah of the adults covered , and Pig Pen still gets to glide on a cloud of dust . The peppy score from Christophe Beck tips its hat to the iconic Vince Guaraldi tunes of yesteryear . The movie even goes one step further and resurrects Bill Melendez , director and producer of pretty much every previous animated Peanuts escapade , by repurposing archival audio of his comforting Snoopy and Woodstock noises .
