I believe China is currently in the range of 3 to 5 percent growth , and headed rapidly to zero . Some people take this to be a radical position , but is it ? Is it so uncommon for countries to have recessions every now and then ? It s now China s turn , due to debt buildup , excess capacity and problems in reforming their state owned enterprises . Longer run , I think they can expect growth at 4 percent . At most . The big losers here are Brazil , Peru , Singapore and other parts of Asia , as well as Africa . The United States will chug along at 2 percent growth , and mostly ignore what could be the beginnings of a major global recession . We are about the most insulated from this of just about anybody .
