One thing that has always been important for me , and it may seem very self absorbed or whatever , is first of all your presentation of who you are . I think it s much easier for a trans woman or a trans man who authentically kind of looks and plays the role . So what I call my presentation . I try to take that seriously . I think it puts people at ease . If you re out there and , to be honest with you , if you look like a man in a dress , it makes people uncomfortable . So the first thing I can do is try to present myself well . I want to dress well . I want to look good . When I go out , as Kim says , you ve got to rock it because the paparazzi will be there . The second thing I want to do in living my life authentically is be intelligent on the subject . Hopefully as time goes on I ll learn more and more and more and get better at that .
