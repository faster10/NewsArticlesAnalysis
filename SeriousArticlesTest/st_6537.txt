" This is a sad day ! Our family , Dottie and I would like to convey our deepest sympathy to Sue and her family . Nobody did more for the academic reputation of Penn State than Joe Paterno . He maintained a high standard in a very difficult profession . Joe preached toughness , hard work and clean competition . Most importantly , he had the courage to practice what he preached . Nobody will be able to take away the memories we all shared of a great man , his family , and all the wonderful people who were a part of his life . "
