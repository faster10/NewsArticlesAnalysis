The affinity of this family towards Netaji could be gauged from the fact that their drawing room boasts of a autographed photograph of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose dated March 4 , 1938 . Throwing light on Netaji ' s Lucknow visit , RK Roy said , " Netaji visited Lucknow twice . Once when he addressed the public during the freedom struggle from Jhandewalan Park , my father along with my grandfather had gone to hear him , and both were highly impressed . " He further stated that during one of his Lucknow visit , Netaji had stayed at the residence of Seth Kishori Lal Agarwal in Narhi , who presented him a sandalwood garland . " The same garland is still preserved and conserved at Netaji Museum in Kolkata , " added Roy .
