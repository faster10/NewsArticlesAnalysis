Jordan never had that sendoff tour . He tantalized us with moments of " what if " rather than " what used to be . " And that fire never went away , nor did his ability to engulf the competition with it . We ' re in the middle of a celebration of a Kobe send off now and for the next few months . It ' s something we failed to do with Michael during those Wizards years , and something we should be at least more respectful of now when we talk about Jordan ' s last hurrah .
