Zone batting is new for " The Show . " That ' s where the right stick controller determines your stride and swing while the left allows you to move your " sweet spot " to the area where you think the ball will cross the plate . " 2K12 " already uses a similar style to determine how hard you are swinging and where . The feature also will gives you hits about the pitch as the ball is heading for the plate , much as a skilled batter would be able to recognize a curveball from a slider . " The Show " also has a simple button swing mechanic if that is more your speed .
