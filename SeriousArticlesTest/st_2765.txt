Trump actually is leading a modern day " Know Nothing " movement . His anti immigrant and anti Muslim hatemongering is at least out of the 1850s if not the Middle Ages , and it has no place in today ' s Republican Party . His ideas are usually unconstitutional , un American or unconservative ? and very often an alarming hat trick of all three . Whatever group he claims to represent should have to embrace his dimwitted and divisive proposals without the imprimatur of the Republican Party or the conservative movement . And Republicans shouldn ' t have to defend religious tests , internment camps or President Dwight Eisenhower ' s " Operation Wetback " just because Trump and his goon surrogates do .
