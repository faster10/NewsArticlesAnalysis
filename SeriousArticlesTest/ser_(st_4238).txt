Leguizamo : Kamikaze cabs , buses , tourists , people from New Jersey . A Jersey plate will always try to cut you off for sure . And you know Miami and Connecticut plates are always going to go way slow , but that ' s not as dangerous . And then the crazy pedestrian that comes out between two big vans that block the view , that jump out . There ' s more danger for them than for you , but you don ' t want to hurt nobody , either .
