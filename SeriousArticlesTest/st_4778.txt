What makes this Panthers ' offense different from previous renditions is two things primarily . One , offensive coordinator Mike Shula is creative . It ' s pretty stunning how intricate his running game has become . It ' s not overly complex , per se , but the Panthers are using a strong ground game to set up misdirection and are being creative with how they deploy lineman . Two , their red zone attack is ridiculous . Look at Cam Newton ' s touchdown passes from Sunday five of them , traveling a total of 27 yards !
