" The bombs can land in fields , in homes , in villages , and of course it poses a risk to civilians , " said Klaus Ljoerring Pedersen , regional director of the Danish Demining Group , a humanitarian organization that helps solve problems related to leftover ordnance . " Civilians do not recognize what is a bomblet dangerous and highly explosive and what is a toy . So you see a lot of curious children after these raids go out and identify these new and exiting objects and blow their hands and heads off . "
