We didn ' t play well on defense . We didn ' t play well enough as a team . We didn ' t do much to get the spark going as a team . From a defensive standpoint , we didn ' t create turnovers and gave them a short field . Miller stated , We were just waiting around and waiting for someone to do something . As a defense , we went out there and got turnovers . We just didn ' t do that today . ?
