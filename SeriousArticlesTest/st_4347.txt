Gun shots ringing out at the Stade de France . Machine gunfire at a caf terrace . Shootings in a Cambodian restaurant . The tolls of the injured , dead and missing rising like the mercury in a thermometer . Seven attacks in total , with 129 dead . It ' s beyond the comprehension of anyone living in Paris .

It was a cafe theatre in the 19th century , then an Opera , then a cinema in the 1930s . It closed for many years and reopened in the 1980s , a venue for rock and pop and welcomed stars like Prince or the Velvet Underground .
