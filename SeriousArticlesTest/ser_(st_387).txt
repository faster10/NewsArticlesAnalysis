Today s Bluegrass State Showdown : We re essentially one year out before Election Day 2016 , and we have plenty of political stories and information to mark that milepost ( just see below ) . But today is also Election Day 2015 , and here is the marquee contest we re following : Kentucky s gubernatorial race between Democrat Jack Conway and Republican Matt Bevin . Back in the summer , we dubbed the race possibly the Last Obama War , because it largely hinges on this question : Whom do Kentucky voters dislike more ? President Obama or the tea party ? ( Of course , we could also see this same dynamic play out in the Louisiana gubernatorial race on Nov . 21 . ) The Conway Bevin race also has a lot at stake , too ? the future of the state s health care exchange ( Bevin says he will eliminate it ) , Rand Paul s Senate seat in 2016 ( if Democrats win , we bet you they ll be emboldened to find a challenger to Paul ) , and Kim Davis and religious also have been issues in this race . So who s going to win ? It s still very close , but put a thumb on the scale for Conway , The Cook Political Report s Jennifer Duffy told us . Final polling places in Kentucky close at 6 : 00 p . m . ET ( in the eastern part of the state ) and 7 : 00 p . m . ET ( in the central time zone ) .
