Think about the important and prominent players who either never suited up for the bowl games or left early : Shaq Lawson ( injured ) and Deon Cain ( suspended ) of Clemson Trevone Boykin ( suspended ) and Josh Doctson ( injured ) of TCU Vernon Adams ( injured ) of Oregon Joey Bosa ( ejected for targeting ) and Adolphus Washington ( suspended ) of Ohio State Jaylon Smith ( injured ) and Max Redfield ( suspended ) of Notre Dame Robert Nkemdiche ( suspended ) of Mississippi Everett Golson ( no show for personal reasons ) of Florida State James Burgess of Louisville ( ejected from his final college game for targeting on the first play of the Music City Bowl against Texas A M ) Kyle Allen and Kyler Murray ( transferring ) of Texas A M and so on . That is a long , star studded and yet very abridged list .
