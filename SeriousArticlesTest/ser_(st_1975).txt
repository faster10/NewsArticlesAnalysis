Meanwhile , NBC s Ali Vitali has the dispatch on the event where Trump DID show up . The buzz for Trump s counter debate programming was huge . The news out of the event , however , was less so . A packed auditorium of about 700 at Drake University listened to Trump speak ? but Trump spoke for less time than veterans and fellow politicians that joined him on stage . In fact , he wasn t the only 2016 Republican candidate to speak behind the Trump branded podium . Former Sen . Rick Santorum and former Gov . Mike Huckabee both joined Trump after appearing at the Fox undercard debate ? but it wasn t politics that brought them there , they said . Instead , it was to support the veterans . Still , it was a somewhat bizarre sight to see former Iowa caucus winners and current candidates alike speaking behind a podium emblazoned with the frontrunner s name on it . Santorum chose to counter that weirdness by standing off to the side of the podium , to avoid a bad shot . Huckabee on the other hand accepted it . I figure you re gonna get the photo anyway , I might as well just stand here and be done with it , he said with a laugh .
