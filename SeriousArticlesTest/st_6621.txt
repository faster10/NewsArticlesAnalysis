The Panthers have particularly worked on diversifying Ginn s route running this season . You look two years ago at what he did , Proehl said , and he went deep , and he ran a lot of comebacks . Now he s running over the middle . He s doing a lot of different things that keep defenses off balance . . . . And he s as good as there is running after a catch . That s when the punt returner in him comes out . It s just a matter of getting the ball in his hands .
