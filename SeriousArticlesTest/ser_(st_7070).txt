Maggie Serota , managing editor of the website Death and Taxes , is one of Strang s admirers . She admits that she didn t think Strang was a hunk at first , but grew more and more fond of him as the series went on . He s not a guy who turns your head when you re walking down the street , per se . But in the context of the documentary , he comes off like a real life Sandy Cohen , she says , in a reference to the father character ( also a soft hearted defense attorney ) played by Peter Gallagher on Fox s the OC .
