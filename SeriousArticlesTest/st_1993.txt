I saw her for the first time in the beginning . After I left , we ' d exchange e mails through a translator and Dr Patel would send photos during the course of the pregnancy . One of the most challenging things was the distance . When your surrogate ' s in the U . S . you ' re able to talk to her every day and you ' re free to be engaged in her life so I didn ' t have that option , which was really sad and unfortunate because I really wanted to feel connected to the pregnancy . I had been pregnant before , once until very far in , so it was hard for me . If I could do it all over again I would stay in India the whole time . I think it ' s such a big part of the process and that was definitely a huge challenge for me .
