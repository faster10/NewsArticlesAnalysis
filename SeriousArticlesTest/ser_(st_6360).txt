Mets : Promoted from setup man to closer in early April when Jenrry Mejia was handed the first of two long drug suspensions , Jeurys Familia has been invaluable in the ninth inning ? and sometimes earlier . He earned 43 saves this season , matching the franchise record , and finished with a 1 . 85 ERA in 76 appearances . Then he saved five games in eight scoreless outings during the NL playoffs , getting six outs to protect a one run lead in the deciding Game 5 of the Division Series at Dodger Stadium . The bridge to Familia was built with two summer trades . Seventh inning reliever Addison Reed has been lights out when entering with nobody on , but ineffective when inheriting runners . Experienced setup man Tyler Clippard is an accomplished All Star , but hasn ' t been at his best lately . Beyond that , the Mets have hard throwing rookie Hansel Robles and two starters in the bullpen : lefty Jonathon Niese and 42 year old Bartolo Colon . They ' ve been effective when called upon in October , but this isn ' t exactly the deepest bullpen ever seen in a World Series .
