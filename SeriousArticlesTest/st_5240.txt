He said : ' I want my kids to be polite and respectful , stand on their own two feet . In the future if they want to go and do charitable work , then I ' ll fund that charitable work . I ' ve said that rather than me buying them a house , I ' ll give them a contribution on top of what they deliver . So if they earn 20 , 000 a year , I ' ll give them a tiny contribution on top . If they decide not to work , they don ' t get anything . I want them to do it for themselves . '
