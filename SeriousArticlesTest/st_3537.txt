Just as compromise becomes more important in the actual business of politics , we have a voter base that , ever younger , increasingly rewards authenticity , as if they re picking a craft beer and not a candidate . Sanders leads Democrats from the millennial generation by a vast margin in the Republican race , Donald Trump does the same . There too , there s a search for genuineness at work . Trump is the very opposite of dignified and presidential ? but this is seen as a frank unwillingness to censor himself . This was exactly the case with Labour s Corbyn in Britain , too , where younger people , who largely came out in his support in the leadership election , saw him as the antithesis of the mealy mouthed , hypocritical Blairites .
