I find I can live with the discomfort of people who can ' t wrap their minds around the idea that the world does not revolve around them . They can always shower somewhere else if it bugs them that much . I ' ll be in there dropping the soap , perfectly secure in the knowledge that I have a wife who loves me , whom I love back , and that there is an HR department in my organization I can turn to if something inappropriate were to occur . In fact , I ' d probably be flattered if someone told me I looked good .
