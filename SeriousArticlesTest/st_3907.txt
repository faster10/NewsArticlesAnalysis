Quincy Jones : When I was a musical director we were working together on a film project . He asked me to help him find a producer for his first solo album . Watching him was incredible . He would learn everybody else ' s parts the dialogues , the songs , the dance steps and I saw something in him . I saw a part of him that had never been exposed before . We went all the way to Michael ' s soul at that time and it was am amazing experience .
