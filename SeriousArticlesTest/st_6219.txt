The sport of football wasn t designed for that , Foster said . Is it a gruesome game ? Is there a thin line between , you know , going over the top and playing the right way ? Yeah , it is , but you have to understand that you have to be smart enough to realize that you can t do those things on the football field , and especially in a prime time game like that , and against some guys you re going to see at least twice a year , anyway . We just play our ball , though . We have to be smarter than that .
