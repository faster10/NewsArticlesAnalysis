In a way , this all makes sense . The modern conservative movement , for instance , isn t actually about ideological support for small government , ? so much as it s about ? reserving government largess for white conservatives , while sticking the rest of us with the bill while we get nothing in return for it . It makes sense that the same kinds of people that want the government to give free land to rich ranchers while begrudging poor children food stamps might have a similar double standard when it comes to basic rights , like the right to free speech .
