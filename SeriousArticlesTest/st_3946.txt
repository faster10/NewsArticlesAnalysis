All Republicans have drifted in this direction of abandoning traditional speech making in favor of randomly tossing out right wing slogans , but Palin is the absolute master ? of the form . But ? her purpose here ? and the same can be said of Donald Trump ? is not to make logical or even comprehensible policy arguments . It s to stoke a sense of grievance in white people by pushing their buttons . Even trying to mimic the form of an argument based , content driven speech would undermine the larger mission . The idea here is to clear the head of all logic and rationality , and fill it with pure rage and entitlement . Ideally , you get conservative voters down to the level of toddlers shaking their rattles and screaming at the top of their lungs because Mommy won t give you all the candy right now .
