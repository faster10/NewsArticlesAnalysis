I remember asking Farooq Abdullah if they said they would dismiss him as bluntly as that and he replied , Yes , straight to my face and I said , wonderful , if the Government of India wants to sink India , then go ahead and give it to me in writing . I told my chief secretary to please take a note that such and such team has come , that they have the PM s and Cabinet s orders that the five militants have to be released at all costs . Whatever the cost to the country and therefore whatever the onus , whatever happens here , to the country will be because of the Government of India . Get them to sign this .
