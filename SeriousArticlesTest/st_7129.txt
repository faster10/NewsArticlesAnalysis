Which young defender is first in line for an extension ? The Patriots don t have any big ticket free agents , but some strategic planning must be done to account for the fact that four promising young defenders all have deals that expire after the 2016 season : linebackers Dont a Hightower and Jamie Collins , defensive end Chandler Jones and cornerback Malcolm Butler .

Butler would be a restricted free agent after next season , so the Patriots retain some leverage in his situation and that puts him in a different category than the others .
