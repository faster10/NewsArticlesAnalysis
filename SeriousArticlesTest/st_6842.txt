The 49ers gained just 189 total yards . While the injuries to the running backs can t be ignored , using injuries as an excuse is for bandwagon fans . They happen , and the S . F . organization hasn t spent its money wisely enough to have quality backups especially in a week where they just cut Jarryd Hayne . The 49ers had just 38 yards rushing , 28 of those yards came from Kaepernick . Reggie Bush was hurt ( again ) and the team was down to Mike Davis and Kendall Gaskins at the RB position .
