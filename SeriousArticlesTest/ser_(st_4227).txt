I love Paris for the million reasons that everybody loves the city . It ' s an incredibly romantic and beautiful place . I hate to say this , but things have changed in the last three or four years . Notre Dame is white now . They steam cleaned it . Instead of this medieval , sooty , dark , mysterious thing rising into the night sky , now it ' s kind of a nice limestone cathedral . They ' ve done a lot of stuff like that in Paris now . They don ' t let you smoke in the cafes anymore on and on and on . The Paris of that time period was an incredible place . It was the central city on earth of idealism , of romance , of dreams , of possibilities , of beauty in many ways , of great food , great wine , staying up all night what could be bad ?
