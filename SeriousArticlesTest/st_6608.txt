As Kennedy explained , removal of an unauthorized migrant is a civil matter where even if the person is out of status , federal officials have wide discretion to determine whether deportation makes sense . For example , if an unauthorized person is trying to support his family by working or has " children born in the United States , long ties to the community , or a record of distinguished military service , " officials may let him stay . Also , if individuals or their families might be politically persecuted or harmed upon return to their country of origin , they may also remain in the United States .
