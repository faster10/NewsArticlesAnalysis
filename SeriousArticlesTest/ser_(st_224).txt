Big Ten Championship : Michigan State vs . Iowa ( 3 . 5 ) : Michigan State ' s ability to grind out wins in tight games should favor the Spartans against an Iowa team that is more than willing to play that same kind of game , but is it possible the Mark Dantonio magic has run out ? Iowa ' s only 6 5 against the spread in lined games , but all five ATS losses have missed the number by a total of 9 . 5 points . Las Vegas has a pretty good read on the Hawkeyes , and if the oddsmakers think Iowa can hang within a field goal , I think this ground game can lead Kirk Ferentz to his first Big Ten title since 2004 . Pick : Hawkeyes 3 . 5 .
