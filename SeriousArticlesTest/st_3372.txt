Most people understand that the U . S . health care system is expensive , but few realize just how expensive . So here s one very simple way of looking at it : As a share of the economy , the U . S . spends at least 50 to 60 more on health care than other Western countries . For us , 16 . 4 of the economy goes to health spending . The next highest spending countries are all clustered at around 10 or 11 . ( You can see a full chart at the end of this post . )
