No one disputes that the Big Apple is the shopping capital of the world , but it ' s less well known that certain hotels have close links with the personal shoppers in Manhattan ' s most desirable stores . The Waldorf Towers concierge can arrange for personal shoppers from Barneys or Bloomingdale ' s to come to the hotel , or you can have your in store purchases delivered to the hotel at any hour , leaving you unburdened as you head downtown to shop the boutiques of SoHo and other areas . Not to mention that the Towers apartments have the heady 1930s ambiance of a Fred and Ginger movie .
