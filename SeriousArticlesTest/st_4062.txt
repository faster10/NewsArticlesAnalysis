Last month , Disney released the new movie , Star Wars : The Force Awakens , and I was in the audience the first weekend it opened ( yes , I am just that geeky . ) As I watched the movie I remembered long ago in a town far away ( ok , not that far ) when I was fifteen and fascinated by the very first Star Wars . Of course I was mesmerized by the special effects , the scenes of ships traveling through space , the droids , the technology , and , of course , the Jedi with their lightsabers .
