A few days ago , I went into the new , secret location , super secure offices of Charlie . Being Northern Irish , security was not unfamiliar to me but this was on a different level . It was the villain s lair in one of the dumber Bond films , hermetically sealed , massively protected . And yet inside was a typical small magazine set up ? not many people , untidy kitchen , debatable dress sense . And a bunch of gentle , humble , funny people that I adore . As always when I see Charlie people en masse , there s a giant disconnect . I see a troupe of nerdy sweethearts surrounded by concentric rings of titanic security . They look like kittens in a bunker . I m tempted to say that this is now the world they live in . But that s not what is interesting . The point is that this is now the world you live in .
