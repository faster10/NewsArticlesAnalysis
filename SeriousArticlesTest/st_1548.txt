Tyler Perry ' s A Madea Christmas unwrapped only 16 . 2 million this weekend , marking the lowest ever start for one of Perry ' s popular Madea films and the second lowest start ever for Perry as a director after 2007 s Daddy ' s Little Girls , which opened with 11 . 2 million . The last Madea entry , 2012 s Madea ' s Witness Protection , opened to 25 . 1 million , but Christmas , which cost Lionsgate about 25 million to produce , fell far short of that number . What makes that performance particularly shocking is that advance ticket sales were booming . If there ' s a silver lining , it ' s that , unlike the rest of the front loaded Madea films , Christmas has the potential to hold up nicely in the two weeks leading up to the actual holiday . Audiences gave the picture an " A " CinemaScore .
