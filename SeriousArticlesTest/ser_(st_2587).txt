I have been fantasizing about a trip to Europe for a few years now . My roots are European and I haven ' t been back to Europe for 20 years . I have family in Bulgaria and , I have never visited my mother ' s homeland of Croatia or her birthplace of Austria . France is at the top of my bucket list . I am a hopeless romantic and a writer and , I ' ve never been to Paris . This for me is a travesty . I actually had a trip planned for the summer of 2001 right before 9 11 happened a trip that included France but I became pregnant with my first child and I cancelled my trip . I recently remodeled my master bedroom and adjoining bath to feel like a European hotel room . I have hints of Paris throughout . So each morning and night , I am pretending I am a tourist in Paris in my own bedroom .
