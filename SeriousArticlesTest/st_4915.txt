The Giants had previously ventured into this building twice before in the Tom Coughlin Manning era , with disastrous results : A 48 27 beat down in 2009 , followed in 2011 by a similarly one sided 49 24 setback . WR Rueben Randle came up just short on a play deep down the left sideline on the Giants last series . It s frustrating because I know if I was 100 percent I would have been able to get to that ball , said Randle , who has been bothered by hamstring issues . It just sucks I couldn t make a play for my team . It was a struggle trying to get down there , it was a good ball by Eli , can t complain about that .
