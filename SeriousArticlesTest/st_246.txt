Should the Bengals have ignored the matchup and run the ball anyway ? It ' s hard to say . The numbers in the box certainly favored the throw to Green . If the Bengals just plunge Bernard into the line for no gain and then attempt a 43 yard field goal , there ' s hardly any guarantee that Mike Nugent hits his try . If he misses , we ' re all criticizing the Bengals for being vanilla and predictable with the game on the line , and if he hits , the Bengals are only going to overtime , where they ' re still underdogs to win .
