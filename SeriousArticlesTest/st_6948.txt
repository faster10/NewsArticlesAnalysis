Myself , I ' m old enough to remember when flying used to be fun but not quite old enough to remember when people used to " dress " to fly . But they did . It was an event to go on an airplane . Like going to a Broadway show . Pretty ladies with hats and smiling men in uniforms would bring you snacks , blankets and pillows . Beverages in real glasses . But at some point , the airlines started to lose money , started charging more and giving you less in return .
