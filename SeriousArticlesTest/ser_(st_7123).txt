Somewhere along the line , that formula has been ditched . The IFS said that on average both working and non working households would be worse off as a result of universal credit . It estimates that 2 . 6 million families will be on average ? 1 , 600 a year worse off , while 1 . 9 million families will be better off . This will save the government ? 1 . 5bn a year . A further ? 2 . 2bn will be saved by cutting spending for non working families .
