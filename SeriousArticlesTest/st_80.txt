Nope , it s still a terrible idea . Find the right black actor who can perfectly capture all of Jackson s complexities ? his femininity , his weirdness , his naivet , and yes , his black cultural upbringing ? and invest in better makeup and prosthetics than whoever was in charge of that terrible Man in the Mirror movie . Or cast a light skinned black actor in the role . But casting a white actor in the role is uninspired , an easy way to ignore just how complicated he really was . And if there s anything Jackson taught us , it s that nothing is so simple as black or white .
