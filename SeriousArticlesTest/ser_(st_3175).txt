Of all the GOP economic plans out there , the only one that seems to begin untying the Republican knot ? how to pay for government , not strangle growth , and change the code to help Republican constituencies ? is the one promoted by Sens . Marco Rubio and Mike Lee . Their proposal lowers rates modestly at the top , reduces the number of tax brackets , and dramatically expands the child credit , making it applicable to payroll taxes as well as income taxes . Overall , their plan reduces the tax increases that come with moving from one tax bracket to a higher one , especially for married couples with children .
