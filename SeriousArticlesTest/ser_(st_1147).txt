" I would always write down , on career days , I want to be a football player . But my teacher would always say , Yeah , but you can t put all your eggs in one basket . I remember coming to tears telling her , I really want to be a football player , I m going to be a football player . These are for the people who dream and believe that no matter what another person might say , they know what they want to be . When they re actually living it out like they want to , as with me , I just want to give those people hope . "
