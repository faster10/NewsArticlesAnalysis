One dreamer really stands out in my mind : Helena , a young girl of 23 with cancer . She had a beautiful voice and wanted to be a singer . The Dream Foundation contacted Grammy award winning songwriter Diane Warren and got permission for Helena to record a song in Diane ' s studio . When Helena played the recording back , it was heartwarming to see her smile and be so full of joy . The song not only made Helena happy , but her family happy as well , knowing her dream had been fulfilled . How can you beat that ?
