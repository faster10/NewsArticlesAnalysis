So it was ironic when , in 1988 , I had a bit part in stealing Iowa from that year ' s numerical winner . In 1987 , I had done some informal , unpaid work on Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis ' campaign . I contributed to the speech announcing his candidacy , and , every other week , I hung out at his campaign headquarters in Boston . ( It was a hell of a commute from Los Angeles , where I had moved from Washington , but that ' s another story . )
