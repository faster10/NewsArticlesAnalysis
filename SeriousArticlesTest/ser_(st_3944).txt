" We wish to acknowledge that Jahi ' s case , and our stance regarding her right to life , and her mother ' s right to make decisions regarding her child , has stirred a vibrant , sometimes polarizing , national debate . This was never our intention , " the family ' s statement said . " We have our strong religious convictions and set of beliefs and we believe that , in this country , a parent has the right to make decisions concerning the existence of their child : not a doctor who looks only at lines on a paper , or reads the cold black and white words on a law that says ' brain dead ' and definitely not a doctor who runs the facility that caused the brain death in the first place .
