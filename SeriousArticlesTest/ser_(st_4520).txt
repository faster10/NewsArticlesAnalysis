" Take it all in , man , " Bryant said . " One thing about , if you ' re going to win championships and you want to be a champion inside and out , you can ' t run from very , very tough times . You can ' t run from the criticism . You can ' t run from the fact that you ' re not playing as well as you want to be playing . You ' ve got to stand up and face that stuff , just like when everybody was singing your praises and winning championships and everything is fine . You ' ve got to be able to take it all in , with the same demeanor as you would when you ' re winning . "
