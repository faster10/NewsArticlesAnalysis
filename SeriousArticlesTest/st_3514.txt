Like " The Social Network , " Jobs is a technology yarn that ' s really a high wire business story . The essential tale it tells is that Steve Jobs , in the years after he founded Apple , became so obsessed with creating the perfect home computer product that he turned into a bad businessman , tossing away millions of dollars in research , and bogging the company down while he fetishized perfecting the Macintosh . A lot of the movie is about his battles with executives , board members , and John Sculley ( Matthew Modine ) , the CEO he hires away from Pepsi . They all start off as Jobs ' comrades and end up his enemies . I ' m a sucker for these kinds of big money power faceoffs , and Joshua Michael Stern , the director of Jobs , stages them well , yet with a one thing after another quality that doesn ' t allow any one character to become somebody we care about . Dermot Mulroney plays Mike Markkula , the original investor in Apple , who sticks by Jobs for two decades and ends up getting thrown over the side . I guess we ' re supposed to be drop kicked by this the way we were by Mark Zuckerberg ' s lack of personal loyalty in The Social Network , but the comparison just reveals the difference between the two films . In " The Social Network , " the human drama behind the founding of Facebook is volcanic . In Jobs , Gad ' s deadpan flip performance as Wozniak strikes the most relatable note in the movie , but the only thing we ' re really arrested by , apart from the spectacle of Jobs ' bad behavior , is seeing him talk about computers .
