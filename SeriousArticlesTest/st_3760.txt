Whatever happens in the World Cup , Anderson has a big date in Antigua in April , where he is due to appear in his 100th Test and can celebrate it with the four wickets he needs to exceed Botham ' s tally of 383 . ' I ' m not thinking about the record , ' he said . ' One day cricket is at the forefront of my mind .
