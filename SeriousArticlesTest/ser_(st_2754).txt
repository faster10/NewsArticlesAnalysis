Chiefs fans , meanwhile , must be salivating for a third game against the Broncos . They grossly outplayed the Broncos in Week 2 and deserved to win , only to catastrophically blow the game in a horrific Reidian slip , before blowing out Denver in Week 10 . The downside would be a home game against the Steelers , which isn ' t in itself particularly unappealing . All they have to do is get past the Patriots , which . . . there ' s a reason they ' re third on this list and not any higher .
