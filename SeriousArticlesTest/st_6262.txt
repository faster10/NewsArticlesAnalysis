Mufti Sahib was a much misunderstood man , because he neither sought publicity nor gave candid interviews . Towards his last , he was planning his memoir and he had even fleshed out a framework . But that was not to be . The nation will realise it far too late that they missed the opportunity of using Mufti Sahib as the tallest leader of Muslims in the country and abroad the state will never ever recover his passing away . I have lost a teacher , the best guru I have ever had .
