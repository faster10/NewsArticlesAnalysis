It will be difficult the conditions are impossible for us . My colleagues at the federation are aware that every time we try to restart the soccer world in Haiti an unfortunate situation puts us back to square one . In 2003 we had to stop everything during a political crisis . In 2003 we had Hurricane Jeanne . In 2005 there was the security crisis with the departure of President Aristide . In 2008 there were the four hurricanes of the summer . Every time it is an exodus of talent , the loss of the buying power of the population and each time we have to start from scratch . Fortunately with new players , the work that we maintain with the young players , with the heavy support of FIFA , we climbed back up the ladder because in all age categories our teams are some of the best in the region .
