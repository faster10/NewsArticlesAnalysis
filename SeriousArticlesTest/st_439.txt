This game probably shouldn t scare any Patriots fans . Yes , the Giants share the NFL lead with 13 interceptions and 20 overall takeaways , but their defense also permits an average of 422 . 6 passing yards a game and they just so happen to be preparing to face the game s midseason MVP under center . Tom Brady is second in the league with 339 passing yards a week , first with a 113 . 5 rating , fifth with a 68 . 6 completion percentage and , as important as anything , his 22 : 2 touchdown to interception ratio is obscene . Even without Dion Lewis , the Pats should have no trouble covering the 7 point spread in the Meadowlands .
