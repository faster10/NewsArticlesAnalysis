Can I have a quick word , Louis ? ' No ! ' he scowls . But can we expect to see you in England next season ? No response . Do you think you ' ll go to United ? ' I ' m sorry I can ' t talk about it .

The Press are here and it ' s not nice because I ' m here for holidays and it ' s my last week before the World Cup . '
