" It is extremely difficult to adequately express what Pat Summitt has meant to the University of Tennessee , the sport of basketball and the growth of women ' s athletics nationally , " University of Tennessee Athletic Director Dave Hart said . " She is an icon who does not view herself in that light , and her legacy is well defined and everlasting . Just like there will never be another ( UCLA men ' s basketball coach ) John Wooden , there will never be another Pat Summitt . I look forward to continuing to work with her in her new role . She is an inspiration to everyone . "
