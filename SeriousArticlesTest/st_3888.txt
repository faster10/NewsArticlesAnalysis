It s not the age itself , he explained . Age doesn t bother me . So many of my heroes were older guys . It s the lack of years left that weighs far heavier on me than the age that I am . I feel pretty good frankly . I do what I ve always wanted to do , I m a writer . It s having to let go of it all . Even now , it s so much more poignant . For me , often , there s such a cloud of melancholia about knowing I m going to have to leave my daughter on her ? own . I don t know what age that is going to be , thank God . It just doubles me up in grief .
