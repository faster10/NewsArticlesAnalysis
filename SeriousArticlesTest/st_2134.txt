After I ' d dropped the packages , being careful not to wake the children ( how would that go ? " Oh I was just seeing the Tooth Fairy out . . . " ) , I still felt uneasy . You ' re only a kid once . It ' s fun to believe in this nonsense . I decided to take it up a notch by sprinkling some pink glitter by their bedsides and made a trail all the way to the upstairs bathroom window . No , I hadn ' t been drinking or using recreational drugs . It just felt right at the time .
