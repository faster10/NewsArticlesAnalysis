" You ' re talking about a kid 7 , 8 , 9 years old and his thinking was , ' I can ' t see to catch the ball , I got to do something to make this hat fit . ' So he just turned it around backward and he got used to doing that , " Ken Griffey Sr . recalled on Wednesday after his son was elected to baseball ' s Hall of Fame . " He would come in all the time and turn it around backward just to play catch . And that ' s what was the funny part . A lot of people didn ' t understand it . . . . He never disrespected the game . This was a game he knew and he loved and he enjoyed playing . "
