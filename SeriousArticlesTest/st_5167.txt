This is why I have introduced the Terrorist Refugee Infiltration Prevention Act of 2015 . This constitutionally sound , common sense measure would immediately bar any refugee who is from any country that contains territory controlled in substantial part by ISIS , al Qaeda , or any other designated foreign terrorist organization ascribing to the radical , totalitarian Islamism dedicated to the destruction of the United States and our allies , and whose proponents find anyone who does not share their faith ? from couples dining in cafes to Jews shopping in a kosher market to satirical cartoonists ? equally offensive . The bill specifically names Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Syria , and Yemen as countries from which refugees cannot be accepted , and empowers the State Department to identify and designate additional countries as potential sources of terror .
