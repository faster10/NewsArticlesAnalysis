" All of us served three of us at first for MIS ( the U . S . Army ' s Military Intelligence Service , as Japanese language specialists ) , and two younger ones ( Teiji and Takeo ) for the Japanese navy and army . The youngest ones were stuck in Japan but too young to serve . After the war , Terumasa ( Ted ) and Hidekazu ( Dan ) came back as United States citizens , and when the Korean War started , they volunteered also with the MIS . "
