Three months before leading his team to Monday s college football national championship game , Clemson coach Dabo Swinney was standing in the rain , in front of a national television audience , happy as all hell . And who could blame him ? On this October Saturday night , the Tigers had just won a 24 22 thriller over Notre Dame to remain undefeated and boost their national title hopes . What I told them tonight , a drenched Swinney said during his post game interview , his voice rising as euphoric fans bounced in the background , was , listen , we give you scholarships , we give you stipends and meals and a place to live . We give you nice uniforms . I can t give you guts ! And I can t give you heart ! And tonight , it was BYOG . Bring Your Own Guts !
