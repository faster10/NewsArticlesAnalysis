Again , this is less about highlighting how bad Kobe has been and more about properly remembering how good Jordan was able to be at this career point . Part of that could be a much lower mileage ( Jordan came back with 43 , 000 minutes played , while Kobe is over 55 , 000 ) on his legs , but Jordan also dealt with atrophy from time off , which can , and did , lead to injuries he had to deal with in his comeback . They just weren ' t as serious as what Kobe has had to endure , but injuries and sheer wear and tear notwithstanding , there is a stark contrast between what Kobe is doing now and what Jordan did then .
