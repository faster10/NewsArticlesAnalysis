Payrolls were up 211 , 000 last month and the unemployment rate held steady at 5 , giving the Federal Reserve little reason to rethink their chartered course to commence interest rate liftoff later this month . The prior two months ' job gains were revised up 35 , 000 , with October ' s gains now registered at 298 , 000 , the strongest month so far this year . While soft spots remain in the job market see " watchlist " below and we are not at full employment , we are clearly on that path , as payrolls have settled into a steady growth groove , slightly north of 200 , 000 per month .
