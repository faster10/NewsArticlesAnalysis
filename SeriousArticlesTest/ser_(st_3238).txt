I have a special reason for rooting for Seahawks receiver Doug Baldwin to have a big day against the Panthers . I picked him up as a midseason free agent and rode his surge to a fantasy football championship . Baldwin had a quiet day against the Panthers in week six , with just three receptions for 23 yards and no touchdowns . In the rematch , he won t have Jimmy Graham to distract the Panthers defense . The Seahawks tight end had 8 receptions for a 140 yards in week six but was lost for the season in week 12 .
