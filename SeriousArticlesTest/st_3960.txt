The U . S . military has challenged China s territorial claims before . In 2013 , two B 52 bombers flew through an air defense identification zone declared by China over another set of disputed islands in the East China Sea . And it cuts both ways : Last month , a group of Chinese naval vessels came within 12 nautical miles of the Alaska coast . That was technically legal as international law allows for innocent passage through another country s waters , though it s certainly the kind of thing China has objected to in its own waters . As Gordon Lubold of the Wall Street Journal explains , the U . S . did not claim innocent passage for Tuesday s sail by as that would imply recognition of China s territorial claims in the South China Sea .
