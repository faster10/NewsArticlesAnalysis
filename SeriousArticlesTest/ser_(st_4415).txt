" The food crisis we ' ve seen develop in Haiti over the last 60 days is more serious than any emergency I ' ve seen over my years of work with the country , " Jean said in a statement . " Even where food is available , the citizens of Haiti do not have the resources to buy it and we must take immediate action . I ' m confident that through the commitment of these three powerful organizations , ' Together for Haiti ' will rise to meet this urgent challenge and provide direct relief to the people . "
