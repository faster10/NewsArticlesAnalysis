There is , with any great artist , a little manic ness and insanity . " Tropic of Cancer " is one of my favorite books . And author Henry Miller had this work ethic , where he would get out of bed every day and force himself to write five pages . It taught me that if you do the work , you progress . So many people are content to settle . My dad was exceptionally ambitious . But he had a lot thrown on him , exceeding his ambition . He wanted his band to be successful . But he didn ' t want to be the f voice of a generation .
