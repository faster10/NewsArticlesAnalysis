" We ' re sponsoring some girls and giving them scholarships to get jobs training and English training . English training is very important , because it leads to jobs . It ' s not like a Western egotism thing , like oh , you should learn to speak American . It really is if you learn to speak fluent English , you can get a job as a translator or in a hotel or a restaurant or for an NGO or for any number of different places . It ' s actually a very important skill set to have . So , I love weaving the arts in with leadership , helping give these girls a voice . "
