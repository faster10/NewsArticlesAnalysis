That consistency may be why Breaking Dawn Part 2 didn ' t experience an expected box office boost , despite being the grand finale of the popular franchise . Other finales have earned substantially more on their opening weekends , drawing in casual viewers who want to be part of the pop culture moment . In 2011 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 opened 35 percent higher than its predecessor with 169 . 2 million . In 2005 Star Wars : Episode III Revenge of the Sith ( which was thought to be the final Star Wars film at the time ) started with 36 percent more than its predecessor with 108 . 4 million . But it appears that The Twilight Saga is a different beast . Fans are either in and they ' ve been in for a few years or they ' re not interested .
