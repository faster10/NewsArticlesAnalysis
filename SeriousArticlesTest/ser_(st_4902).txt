All I have are a series of failures monuments to our own stupidity , ideas and prototypes and commercial models failing in the lab , in the field , in a government office , at the VC ( venture capital ) meeting , failing due to some reason from a plethora of reasons in the complex entangled mesh that is India . Slowly , over three years , our team and ToucHb stumbled our way to making the beginnings of impact . We are still stumbling forward , but have been told we are going the right way !
