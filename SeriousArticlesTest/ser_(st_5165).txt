Every time I walk in this room , everyone expects me to win every single match , every single day of my life , Williams told reporters after the loss . As much as I would like to be a robot , I ' m not . I try to . But , you know , I do the best that I can . I try to win every single time I step out there , every single point , but realistically I can ' t do it . Maybe someone else can , but I wasn ' t able to do it .
