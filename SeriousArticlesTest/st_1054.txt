The critics are right , and their cause is just . Affleck should have tried to cast a Latino to play Mendez . That ' s common sense , and it would have made " Argo " a better movie . Affleck also didn ' t do himself any favors by trying to dismiss the criticism with a glib remark that essentially said that it really doesn ' t matter that the actor playing Mendez isn ' t Latino since Mendez himself isn ' t , shall we say , overtly Latino .
