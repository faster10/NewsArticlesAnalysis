The one justice who didn ' t ask a question is Clarence Thomas , who , with one slight exception , has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench . It should be carefully noted here that Thomas is a black man married to a white woman . Anti miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in Maryland . That means that by 1967 , when the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of such laws , bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the American " definition " of marriage for over 300 years . Just 20 years after the Supreme Court struck down the anti miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states , Clarence Thomas and his wife , Virginia , were married .
