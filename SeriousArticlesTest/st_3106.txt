Yet Clinton is clearly looking beyond New Hampshire , which she stands a good chance of losing . After that come Nevada and South Carolina . These are states which , for one thing , have actual people of color in them , states where the other half of the Democratic base s concerns ? like criminal justice , or immigration ? potentially come into much sharper focus . Clinton isn t invulnerable on any of these things , but she evidently senses that she will be standing on friendlier terrain . The less time she has to spend talking about Sanders s key issues ? issues where she will never be able to outflank him or to sound like anything but a calculating uber politician ? the better .
