The Ohio State debate turns into a serious conversation only if ? Stanford ? and either Clemson or Alabama lose . Stanford is the catch , because if it wins the Pac 12 , the Cardinal should be the next team in if either Alabama or Clemson lose , and the committee snubs North Carolina . Stanford would likely get the nod over the Buckeyes in spite of its two losses because of its conference title . If there are two teams with comparable r sum s , the conference title is essentially used as a tiebreaker , though none of the committee ' s criteria are actually weighted .
