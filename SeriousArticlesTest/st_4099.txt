The Droid Turbo 2 uses Motorola ' s very own ShatterShield display , which took the company three years to perfect a five layered design that promises to withstand your terrible butterfingers . It starts with a rigid aluminium core on the inside for durability , and a flexible AMOLED display above that . Stacked on top of those two is a dual touch layer , designed so that , on the off chance that your touch layer does go bad after a bad drop , the second one keeps your phone usable . On top of the touch layer is an interior lens that resists impacts , followed by an exterior lens that protects your display from regular wear and tear .
