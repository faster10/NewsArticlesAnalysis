Some pundits were quick to characterize this new , 34 member , Saudi led coalition as an " Arab NATO , " That assessment was premature . It ' s unclear at this point whether there is a formal treaty between the various parties in the coalition . It does not seem that there is one . Riyadh has made it clear that " participation " in any operation is voluntary . Nor does it appear that the agreement , formal or otherwise , has any binding provisions for mutual defense . As of yet , there is nothing similar to the Article 5 provisions of the NATO treaty that binds each party to come to the defense of any of its members .
