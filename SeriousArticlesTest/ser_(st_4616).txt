Steven Todd of Fort Wayne , Indiana I think Michael Vick will play football again , though at what level is anybody ' s guess . I do not think he should be banned for life . He may have gambled , but not on the game as Pete Rose did . A suspension is in order and I think a year would be fair , but a prison term and suspension would put him out of football for up to three years , and who knows what kind of QB he will be after this ordeal and so long an absence ?
