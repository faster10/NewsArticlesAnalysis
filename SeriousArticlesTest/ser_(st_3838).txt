The end of the Multi Fiber trade agreement saw the volume of textile imports to the U . S . from China more than double from 2004 to 2011 . The phasing out of quota arrangements has led to the loss of millions of textile and garment jobs in industrialized and developing countries alike . For example , in 1980 West Germany had 4 , 055 textile and clothing manufacturers . Now , Germany as a whole has only 690 . As it is cheaper to manufacture in countries that do not enforce international labour standards or pay workers a living wage , textiles and apparel are most often sourced from low wage countries such as China , India and Vietnam . Developing countries need jobs for their growing populations , but they have to be good jobs , without exploitation by companies from the industrialized world .
