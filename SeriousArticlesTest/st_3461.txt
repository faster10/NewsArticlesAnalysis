Too much denial often spells trouble . It offers a quick fix . But at some point , we need to come back to reality . The longer we wade in a sea of denial so that we avoid dealing with the truth , the more tempting it is to stay there . Denial feeds on itself until what matters most is not defending what is true , but protecting what has been fabricated we resort to telling lies , ignoring the warning signs of catastrophe , and manipulating others to validate our choices and behaviors .
