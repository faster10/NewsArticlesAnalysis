Trump has appealed to slices of those voters in the electorate who have " high levels of racial anxiety , high levels of fear of immigrants , and high levels of skepticism about women who make claims of harassment or mistreatment ( this is all within the party ) . This is a different dimension ? a different way to divide the pie if you will ? than we ve seen in recent primaries , " she said .
