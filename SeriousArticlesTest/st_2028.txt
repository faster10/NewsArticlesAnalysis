It ' s important to note : Kyle was not killed by an Iraqi , but according to police , by a U . S . veteran who allegedly had PTSD . It happened long after he ' d returned from the battlefield . He was back home . If people are angry with that or about the fate of the other Americans who suffered in the war , they should focus should not on American Muslims but on those who led our country into a war based on questionable reasons .
