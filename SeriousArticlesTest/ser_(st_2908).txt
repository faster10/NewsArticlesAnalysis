There have been terrorist attacks in Turkey recently . World leaders will be protected because there are very strict security measures . This limits contact with the leaders . As a civil society institution we will be bringing the leaders messages . We ll be telling them not to stay away from the people . We can be communicated with in the same way one communicates with an NGO . We know what the people on the streets think and feel because we work with them . So use us to communicate with society .
