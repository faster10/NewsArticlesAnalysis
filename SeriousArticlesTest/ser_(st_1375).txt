Prime Minister Justin Trudeau : ? What was the number we called for in the spring when we repeatedly saw this government ? ? sorry , the previous government ? ? just wasn ' t doing as much as Canadians wanted them to do . They had modest targets , they brought in a couple of thousand refugees . They were talking about maybe 10 , 000 more . And we said you know what , to make a real significant impact we can talk about 25 , 000 . And it was a number that we felt suited that , what we knew would be a good initial push that would demonstrate to the world and to people looking for a better future everywhere that Canada was engaging , but it was also a manageable number that Canada would be able to integrate and demonstrate success with .
