Haskell : I think a lot of people who are transsexual emphasize the strangeness of it all . For example , the director of " The Matrix " Larry Wachowski , who is now Lana Wachowski , has this wild red hair . My sister is so not like that . This book is an attempt to " unweird " the whole subject . I think it ' s more unnerving to people when the person does just seem so normal , but I do think we have to remember that it ' s not that many people .
