Eric Gordon had another great game with 20 points , four assists and five treys , but you have to wonder how much of a hit his value will take when Tyreke Evans ( knee ) returns next week . The same can be said for Ish Smith ( 11 points , nine assists , eight boards , three steals ) , but he s been terrific and has even been outplaying Jrue Holiday ( eight points , four assists ) lately . Smith s owners should probably be looking to sell high while they still can , but it s possible that he could still have a nice role when Evans is back .
