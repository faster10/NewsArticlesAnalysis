GS : It ' s such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport . If you look at so many other professions in terms of business and politics , across the board the gay community is represented but in football it still isn ' t and I find that disappointing . There may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment .
