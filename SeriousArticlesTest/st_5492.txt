Moss : I ' m also really glad someone brought this up , because I wondered about it too . In the Gospel of Luke , one of Jesus ' disciples says , " Lord , teach us to pray , as John taught his disciples . " It ' s an interesting request that tells us something about John the Baptist ' s ministry and the demanding characters of Jesus ' disciples ! In Luke , Jesus responds to this request by teaching them the Lord ' s Prayer . We don ' t know that the Lord ' s Prayer came from John , and personally I don ' t think it did I think this is just how Luke shaped his version of events . But if you were just reading Luke you could come to that conclusion .
