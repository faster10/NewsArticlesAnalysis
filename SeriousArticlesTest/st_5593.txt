The anniversary of the 7 January attack on Charlie Hebdo is coming up . Whether you feel that Charlie is a symbol of freedom of expression or a scabrous hate sheet , you are about to be deluged in a giant vat of stuff . Some will be positive , some negative but an oxen stunning proportion of it will be written by people who do not speak French . The result will be divination and portent , written by people more likely to read tea leaves than Charlie Hebdo . Do I need to point out that this is a touch silly ?
