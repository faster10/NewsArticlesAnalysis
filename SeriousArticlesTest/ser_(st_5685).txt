It ' s possible . But it doesn ' t seem overly likely for now because the Bengals recently have used their first round pick on players who they believe can be groomed into legitimate starting roles down the line . Cedric Ogbuehi , last year ' s first round pick , for instance , was eased into playing time this year after finishing rehab from a torn ACL he suffered in Texas A M ' s bowl game the previous December . It appears likely he will be the Bengals ' starting right tackle next fall if Cincinnati doesn ' t re sign Andre Smith .
