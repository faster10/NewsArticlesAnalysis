Yanbu Cement , a pure play on the kingdom ' s construction sector , jumped 7 . 1 percent after releasing its fourth quarter earnings on Sunday . Net income rose 8 . 3 percent from a year earlier , according to a bourse filing . " We believe the 8 . 3 percent year on year growth in net income is attributed mainly to higher sales volumes coming from a low base because 2014 ' s fourth quarter was hampered by the changes in the labour market and the lower demand due to the Hajj season , " said a note by NCB Capital .
