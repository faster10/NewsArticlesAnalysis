But why the love for Strang instead of Buting , when both lawyers seem equally competent ? For Blair Koenig , author of STFU , Parents , there was something about Strang s all in commitment to the case that won her over .

He s a thinker and a feeler . In real life , Strang is a board member of the Wisconsin chapter of The Innocence Project , a group which uses DNA and other evidence to exonerate people who have been falsely imprisoned .
