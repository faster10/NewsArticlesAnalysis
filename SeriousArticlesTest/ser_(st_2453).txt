In New Hampshire , Clinton s problem comes from a different part of the political spectrum : independents . Unlike most states , New Hampshire allows voters who have not declared a party affiliation to participate in its Feb . 9 primary . This has supplied Sanders with a decisive advantage . In the new NBC News Wall Street Journal poll , he leads Clinton 50 percent to 46 percent . Independents , who favor Sanders by more than two to one , account for the entirety of his lead . Clinton actually wins registered New Hampshire Democrats .
