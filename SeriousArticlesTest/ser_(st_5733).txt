Thursday means I can . I can visit my family , do some reporting and writing , visit a church or take a class . I can go to a concert and share a drink . I can even take home some rum . I know the politics are complicated . I haven ' t forgotten about Castro and the many people I ' ve met here and there who can never forget the past , or the excesses of the present . But the question hovering above all this is not just whether reconnecting our two countries was the right thing to do , it was whether it will expand the cultural , political and personal view that the two have of each other . I think so it has for me .
