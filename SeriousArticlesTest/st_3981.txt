Ultimately the truth surrounding the fate of Malaysia Flight 17 must be determined , lest we jump to inaccurate conclusions . The destruction of Korean Airlines Flight 007 in 1983 is just such an example . Although indeed a Russian fighter jet fired upon the Boeing 747 , it was later determined that the pilots had allowed the airplane to drift into Soviet airspace by not selecting the appropriate navigational mode on the autopilot . The airspace involved was an area that U . S . airplanes , ( some of them military versions of airliners like the 707 ) traversed nearby to toy with the Russians .
