The Vikings were not supposed to be in that spot this season , with Blair Walsh lining up for a chip shot field goal to beat the Seattle Seahawks . This was a young team and they ' re ahead of schedule . A division title was a wonderful surprise . Green Bay Packers fans will argue but the Vikings should go into next season feeling that the NFC North goes through them . That ' s a huge step for a franchise that had been well behind the Packers for a few years .
