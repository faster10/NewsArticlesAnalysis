10 . An undocumented report that a Narita , Japan bound flight is asked by Ho Chi Minh Center to attempt contact with Malaysia 370 . The Narita flight is approximately 30 minutes ahead but is unable to establish contact with Malaysia 370 . This attempted " relay " would have been a typical procedure used by air traffic control . Ho Chi Minh Center would have first attempted contact on the assigned frequency and then used the emergency frequency that all controllers and airlines monitor . There is cause for concern but no reason just yet to sound the alarm .
