Basically , the system we are all accustomed to in the United States separates insurance from the provision of care . That is , your doctor and hospital and your health insurance company are different institutions . This pits them against one another , because one wants to cut care whenever possible , while the other wants to provide as much care as possible , with little incentive to keep costs down . Integrated systems are simply both they are either insurance companies who own their own hospitals and hire their own doctors or hospital and physician groups that offer a health plan .
