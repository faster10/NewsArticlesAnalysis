" For us it ( social media ) has played a very big role , " says Michael Thivaios of the duo Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike . " We can make a new track and with one click , it ' ll be spread all over the world . Twenty years ago you had a vinyl , and that vinyl had to go to a distributor , and six months later maybe another country would have the vinyl , " adds the other half of the duo , Dimitri Thivaios . " All we did for one year is talk to DJs by Facebook and somehow that got us our first gig . Social media has been the biggest factor in our career . "
