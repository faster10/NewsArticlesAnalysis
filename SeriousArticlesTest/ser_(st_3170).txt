How did we get here ? On tax cuts , Republicans are partly the victims of their own success . Republican presidencies , and the Republican revolution in Congress , have cut a whole lot of taxes , consistently taking more and more families and households " off the rolls " of taxpayer .

That means almost every future GOP proposed tax cut that is aimed at individuals or households will , by logical necessity , " cut taxes for the richest Americans " and " do nothing for the poor . " That doesn ' t play well in Toledo .
