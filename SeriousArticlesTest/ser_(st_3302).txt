Best selling author Sylvia Day ' s first self published title , " Bared to You , " entered the New York Times best seller list in April despite its cover , which featured a profile shot of a naked woman with her arms wrapped across her breasts and a man on his knees , his face pressed into the small of her back . When Berkley Books took over the title in May , the cover art changed to an image of a pair of cufflinks . The title is No . 4 on the New York Times best seller list , right behind the three " Fifty Shades " books , and can be found on bookshelves in Target next to " Fifty Shades of Grey . "
