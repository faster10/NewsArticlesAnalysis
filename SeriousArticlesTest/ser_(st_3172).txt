Perhaps the worst idea , floated at various times by Rand Paul , Ben Carson , and Ted Cruz , is to begin adding more citizens back onto the nation ' s split check through a flat tax .

Needless to say , whatever the claims these candidates make about revenue , the reality of their plans is that they will amount to a massive tax increase on the poorest Americans .
