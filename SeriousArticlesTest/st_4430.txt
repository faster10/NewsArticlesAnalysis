Recognizing the dire straights of the pregnant girls of Sierra Leone , several donor countries , particularly Ireland and the U . K . , implemented alternative classes that began in late October and are funded until July 2016 . Claims are that over 3 , 000 pregnant girls have registered for the classes but they are more than six months behind in their studies . While many girls are happy for the alternative classes , others would like to be able to end the stigma and return to their regular mainstream schools . Even with the alternative classes , visibly pregnant girls are still banned from taking exams .
