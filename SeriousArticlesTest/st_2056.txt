From the tip of Michigan ' s Upper Peninsula , where Lakes Superior and Michigan bracket the road , US 41 follows the latter lake down the coast of Wisconsin and into Chicago . There it veers southeast and wanders through the dense woods of Indiana and Kentucky , which abound in pioneer sites , especially ones linked to Abraham Lincoln . In Tennessee , the highlight is Nashville , the music city , before the road bounces down to Atlanta . In Florida US 41 links the resort towns of the Gulf Coast before cutting due east through the heart of the Everglades to Miami .
