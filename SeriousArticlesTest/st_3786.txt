Lenny explains how it works : " Future Friday is so simple it ' s embarrassing . By Friday at the end of every week you must do something that is good for your future that is a risk or something scary . " For Lenny , " it could be something like getting pap smear , making a dental appointment or telling someone that you fancy them or ring someone out of the blue and asking them if they ' ve got a job . I ' ve done all those things . "
