It ' s very unlikely Brexit will happen . The polls are already tepid , and if one thing is certain , it ' s that as the campaign gets going , the British public will be treated to an orgy of scare mongering the likes of which are rarely seen . All of the country ' s elites abhor the idea of Brexit . And voters have taught us that while they like to tweak the noses of the elites , in the end , they balk at radical change . Greece would only vote Syriza in once the country pledged not to leave the euro ( which was the whole point of voting in a populist party to begin with ) . Scots threw out the Labour bums and replaced them with Scottish National Party politicians in a landslide , a political upheaval ? but then voters still rejected Scottish independence .
