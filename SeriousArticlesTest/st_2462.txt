Trump wrapped up his speech . We are a country that doesn t win any more . We don t win on trade . We don t win on the military . We don t win against ISIS . I mean , when was the last time you remember winning ? Well , under me we are going to win so much . We re going to win the border . We re going to win trade . We re going to win Obamacare , Trump said . We re going to win again . We re going to win at every single level .
