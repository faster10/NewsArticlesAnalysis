Asked if he talked to any team mate about Hayne , Bush continued : ' I spoke to Joique ( Bell ) about him and some of the running backs about him . We actually watched some of his highlight films and he ' s a really good player . I got a chance to watch him play in Australia against the State of Origin . It was really exciting . Like I said , he ' s a great player , he ' s fast , he ' s big , he ' s strong and has everything it takes to play in this league . '
