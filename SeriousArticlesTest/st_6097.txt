I applaud Academy President Cheryl Boone Isaacs for her recent attempts to bring more diversity to The Academy . I applaud Producer Reginald Hudlin on his attempts to make the Oscar ceremony feel as inclusionary as possible . I look forward to working with them both to be a part of positive change going forward . WE must do better . We will . And make no mistake , we have . Even in the midst of this year ' s disappointing results I am emboldened by the fact that we had new and exciting diverse voices and performers along with tried and true veterans that were at least in the conversation . Strides have definitely been made . And it ' s not lost on me that this very weekend the movie that just might supplant one of the highest grossing movies of all time for the 1 spot at the box office is a movie that has two stars , a director and a producer who happen to be black . Happy MLK Weekend everybody . '
