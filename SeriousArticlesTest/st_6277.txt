Williams had worked with Olivier and Orson Welles , so in doing all this wireless work he felt he ' d wasted his life ' making a noise that floats up into the air and disappears ' . It makes alarming reading now , seeing his comments and interjections in cold print and realising that Williams was making comic capital out of a genuine despair . Though it was mock outrage , it was real at some level : ' Oh , I ' m so bored ! ' ' I don ' t care ! Shut your row ! ' , etc . Parsons refers to Williams ' ' precarious ego ' and says he ' performed wonderfully , in a mad , anarchic manner ' , but if we compare the quotations in this book with the screams and howls found in his diaries and letters , what listeners heard was a man teetering on the edge of an abyss like a porcelain cup about to drop off the shelf .
