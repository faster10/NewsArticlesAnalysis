In Game 2 of the ALCS , Kansas City ' s offense looked completely over matched by Toronto Blue Jays left hander David Price . Leading up to the seventh inning , Price had retired 18 consecutive batters following Alcides Escobar ' s leadoff single . But that all changed in an instant when Ryan Goins and Jose Bautista allowed Ben Zobrist ' s harmless pop fly to fall between them . The Jays were holding a 3 0 lead at the time , but the theme here is simple : Any crack in the door , any sliver of hope , the Royals turn it into a victory . The Royals scored five times in the inning and ultimately took a 2 0 series lead .
