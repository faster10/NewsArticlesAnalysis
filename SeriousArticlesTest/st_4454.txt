The Pakistani state is in denial for three main reasons . First , the military establishment does not want to give the impression that their Zarb e Azb operation in the tribal regions of Pakistan is anything short of a complete victory over the terrorists . In essence , most of these terrorists have been pushed to the Afghan territories where they are strengthening the Afghan Taliban s ranks . Secondly , we want to assure the US that IS is not a threat to either Pakistan or the US and that funding should continue to flow to Pakistan and its armed forces . Thirdly , the National Action Plan , initiated after the horrific school massacre in Peshawar in December 2014 , is sluggish on many fronts and has not yielded the desired results , especially curbing funding sources to the seminaries .
