Unfortunately , you can ' t do that without cutting stuff that people like and will definitely notice missing . Sixty percent of the federal budget is spent on just four categories : Social Security , Medicare , national defense and interest on the national debt . That ' s what we ' re spending now , not what we ' ll be spending in 10 or 15 years when our entitlement finances really get out of whack . Many more dollars are spent on things like courts , customs and border patrol , national parks , veteran ' s benefits , and unemployment insurance , things that Republicans have no intention of doing away with . As long as we have those things , we are also going to have to send money to the IRS to fund them .
