So why have I spoken about American politics at such length ? What does this have to do with the Budget Session ? I mean , there are no lessons for our very different country , are there ? Well , let s see . Is there anyone in India who was elected promising to wipe out the Opposition ? Who has a loutish , young support base that intimidates others into silence ? Who has discovered that running a country and pushing an agenda might mean giving up political space you won fair and square to an Opposition you thought you had defeated ? Who is caught between the political style he ran on , and implementing the policies he promised ? If you can think of anyone who fits that description , let me know .
