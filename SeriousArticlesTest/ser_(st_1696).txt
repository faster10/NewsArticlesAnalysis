When Morgan was asked if England should make changes as they play catch up in one day cricket , he said : ' No , absolutely not . We haven ' t got guys who are coming towards the end of their careers . I don ' t see any reason why any of them should retire . I think we have the right calibre of squad . Guys on the outside need to be banging down the door . It ' s an easy thing to sit here while we ' re not doing well and say someone outside the squad is better . We considered everybody when we selected the squad and I still believe we had the right group of players here . '
