The ironic thrust of the movie is that Jobs ' humanity is there in that perfectionistic insanity . He pushes and pushes to make home computers more and more appealing , accessible , and user friendly , and that ' s his great gift to the world . Jobs gets tossed out of his own company because he ' s too far ahead of his time . ( Ultimately , of course , he came back to Apple and triumphed . ) Getting ousted must have been devastating , but Jobs doesn ' t really take us on that personal journey with him . The movie ' s fall and redemption narrative is generic , abstract . And maybe that ' s because the reason that this movie even exists " the notion that Steve Jobs is The One Who Changed Our Lives " has been , to put it mildly , a little overhyped . He didn ' t invent the personal computer , although he did refine it into something more seductively handy and even beautiful . Personally , I ' m a devotee of Steve Jobs ' products , but even as Jobs sticks to the facts of Jobs ' life ( and what a difficult person he could be ) , the movie gets a little too caught up in his legend . Grade B
