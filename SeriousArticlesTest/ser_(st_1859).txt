It almost looked like the Steelers were playing against air on Sunday , instead of the Colts defense . Ben Roethlisberger threw for 364 yards and four touchdowns , DeAngelo Williams rushed for 134 yards and Antonio Brown proved he might be the most exciting player in the game . Brown racked up 118 receiving yards and two touchdowns and then added another score on a 71 yard punt return that ended with an interesting TD celebration that involved the goal post . The Steelers put up over 500 yards ( 522 ) for the second straight week .
