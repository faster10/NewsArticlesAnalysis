It ' s a business trip and it ' s a pretty crazy business trip because like a lot of people on business trips away from home , he has to figure out things with the language , he has to eat food he ' s not used to , he ' s been on a plane and he ' s jet lagged and I liked the idea that there was this crazy superstar having what many of our viewers will recognize as a common experience with the travel and the jet lag and missing your family . LeBron actually invited us . It was the first time he ever allowed cameras on this trip . We had all kinds of exclusive access with him . It was a great example of what " Unguarded " can do .
