A lot of times , these drops appear to be the result of the receivers and Rodgers simply not being on the same page , something that is quite unusual for a Packers team . Rodgers , more than any other quarterback in the league , is often described as a passer that throws the receiver open . He lets go of the ball incredibly quickly , often before the receiver has broken off the stem of his route , so that the ball arrives pretty much in time with the break . When they ' re on the same page , it ' s impossible to stop . ( Just picture that back shoulder throw to Jordy Nelson down the sideline , which Rodgers lets go while Nelson is still sprinting straight up the field . Nelson then turns around and the ball is already whizzing past the defensive back and into his hands . ) When they ' re not , it ' s nearly as difficult just to locate the ball and catch it . For Adams in particular ( but also Cobb to a lesser extent ) , this has been a big issue .
