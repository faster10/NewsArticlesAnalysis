I think there were some really great bipartisan solutions that we reached in the previous term . We saw Medicaid expansion . We saw the approach to provide assistance to the city of Detroit and allow it to emerge successfully from bankruptcy . Those are the kinds of bipartisan solutions that the people of Michigan expect and deserve , and it ' s disappointing that under the current House leadership , we have not seen those kinds of bipartisan solutions . I think the House Republicans have become increasingly dominated by the far right wing conservative elements of their caucus and of the Republican party more broadly . As a result , I think we ' ve seen more partisanship from them , and I think we ' ve seen more ideology and less pragmatism and bipartisanship .
