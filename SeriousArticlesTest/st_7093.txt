Historic Jamestowne , Virginia . The site of the first permanent English settlement in America , the 1607 Jamestown colony is still revealing new information about the site . " Just last year Jamestown announced the discovery of the remains of the first Protestant church built in America , the church where the Native American princess Pocahontas was baptized and married to John Rolfe in 1614 , " Kidd says . " When I visited the site a few years ago , I found it quite moving to stand on the banks of the James River and think of the tiny band of English settlers arriving there , not having any idea the epic history of America that was to follow .
