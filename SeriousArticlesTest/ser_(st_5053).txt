Lampe : Instagram is a great spot for everyday stories . It started with just seeing what our own people were doing in the field . We have correspondents and producers out in really cool places across the world documenting everyday stories . For example , Patrick Oppmann , our correspondent in Cuba , is documenting stories in Cuba that nobody else is doing . It ' s not always something that fits in broadcast , but there ' s a lot of value in seeing that continuing story in Instagram .
