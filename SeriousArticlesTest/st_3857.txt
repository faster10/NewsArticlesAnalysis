The Revd . Preb . Alan Green , Area Dean of Tower Hamlets and Rector of St John on Bethnal Green , who serves as Chair of the No Place For Hate Forum , said : " Whilst I appreciate street art in Tower Hamlets , it must always respect the principles of our diverse community . This mural uses images that have for centuries been used to incite hatred and persecution against Jewish communities . There is no place for such incitement against any community in this borough " .
