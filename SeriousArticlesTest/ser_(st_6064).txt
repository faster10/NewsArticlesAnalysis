Many of the pundits seemed to think that it was also a good night for an oddly rosy cheeked Marco Rubio , who appeared to have guzzled a couple of double espressos before he took the stage and breathlessly answered every question with his patented rapid fire machine gun delivery . And he was ? excessively ? pious , mentioning his faith more often than the Pope did during his recent U . S . visit . But he was also the most bellicose of the group insisting that ISIS is one of the greatest threats in human history and any fighters he captures alive in the U . S . will immediately be shipped off to Guantanamo . It s hard to know what issues he feels most passionately about because he gives every answer with exactly the same frantic emphasis . One can t help but worry he ll end up having a heart attack as president if he doesn t mellow out a little bit .
