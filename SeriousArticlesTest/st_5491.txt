Moss : ( These questions are on a similar topic , so I ' ve chosen to answer them together . ) Actually there is external attestation for the life and importance of John the Baptist . This is important because it ' s fairly rare to find this kind of evidence for ancient figures outside the writings of their followers . The Jewish historian Josephus mentions John the Baptist in his book , " The Jewish Antiquities . " Josephus describes John as a " good man " who possessed " virtue " and had " great influence " over the people . According to Josephus , Herod put John the Baptist to death because he was afraid that he might raise a rebellion . This gives us another arguably more historical perspective on why John was executed and provides further evidence about just how important John was in his own day .
