The residency program is located in Old Dubai . There are a couple of old buildings that are turned into art spaces . I wanted to do something connected to the area , so just a couple of blocks away , if you walked through Bastakiya ( one of the oldest most traditional districts of Dubai ) you would see the fabric shops and I remembered the textile shops from my childhood . My mum would get fabrics and I think this was where my interest in art and colors started .
