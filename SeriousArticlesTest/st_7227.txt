My 11 year old son has never let on that he is remotely interested in girls . Not a word . And he ' s not exactly the middle school kid with swagger . He ' s a relatively shy guy . Yet , his Instagram avatar was boldly flirting with a girl , prolifically posting inside jokes about his crush and inviting commentary not only from his school friends , but also from a far flung social network of kids from Connecticut to New Jersey who I am certain he ' s never met in person .
