There s yet another Republican presidential debate scheduled for tonight , and as we sit patiently waiting for the candidates to take the stage , let s revisit one of the critical moments from the last debate . Jeb Bush , in need of a strong performance and looking to take down Marco Rubio a few pegs , let rip with an attack on Rubio s shoddy attendance record in the Senate . Rubio was ready for the attack , easily deflected it , and then turned it back on Jeb by making him look petty and desperate . It was a disaster for Jeb , and it happened because Bush and his political operation spent the days and weeks leading up to the debate making it painfully obvious that he would attack Rubio along these lines , giving Rubio all the time in the world to prepare and practice his response .
