Lorenzo Giacobbo ' s image on January 30 , 2011 , in Rome is the kind of breathtaking photo the plane spotters yearn to capture . The sky is cloudy and rain showers are painting the clouds . Streaks of light pierce the liquid gray sky and illuminate the metal . " The moment I saw those images that I took of the plane , I was feeling shock and glad at the same time , because I never believe that plane is now gone and I have in my personal collection a copy of the plane , " he wrote .
