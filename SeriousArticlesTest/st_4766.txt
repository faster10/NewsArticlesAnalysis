It ' s even possible , as political scientist Brendan Nyhan suggests , that Palin could push undecided party actors further from Trump . After all , if the nomination really does come down to Trump against Cruz , it ' s going to be a tough choice for many party elites , especially those who have worked with Cruz and can ' t stand him . Knowing that going with the Texas senator will at least have the benefit of annoying Palin might help get them over that hump . In any case , having Trump out on the hustings praising Palin will remind many party actors of the weakness of his attachment to the party and of how little they can trust him either as their nominee or as president .
