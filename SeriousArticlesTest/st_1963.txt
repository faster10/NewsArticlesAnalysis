Injuries are something that is part of the game , and every team has to deal with them . That s when a good front office and coaching staff steps up and figures things out ( Patriots anyone ? ) . As for the poor offensive line play and horrendous WRS ( can t get open , and when they do , they drop the ball ) , I don t see much changing unfortunately . No one to stretch the field , let alone get some ounce of separation . Sigh .
