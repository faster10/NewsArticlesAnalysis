The Supreme Court accepted challenges to an Obama administration compromise for providing birth control coverage to workers at Christian affiliated institutions by allowing the insurer to cover birth control , without the institutions involvement . Dozens of religious employers challenged the compromise , arguing it leaves them complicit in a practice that violates their beliefs . The administration won a string of appeals court rulings , but in September , a St . Louis court ruled the compromise likely violated the federal law on religious freedom . In a recent filing with the Supreme Court , U . S . Solicitor General Donald Verrilli agreed with challengers that the justices needed to intervene and resolve the conflicting lower court decisions .
