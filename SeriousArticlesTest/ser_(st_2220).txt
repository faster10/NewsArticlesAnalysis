Chicago Sun Times Mark Brown : A much more composed Alvarez than the one in the public eye during the past week explained why her office would not be filing charges against George Hernandez , the police officer who shot Ronald Johnson in another incident captured on videotape . I thought Alvarez made a strong case for her decision and that the public will agree , which comes as a relief . Hernandez and Emanuel should fall on their knees thanking the police officer who recorded the shooting on his dash cam video . Both cases are a lesson to all police officers who continue to resist the technology that it s only going to help them if they do their jobs right . That should extend to convincing them to make use of their audio recording capability , which would have been useful in sorting out both incidents .
