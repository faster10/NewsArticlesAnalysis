How we reap what we sow ! Liliana was old enough to know the story of her own origins , and it goes like this : When I turned 39 , still single , I resolved to become a mother on my own and bought eight vials of donor sperm . But then I met her father , Sprax , and he agreed to help me have a baby the old fashioned way . We went through many ups and downs , even splitting up for a couple of years , but finally realized that we loved each other , got back together and went on to have her baby brother . When Liliana was almost 4 , we got married .
