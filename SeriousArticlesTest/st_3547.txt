The Clemson offense was held to 20 points , its lowest total all year , against Louisville in September then 296 yards , also a season low , a game later against Notre Dame . The Sooners picked up two first downs and entered Tigers territory . The play resulted in a three yard loss , but it essentially marked the beginning of the end for the Sooners . Responding to the challenge early , Samaje Perine burst through the first line of defense on the third play from the line of scrimmage gaining 17 yards on the ground . Young guys got some great experience , played some huge plays on this stage and probably made the difference between winning and losing . My main goal was to try to get up there and get it but by the time I got there , the hole was closing and there was too many people there .
