I learned a lesson that day , and you know , as long as you do this , it ' s always about your next play . It ' s always about the next game . So I ' ve never really ever thought too much about all that . I have a tremendous amount of appreciation for all the players who have played for us , came to our school , bought into our program , did the things that they needed to do to have a chance to experience a championship , whether it was at LSU or the four at Alabama .
