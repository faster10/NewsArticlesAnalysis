At the same time , almost everything we see Jobs do that doesn ' t involve designing computers is unconscionable . He ' s so possessed with getting his company off the ground that when his girlfriend announces she ' s pregnant , he treats it as an imposition , something he had nothing to do with , and he develops the ( pathological ) conviction that the child isn ' t his . At work , his inspirational mission statements begin to teeter into harangues . As the movie goes on , Jobs evolves from a grouchy hippie to a corporate sharpie in three piece suits , and Kutcher lets his voice get more and more crisp with grandiosity , so that he ' s not talking , he ' s lecturing , because he ' s the only one who grasps the inner truth of computer design as transcendence . He runs Apple as if it were an est seminar . Anyone who isn ' t a fellow true believer is out the door . ( Even most of the true believers don ' t get stock options . )
