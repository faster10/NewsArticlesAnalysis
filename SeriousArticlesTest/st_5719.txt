In truth , this popular scepticism is the healthiest thing for our democracy . While conservatives are trembling at the notion of Obama taking their guns away and declaring a fascist dictatorship , they simultaneously genuflect at the feet of the cops as though they wouldn t be the tip of the spear should their horny , jackbooted S M coup fantasy take place . Shouldn t we be most concerned by malfeasance when it concerns those who patrol our communities ? I suppose it s easier to demonise the faceless apparatus of the federal government rather than worry ourselves with what goes on under our noses every day .
