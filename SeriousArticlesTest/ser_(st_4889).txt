In the debate , Sanders began by saying , As a senator from a rural state , what I can tell Secretary Clinton is that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what I would hope all of us want . A couple of minutes later , Sanders told former Maryland Gov . Martin O Malley : We can raise our voices , but I come from a rural state , and the views on gun control in rural states are different than in urban states , whether we like it or not . O Malley insisted that the issue was not about rural and urban . Sanders replied : It s exactly about rural . Only one other candidate used the word urban during the debate : former Virginia Sen . Jim Webb . A week later , on Oct . 20 , Webb ? quit the campaign . So when Clinton , on Friday , spoke scathingly of people who call guns an urban problem but mean it s a black problem , it s obvious to whom she was referring .
