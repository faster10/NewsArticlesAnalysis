Few doubt that those orders have come in the Gu case , in all likelihood from the summit of political power in China , the Standing Committee of the Communist Party ' s Political Bureau .

Certain questions must be avoided : What did Bo Xilai know and when ? Can powerful politicians in China cover up a murder ?
