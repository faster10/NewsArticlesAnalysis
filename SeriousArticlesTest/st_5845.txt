Because this version was not mass produced , its pretty rare today . But if you find a copy of the original Atlantis at a garage sale , it might be a good idea to pick it up anyway . The competition cart had the exact same colorful label of the regular Atlantis , but had a small , white sticker slapped on the front that read " Atlantis II . " The label was easily peeled off , so a quick Google search will show you how to determine if you bought a 3 Atari game or a 6 , 000 one .
