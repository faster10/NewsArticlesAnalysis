If the " parbuckling " goes well and the giant 114 , 000 ton vessel is tipped upright sometime in the next week , much more than the 65 percent of the ship that is under water now will be submerged . The platforms that will provide a base on which the Concordia will rest are some 30 meters below the sea level , meaning many of the staterooms that were dry until now will sink underwater . Some of the toxic water will be displaced and pushed out of the upper cabins . Some freezers that are still sealed could burst under new water pressure . And almost every window on the ship ' s outer cabins is expected to break as the ship ' s frame twists .
