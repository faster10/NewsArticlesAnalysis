Some good news came out of the GOP presidential debates last night . It dawned on everyone watching that in a week or so this field is going to be winnowed considerably and we will never have the thrill of seeing the seven dwarves ? Grumpy Christie , Sneezy Cruz , Happy Kasich , Sleepy Carson , Dopey Rubio , Bashful Bush and Doc Paul ? on a stage together again . ( Snow White Trump was pouting across the street , upset over having to take questions from Megyn Kelly . )
