Let off the hook , Carson pivoted from a question about his own integrity into a GOP consensus talking point on Clinton s Benghazi testimony , which went unchallenged by his peers . I have no problem with being vetted . What I do have a problem with is being lied about , and then putting that out there as truth , he said . I don ' t even mind that so much if they do it with everybody , like people on the other side . But when I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton , who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that this was a terrorist attack , and then tells everybody else that it was a video , where I come from I call that a lie .
