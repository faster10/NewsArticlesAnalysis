Playing on the road certainly isn ' t an issue for the Warriors ? Tuesday ' s win ran set a new record for the best road start to a season at 13 0 , besting the 12 0 accomplished by the New York Knicks in 1969 70 . The Warriors also won their 27th straight game counting their four wins to close the 2014 15 season , which ties them with the 2012 13 Miami Heat for the second longest streak in NBA history .
