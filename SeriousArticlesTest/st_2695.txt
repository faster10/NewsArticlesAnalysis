His name adorns schools and street signs . In 1964 , at age 35 , he was the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize . Many Hollywood films most recently Ava DuVernay ' s brilliant " Selma " explore different aspects of King ' s personal and political life , but generally confirm his reputation as a courageous and compassionate crusader for justice . Politicians , preachers , and professors from across the political spectrum invoke King ' s name to justify their beliefs and actions .
