They say Khan is second only to Amitabh Bachchan in wealth . That is a blessed condition because charity , called zakat , becomes compulsory for him after that , to prepare him for high status in paradise , which will have lots of pretty virgins to disport with . There is , however , a minor glitch here . Any charity set up with zakat will not be permitted to help non Muslims , especially Hindus , quite a few of whom inhabit Karachi despite laudable efforts at conversion or migration .
