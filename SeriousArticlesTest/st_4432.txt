Will Smith was apparently a little uneasy about being a sci fi star . Initially , he passed on his role in 1997 ' s " Men in Black " until Jada Pinkett Smith talked some sense into him . Soon after , he was courted for a much more mind bending thriller : " The Matrix . " That ' s right he was the first choice to play Neo and only when he passed did it go to Keanu Reeves . But Will is happy about how things turned out . " I would have absolutely messed up ' The Matrix , ' " he said . " At that point I wasn ' t smart enough as an actor to let the movie be whereas Keanu was . " Instead , Will did " Wild Wild West . " Oops .
