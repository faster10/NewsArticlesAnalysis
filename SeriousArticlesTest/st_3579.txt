For most of the last century , movies and TV in the pre Civil Rights era , always sensitive to race issues and how they might affect box office in the Southern states , either ignored slavery or sugar coated it . Films like " Gone With the Wind , " for example , glamorized the antebellum South . The harsh realities of field work were almost never shown , most slave owners were benevolent , and slaves , most of whom tended to work in the big house , were basically ordinary servants ( who could be bought and sold at will and worked without pay , of course ) , devoted to their masters .
