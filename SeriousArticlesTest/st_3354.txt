A : When I was competing in the Paralympics in Beijing ( 2008 ) , everyone expected that I would get the gold medal in the 100 meter sprint the first of my races . I came in sixth and I was devastated . I was in tears and thought I had failed in the eyes of all those who supported me , including my family . My mom gave me her " signature pep talk " and sent me back to the track to continue competing . . . and I came away with three silver medals and a bronze medal . What I learned was that your family , your friends , your supporters will always love you as long as you do your best and keep on trying .
