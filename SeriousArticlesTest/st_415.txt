We wish you were there on Thursday morning when community members entered their gurdwara for the first time since the massacre . You would have witnessed the spirit of chardi kala in the Sikh faith even in darkness , a rising resilience and shared this spirit , which is also part of the American character . Sikh women and men walked into a crime scene : blood on the carpets , there were bullet holes in the walls , and shattered windows . They flew into action , ripping out carpets , painting over bullet holes , scrubbing floors , and within hours , they served the first langar ( open meal ) , breaking bread beneath portraits of those who have died for our faith .
