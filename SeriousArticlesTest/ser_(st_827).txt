Come to think of it , maybe the English settlers should have been kept out . Despite whatever good feelings led to the Thanksgiving tableau between the Pilgrims and local Wampanoag tribe , the uneasy relationship between the English and the Natives ultimately dissolved into warfare with the many Native Americans on the losing end . As more Puritans , and then many others , arrived in the New World , even more zealotry took hold . Those who deviated from the religious or political norm were banished and dissenting views were silenced .
