Run defense : If the Packers want to rely on their running game more late in the season , then it stands to reason other teams might have the same thought , especially in potential cold weather games late in the season . If that s the case , then at least Dom Capers run stopping unit is trending the right way . Although they still rank 23rd overall against the run , they have allowed just 80 . 0 yards rushing per game over the last two games ? and that includes holding Adrian Peterson to just 45 yards on 13 carries .
