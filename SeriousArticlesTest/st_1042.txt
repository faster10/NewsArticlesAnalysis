IOWA VOTERS DISMISS TRUMP ' S QUESTIONS ON CRUZ CITIZENSHIP . Donald Trump ' s questions about Ted Cruz ' s citizenship may not be helping him in Iowa . In fact , they may be boosting his rival according to one group of Hawkeye State voters , ABC s NICKI ROSSOLL notes . In his latest focus group , pollster Frank Luntz asked if the fact that Cruz was born in ? Canada , to an American mother , raised legitimate concerns about his eligibility for president , as Trump has suggested . Only six of 27 participants raised their hands , even though seven identified Trump as their first choice candidate . One participant said the issue exposes Trump as " unserious , while another called it a joke . " Just a few months ago , he said his strongest lawyers said it ' s a settled issue and Cruz is eligible , " one participant said . " Now three months later , when Cruz overtakes him in the polls , he says the exact opposite . . . It ' s not a serious issue at all . " http : abcn . ws 1kY68aa
