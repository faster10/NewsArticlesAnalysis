An apologist for the Russian state might reply : " What about slavery ? " OK , fair question . American presidents from Abraham Lincoln through George W . Bush to Barack Obama have eloquently denounced and apologized for the crime of slavery . Americans fought a horrific war to arrest and overthrow slavery , and it was the foes of slavery including 180 , 000 former slaves and free black men who won the war , and whose institutions continue to this day . The Sochi opening ceremony did not have to address Russian history . The opening ceremonies at Salt Lake City in 2002 and Atlanta in 1996 did not offer an equivalent pageant . But had they done so and omitted slavery , yes , that would have been a scandal .
