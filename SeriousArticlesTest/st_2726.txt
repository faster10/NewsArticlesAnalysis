Aaron Rodgers is healthy : At least the MVP quarterback isn t on the injury report anymore . He was listed for one week , heading into the Vikings game , because of a right shoulder injury . Then last Thursday against the Bears , he came to the sideline holding his left arm after he got banged on the elbow . He said he finished the game without full feeling his left hand , but that doesn ' t seem to be an issue anymore . Perhaps more importantly , Rodgers doesn t appear to have any lower body injuries , which means he should be able to make plenty of plays on the move . He might need to , given that his offensive line is banged up .
