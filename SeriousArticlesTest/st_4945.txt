" I started in ' 88 to play House music , it was a huge revolution for me . I went to London and I saw a DJ on stage and that was crazy at the time . I was one of the really respected and famous DJs in Paris , but they would never show me . I was hidden . A DJ on stage and people dancing and facing the DJ , looking at him ? I was like ' wow ! ' " says Guetta , as if still surprised to this day .
