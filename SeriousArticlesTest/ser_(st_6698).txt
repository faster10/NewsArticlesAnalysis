The authors propose that ' krak ' always has a meaning of general alarm , but that in Tai it comes to be enriched by competition with ' hok ' ( meaning : aerial threat ) and ' krak oo ' ( meaning : weak threat ) with the result that it is enriched with a ' not ' hok ' ' component ( hence : the threat is a non aerial threat ) and a ' not ' krak oo ' ' component ( hence : the threat is not weak ) .
