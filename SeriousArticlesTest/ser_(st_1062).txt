Each of the cabins has a locked safe , presumably still filled with passengers ' valuables including cash and jewelry . There are also countless cameras , laptops , iPads and cellphones that passengers left behind , not to mention luggage . The ship had only been at sail for three hours , so many passengers likely didn ' t take time to unpack , but instead headed to the nearest dining room or bar to relax as the ship set sail . One suitcase floated to the nearby island of Elba and its soggy contents were delivered to the owner nine months after the disaster . Many more suitcases have been spotted by divers at the bottom of the sea .
