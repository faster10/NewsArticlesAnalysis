" Was I disappointed about Michael ? Winter said , referring to Michael Pitt , who didn ' t get nominated for his portrayal of Jimmy Darmody . Yes , because he was terrific , but who knows how this works ? And we have an amazing supportive cast Michael K . Williams , Michael Shannon , Michael Stuhlbarg , any other Michael on the show . And you don ' t have to be named Michael to be on the show anymore . You can be named Bobby . "
