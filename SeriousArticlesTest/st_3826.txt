In hindsight , though , this Fox boycott seems inevitable considering how Trump has run his campaign to date . Time and time again , the former reality television star has turned what looked like a bluff into an actual campaign strategy ? or , in the case of his decision to finally launch a presidential campaign after three decades of head fakes , an actual campaign . His critics said he wouldn t run , and he did . They said he wouldn t release his financial records , and he did . They said he wouldn t give up his reality TV show , and he did . They said he wouldn t hire the necessary campaign staff , run political ads , or spend time in the early states ? and he did . And so on and so forth until present day , when he s not only still in the GOP race , he s dominating it . Trump may have been bluffing at the beginning , but , regardless , it s clear he now has the best hand . ( And don t forget , those previous debate threats did pay dividends , be it in the form of shorter debates or the removal of unfavorable debate partners like the unapologetically anti Trump National Review . )
