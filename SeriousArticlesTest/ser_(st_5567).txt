Two of seven people arrested in Nov . 14 raids were detained on terrorism charges . Lawyer Carette told RTBF his client Mohammad Amri and a friend were unwitting accomplices who knew nothing about any role in attacks when Amri drove Salah Abdeslam back from Paris to Brussels . Mohammad Abdeslam , brother of Salah and Brahim ( dead ) , was among five released after preliminary questioning . Police searched another six addresses on Nov . 19 in relation to the Paris attacks and detained one . Much of the focus is on Molenbeek , a poor Brussels district that is home to many Muslim immigrants .
