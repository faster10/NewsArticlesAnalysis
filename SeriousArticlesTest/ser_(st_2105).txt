I love how Obama nailed Cooper for that . Way worse than the so called political correctness that Trump assails is the learned helplessness of journalists , public intellectuals and anyone else with half a brain and access to a media platform . Why be disingenuous about knowledge and learning ? Why be defensive about objective criteria for true and false ? Elites making cultural excuses for the popular appeal of proto fascism : that ' s what George W . Bush , who knew whereof he spoke , called " the soft bigotry of low expectations . "
