Start your stroll on Lincoln with coffee at David ' s Caf ( 1654 Meridian Ave . ) . From a large open window facing the street , the cafe keeps the Cuban coffee flowing 24 7 to a wide mix of Miamians who line up for their caffeine fix . Not too much English is spoken here though , so practice the following : cafecito ( a shot of sugary Cuban coffee ) , cortadito ( sugary Cuban coffee cut with milk ) and caf con leche ( a Latin latte ) .
