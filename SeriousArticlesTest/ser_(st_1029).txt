No . The Lisbon Treaty , designed to give the EU a new streamlined constitution for the EU ( and to increase the powers of the European Parliament , ) has been put on ice following its rejection in a referendum in Ireland , the only country to give electors a direct voice . But the Irish are due to vote again in the autumn . If they then vote Yes and all remaining EU states ratify the treaty , then the Parliament will be increased from 736 to 751 members on a different distribution formula . That means that 15 ' ghost MEPs ' , will be elected on June 7 , entitled to attend the Parliament but not to vote in it until the Lisbon Treaty goes through .
