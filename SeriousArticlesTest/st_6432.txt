I would have fought hard in that game , knowing their pass rush is going to make the difference , he said . That whole defense played extremely well , but I would have had to try and cut their legs out from those guys early . I didn t see that . I would have fought for two or three plays where I would line up and just go for their legs and make them think about it early . Then I would have brought Rob Gronkowski in and had him crack one of those guys . Give them something to think about , because I didn t see a lot of that in that game . I didn t see any of it to be honest .
