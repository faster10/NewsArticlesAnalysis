Perhaps the most poignant evidence of the administration s blindness to the threat we face came from Secretary of State John Kerry . Shortly after the November Paris attacks , Secretary Kerry ? posited that there was a rationale for targeting Charlie Hebdo s journalists whereas the November attacks on the Paris nightclub and streets perhaps lacked such a rationale . He attempted to draw a moral distinction between the two , which prompts the question : Is Kerry s theory the reason that no one from the Obama White House marched in an unprecedented show of global unity with more than 40 other world leaders shortly after the Charlie Hebdo attacks ? Obama and Kerry should answer : were they absent because they believe the Charlie Hebdo terror was justified ? That radical Islamic terrorists have a legitimate grievance that it is our responsibility to address ? President Obama claimed the terrorists are attacking us because they don t have access to good jobs and health care . But when innumerable terrorist attacks are preceded by shouts of Allahu Akbar , I can assure you , the solution is not expanded Medicaid in Iraq .
