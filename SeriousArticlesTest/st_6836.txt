" Ted is a constitutional conservative who will fight for faith , family and freedom , " Perkins said in a statement . " He will defend our right to believe and live according to those beliefs . Our families will be protected and freedom will once again mean something in America . I trust Ted to fight to pull America out of the political and cultural tailspin that President Obama ' s policies have put us in . This is no normal election this election is about the very survival of our Constitution and our republic . "
