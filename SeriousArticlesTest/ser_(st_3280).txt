Aside from Daryl , Carol , Morgan , and Rick , Glenn is easily the most likable character on the show , if not some peoples ' favorite character . Yet he suffers the same death that what ' s her name did with the twisted ankle . In the comics , he is brained by Negan , a character that we have yet to meet in the show , but has been alluded to for a while . I completely understand that they want to show that the " untouchable " characters are not actually untouchable , we ' re not even sure what ' s going to happen to Rick , all of the trailers before the season showed all of Rick ' s scenes so far . Next week is a Morgan centric episode . A character like Glenn shouldn ' t have died this way though .
