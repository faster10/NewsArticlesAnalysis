The Giants lost when Brad Wing s 46 yard punt was returned 24 yards by rookie Marcus Murphy . Craig Dahl ran in and yanked the ball loose for a fumble that Willie Snead recovered on the Giants 47 yard line with five seconds remaining . A penalty flag was thrown , then referee Craig Wrolstad announced to the crowd that there was no penalty on the play , which resulted in loud boos when the replay boards showed Wing grabbing Snead s facemask . The officials huddled and decided the penalty stood ? a 15 yarder that advanced the ball to the 32 yard line . Kai Forbath then nailed the 50 yard field goal as the clock ran out .
