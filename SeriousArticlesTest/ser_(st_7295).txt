And that means Seahawks coach Pete Carroll will apparently have a chance next season to again roam the sidelines of the stadium he called home during his time as head coach at USC from 2001 2009 before coming to Seattle in 2010 . Carroll was 97 19 overall at USC and went five full seasons ? 2002 to 2006 ? without losing a game at the Coliseum . And it s not hard to envision a Carroll return to LA getting a lot of attention , maybe even national TV treatment of some sort . ( The NFL back in Los Angeles could also lead to rumors of Carroll returning there someday to finish his career ? but that s probably a topic best left for another day ) .
