I felt like deep down inside that ( the Cardinals ) thought I couldn t do it , said Ginn . They sent me back out to the wolves . But then ( Panthers coach Ron ) Rivera , ( general manager Dave ) Gettleman , ( owner Jerry ) Richardson , even ( quarterback ) Cam ( Newton ) , they stood on the table and said , hey , we want this guy back . All I can do is go out and play as hard as I can .
