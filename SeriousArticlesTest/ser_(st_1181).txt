Sports are supposed to be fun , and the Panthers are having a ton of it . Their only loss came after the week that wasn ' t fun after Josh Norman and the Giants ' Odell Beckham Jr . had their game long melee and people were accusing them of threatening opponents with a baseball bat . That knocked the Panthers out of their rhythm for a week , but they ' ve clearly found it again , with Newton giddily manning the wheel of a party bus bound for Santa Clara , California .
