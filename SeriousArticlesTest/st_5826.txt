This opens up an interesting prospect . Western governments and media have claimed , ever since they started on 30 September , that Russian air strikes were directed at supposed moderates who were fighting Assad . This was largely propaganda , but it was just plausible because the strikes were initially directed mostly against non Isis ? forces in Latakia and Idlib , where the Syrian army had suffered defeat earlier in the year . But if the Russians and the Syrian army directly attack IS in central Syria , how will the US , Britain and France respond ? It will be difficult denounce it as one more cynical manoeuvre by Moscow . ?
