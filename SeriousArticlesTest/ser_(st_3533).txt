I went to a meeting in 2010 when environmental officials were talking about dealing with PM2 . 5 , she continued . So it s not that they didn t know what they were doing , or that change happens only because of public opinion . The reality is that it s not just the public living in this highly polluted environment , it ' s also high government officials ? so every time the air gets really bad , they have to explain what went wrong to their bosses . And when you re in such a top down system , that makes a difference .
