As a reflection of the rest of pop culture , something it has captured for nearly 30 years , MTV has embraced geeks in a big way ( the sitcom " The Hard Times of RJ Berger " will start its second season soon , and there ' s even a site called " MTV Geek " now ) . In fact , even though MTV means " Jersey Shore , " " Teen Mom " or " The Real World " to most , it has had its moments over the years of standing up for nerds ( " Squirt TV " among them ) .
