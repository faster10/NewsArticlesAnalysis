Sanders got seriously annoyed with the Washington Post , who ( like a lot of media these days ) are getting worried that Bernie might actually beat Clinton . The Post editorial board put out the snarkiest of hit pieces on Sanders ( titled , with no subtlety whatsoever : " A Campaign Full Of Fiction " and subtitled : " Sen . Sanders is not a brave truth teller . He ' s just telling progressives what they want to hear . " ) . Sanders then struck back , but it ' ll be interesting to see if this sort of thing becomes more common if Clinton loses Iowa and New Hampshire to Sanders . There are many in the Democratic establishment who fear a Sanders nomination just as much as their Republican counterparts fear both Cruz and Trump .
