Start in a neutral all fours position with your hips over your knees and your shoulders above your wrists . Engage your deep core muscles to stabilize your low back . Extend your right leg straight out to the side with your toes pointing forward and the sole of your foot down . Exhale as you sit your hips back toward your heels as far as you can go comfortably without knee , hip or back pain . Inhale as you bring your body weight forward again and internally rotate from your right hip to come up onto your toes ( as pictured ) . Be sure the rotation is coming from your hip , not your lower back , knees or ankles . Exhale and return your hips back towards your heels and the sole of your foot to the floor . Repeat the movement in synch with your breathing through five repetitions on each side .
