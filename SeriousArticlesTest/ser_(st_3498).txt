Yes , Ryan voted in the past against the Cuban embargo . He comes from the Midwest , where the thought of selling farm goods to the island is appealing . His Cuban American colleagues from Miami , including Congressmen Lincoln and Mario Diaz Balart , say Ryan had a genuine conversion after they sat down with him and explained the realities of the totalitarian Cuban government . He has since then voted in favor of maintaining the embargo . Ryan should explain his change of heart or risk Democrats taking advantage of his past record to suppress the vote of Republican Cuban Americans .
