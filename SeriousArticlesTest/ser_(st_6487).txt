While the staff issue appears to have been the biggest factor , one report suggested the Eagles wanted Coughlin to keep former Eagles running back Duce Staley on as his offensive coordinator ( and possible heir apparent ) . One NFL source also uggested that Coughlin wanted a measure of control over personnel that the Eagles were leery of giving after their fiasco with Kelly last season . And it s also possible that Coughlin ultimately decided he didn t want to be in the NFC East and face his old team twice per season , though a source familiar with Coughlin s thinking had insisted that wouldn t prevent him from coaching next season , especially if that was his only option .
