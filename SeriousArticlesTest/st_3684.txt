" My goal with the study of elections is to move things as close as possible towards ' Moneyball , ' which is to say I want to measure what ' s going on , I want to measure the background conditions and the fundamentals that are important in any election , like the economy . I want to measure the news coverage , I want to measure the campaign advertising , all of the things that convey information to the voters about the candidates , and then finally I want to measure the voters themselves , I want to understand why they made the choices they did and what impact , if any , the campaign had .
