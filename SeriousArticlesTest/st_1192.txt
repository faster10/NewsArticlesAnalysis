Now , I for one have no problem with the Iranian president visiting the enlightened world as part of his nation s effort to rejoin the global community after ( allegedly ! ) abandoning its nuclear terror ambitions . I can t wait for Rouhani to come to New York ( maybe he can go see The Scream at MoMa ? you know , so he can see what the rest of the world thinks of him ) . Our city will certainly find a way to remind him what a glorious mess Democracy is .
