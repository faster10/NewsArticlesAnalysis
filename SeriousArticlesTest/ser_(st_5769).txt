" We also have a Blind Spot Monitor that uses radar to examine the area just to the rear and to the left of your vehicle , " added Bart Herring , product manager for Mercedes ' S Class and CL Class . " So when another vehicle , or any object , enters into that blind spot , a red indicator light in your side view mirror lights up . And if you start to change lanes while that other car is in your blind spot that also triggers an audio alert to warn you . "
