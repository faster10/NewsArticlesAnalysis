We are asking people who support us to " call in gay " to their workplace by taking the day off or to shut down their businesses . Our goal is to raise awareness that we are gay and lesbian Americans who work , own businesses , pay our taxes and support the economy to the tune of 712 billion a year , according to an analysis by Witeck Combs Communications , a public relations agency that specializes in the gay and lesbian consumer market . This is a declaration that we take our rights seriously and demand full equality .
