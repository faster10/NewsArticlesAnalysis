Democrats , of course , can be expected to welcome the news that Trump at the top of the GOP ticket might make things a heck of a lot easier for them , down ticket . Trump might just hand the Senate to the Democrats , in fact .

Doom and gloom predictions aren ' t usually espoused by members of the same party as the frontrunner being denounced at least not this early in the process .
