I rarely meet adults who know about pangolins that is , unless they have young kids . Children are so much more curious about and engaged with the natural world , and , if my friends ' kids are a barometer , a growing number of them seem to be learning about the pangolin in school . I ' d encourage you to talk with your kids about the pangolin see what they know and what they don ' t . If your kids are little , read " Roly Poly Pangolin " to them . Save Pangolins co founder Keri Parker suggested kids ( or adults , whatever . . . ) try out this pangolin coloring sheet . Parker also recommended parents make ant shaped cookies with their children in honor of the pangolin ' s ant based diet .
