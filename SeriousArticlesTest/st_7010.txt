Writer Paul Kupperberg , with input from myself , has crafted an emotional , impactful and classic story that I know will survive the test of time . This isn ' t a random one off or " what if " story that we ' re doing as a gag . This is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought . This is the death of Archie as we see it , and we ' re treating it with that same level of gravitas and import . It ' s a once in a lifetime event , and we are being very considerate about it .
