Every time a media commentator sniggers at her strangled syntax ? as I ve done here ? it enables her to say to those voters : They re not laughing at me , they re laughing at you . The same goes for Trump . Mock him as an absurd blowhard , giggle at his inability to distinguish Hamas from Hezbollah if you like , but to the constituency he s winning over it only makes him more , not less , a man of the people . We may want to howl with laughter when Palin says of Trump , the multibillionaire son of a property magnate , he s spent his life with the workin man . But he s casting himself as an outsider , and right now enough people are buying it .
