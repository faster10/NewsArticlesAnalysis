At the border , the only sign of an EU commitment was the fading paint jobs on the Slovenian army s vehicles . Of the first five German police officers who arrived in Slovenia , as part of a forthcoming EU force of 400 announced on Sunday , there was no sign . We ve not seen any German police here . Last week we had 12 , 000 people cross in one day . Many had no shoes or winter coats , I did not feel like I was in a technically advanced and modern European Union then , said Bernarda Avsenik , a teacher from the capital Ljubljana , who is volunteering at the border .
