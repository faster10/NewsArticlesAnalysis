' I was happy to play on the Saturday . We ' ve not tried to gain any advantage we ' ve been told when to play . TV controls a lot of things . If the game definitely has to go ahead on the Sunday then can we all then move to the Sunday . I ' d be happy with that . I would imagine that it will be changed over the next 24 or 48 hours to play at the same time . It would be only right . '
