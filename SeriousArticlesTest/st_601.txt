The Patriots don ' t have the well known names in their secondary , other than perhaps S Devin McCourty ( 32 ) and Super Bowl hero CB Malcolm Butler ( 21 ) . If Denver ' s bunch of WRs led by Demaryius Thomas ( 88 ) , Emmanuel Sanders ( 10 ) , plus TEs Owen Daniels ( 81 ) and Vernon Davis ( 80 ) can remember to hold on to the ball after so many drops against Pittsburgh , they could have success through the air .
