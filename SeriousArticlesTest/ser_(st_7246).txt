It was also the latest evidence of a resurgence in the fortunes of the rebels . After being penned back into a shrinking corner of eastern Ukraine around the cities of Donetsk and Luhansk for much of July and August , they are now advancing on several fronts . Last week the army of NovoRossiya , as it now calls itself , seized Novoazovsk , a town on the coast a few miles from the Russian border . Those fighters have begun to push west and north , while others have captured more territory south and east of the city of Donetsk . The rebels have established a corridor from the city all the way to the coast in which there is no sign of Ukrainian forces .
