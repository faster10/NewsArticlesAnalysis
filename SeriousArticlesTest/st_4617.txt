Jennifer Runyan of Fayetteville , North Carolina I think the whole Michael Vick case is disgusting . The NFL needs to ban him permanently . He shouldn ' t be able to use the obscene amount of money he makes to torture innocent animals . Kids looked up to him and how many of them will think that abuse is OK now ? I don ' t think he deserves to play ever again . I applaud the people sending Michael Vick jerseys into the Atlanta Humane Society to use cleaning the kennels , now that ' s appropriate ! Watch what a dog thinks of his Vick jersey
