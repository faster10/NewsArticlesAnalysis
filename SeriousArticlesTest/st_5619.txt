She is jealous of him too . On the rare occasions when my now quite strapping son plonks himself next to me on the sofa , Matilda is there in a flash , sitting between us , one paw placed possessively on my knee . If I am styling his hair or helping him with his tie , she presses herself against my legs , needing to be part of the goings on . And I love it . Who doesn ' t get pleasure from feeling wanted and needed , and knowing you are the centre of someone ' s world ?
