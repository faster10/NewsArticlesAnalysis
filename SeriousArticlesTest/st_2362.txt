It s a good thing Grease has those gangs , because they gave the production its best moments . Keke Palmer lit up the screen in a well staged Freddy My Love , and it seemed to spark the rest of her performance . Carly Rae Jepsen had a sweet moment with a new song written for this production , though the song itself fit neither the period nor the show ? and was a particularly odd juxtaposition ? with Beauty School Drop Out , ? which ? followed . And Hudgens , whose Rizzo was softer than the norm , did a fine job with her big number , There Are Worse Things I Could Do .
