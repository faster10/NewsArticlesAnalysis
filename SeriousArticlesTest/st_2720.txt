Enough is enough . In the absence of VA action , I authored legislation that would make certain veterans are not dismissed or forgotten just because of where they live . The Veterans Access to Community Care Act of 2015 ( S . 207 ) would require the VA to utilize its authorities , including the Choice Act , to offer community care to veterans who are currently unable to receive the health care services they need from a VA medical facility within 40 miles of where they live . This legislation enjoys broad bipartisan support in Congress and has been endorsed by numerous veterans ' organizations , including the American Legion , Veterans of Foreign Wars , AMVETS , Vietnam Veterans of America and the National Guard Association of the United States .
