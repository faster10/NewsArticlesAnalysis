Frankly , as I ' ve said before , I don ' t think any of this is going to happen . This week ' s election is over , but there ' s always another series of elections around the corner .

Who would worry ? For one , probably Hillary Clinton , who is eager to run for president in 2016 but not eager to take the blame for executive action taken by the previous president .
