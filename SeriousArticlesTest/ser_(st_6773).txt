The revelation adds to speculation that poor husbandry on the part of the airline , Metrojet , was to blame for the disaster in which 224 people died , rather than terrorist activity . Russian and Egyptian officials have downplayed claims that the plane was brought down by terrorists , but as yet they have not released any data from the plane s flight recorders , which were recovered over the weekend . The company again insisted that neither mechanical nor human error had been responsible for the crash , despite anecdotal reports that staff had expressed concerns about the plane s condition in the days leading up to it .
