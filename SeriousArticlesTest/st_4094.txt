That s not the only factor that makes Iowa results hard to interpret . At national elections , vote share matters . In Democratic caucuses though , it s state delegate equivalents ( SDE ) that count and those are calculated based on how many county delegates candidates manage to amass . That means that even if Iowa were demographically similar to the rest of the US ( it s not ) , results here wouldn t necessarily be indicative of national sentiment . Confused ? I m not surprised , but this video should help .
