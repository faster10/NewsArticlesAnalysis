According to Robertson , the DNA of AAFCA s critic s awards can be traced back to the so called Black Oscars , an underground awards show held by performers of color starting in the 1970s ( a decade where no African American won an Oscar ) to honor actors who were routinely being overlooked by the Academy Awards . Over the years , stars like James Earl Jones , Whitney Houston and Samuel L . Jackson gathered to pay tribute to one another at the unofficial ceremony . The show was disbanded in 2007 after a series of victories for African Americans suggested a turning of the tide , but in the 80 plus year history of the Oscars , only 15 black performers have won in the four acting ? categories , including just one best actress winner .
