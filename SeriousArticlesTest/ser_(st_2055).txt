One of the great American road trips , this fabled road starts at the Canadian border in Maine and goes all the way south to the tip of the nation in Key West , Florida . Along the way it traverses 15 states , including 12 of the original 13 colonies . It hugs Connecticut ' s shore , razors across New York City , crosses Washington DC and hits the old south at Richmond , Va . Its rural meanderings in Georgia pass towns little changed in decades before it joins the balmy Atlantic coast in Florida and follows the beaches all the way through Miami and on to the Keys .
