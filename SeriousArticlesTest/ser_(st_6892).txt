" There ' s definitely a lot of tightening up , " Ali said . " There ' s a few people that I know that have apps that are relatively small , and they ' re selling them for valuations lower than what they could ' ve sold them for a month ago , and there are just no buyers in the marketplace . I think they ' re going to have a hard time selling , period forget trying to sell at a lower valuation . They ' re just having a hard time getting rid of them . "
