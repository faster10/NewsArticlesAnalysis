" It ' s about time , " Sarah Kate Ellis , president of GLAAD , said in a statement . " Discrimination has no place on America ' s streets , least of all on Fifth Avenue . As an Irish Catholic American , I look forward to a fully inclusive St . Patrick ' s Day Parade that I can share with my wife and children , just as my own parents shared with me . Until then , parade organizers must be held accountable to ending this ban once and for all . "
