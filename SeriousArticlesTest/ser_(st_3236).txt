The Seahawks utilize a defensive scheme that is heavy on pressure but light on the blitz . As Robert Mayes at MMQB ? pointed out before the playoff game at Minnesota , the Seahawks were second in the regular season in percentage of snaps bringing pressure , while only a handful of teams blitzed less often . The Seahawks don t deviate a whole lot in their front seven and what they are called on to do . As previously mentioned , Bobby Wagner is back ( as is defensive end Frank Clark , who also was out for the earlier Panthers game ) . Even shorthanded , Seattle managed to sack one of the NFL s most elusive quarterbacks four times last October , and slowing Seattle s pressure will be a Panther priority .
