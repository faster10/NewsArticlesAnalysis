The drafting of Fuller or any receiver would hinge upon other free agency moves the Bengals make in the next couple of months , too . It seems unlikely they will hold on to both Marvin Jones and Mohamed Sanu , so in the event they lose one or both to free agency in March , Fuller ' s drafting would make sense as it would shore up a position that would suddenly be depleted . Would the Bengals want to entrust a rookie with the task of starting next season as the No . 3 receiver behind A . J . Green and Tyler Eifert , though ?
