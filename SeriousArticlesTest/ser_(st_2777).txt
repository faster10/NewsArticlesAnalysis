But 2007 was the turning point for Brady going from a very good quarterback with multiple championship rings to a consistent fixture as a league leader in most passing categories . Before 2007 , Brady had one 4 , 000 yard season , never threw more than 28 touchdowns in a season or had a passer rating above 93 . Starting in 2007 ( and not counting his 2008 season that was mostly lost due to injury ) , Brady has had fewer than 4 , 000 yards only once , fewer than 28 touchdowns only once , and has posted just one rating of less than 96 . In 2007 Brady put up one of two 50 touchdown seasons ever , and in 2011 he put up a 5 , 235 yard season that ranks third all time .
