The legal question is better framed like this : Negligent parties are generally liable for all the harm that is foreseeably caused by their negligence . When a person is negligent , it means they undertook some activity , and their conduct fell below a standard of care in performing that activity . Sometimes , however , a defendant can act negligently , but the subsequent harm to another person is caused by a completely independent intervening cause . This will break the original chain of causation , absolving the defendant of liability .
