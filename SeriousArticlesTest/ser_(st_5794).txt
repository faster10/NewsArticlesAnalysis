Nationally , however , the numbers are not budging much . At pollster . com , Rubio stands at around 9 . 5 percent , which is basically the same place he stood a month ago . The RealClearPolitics poll tracker has him slightly higher , but at just 11 percent . The latest NBC , post debate poll also has him at 11 , which is about where he s been in that poll for the past month . Quinnipiac has him slightly higher , at 14 percent . Rubio is making incremental progress ? and probably benefiting from the decline in Jeb Bush s polling support ? but he s hardly lighting the world on fire . In fact , even in his home state of Florida , where he is currently the junior US senator , he s at 16 percent , behind both Trump and Carson .
