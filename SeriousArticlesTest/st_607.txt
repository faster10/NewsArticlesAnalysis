Hillary made her case that she s a progressive who gets things done , offering herself as a realist contrast to the idealistic fervor of Sanders and his political revolution ? at one point she even said outright that I m not going to make promises I can t keep . Clinton had an effective retort to the Sanders campaign s effort to impose an ideological purity standard on the race , ticking off a number of popular Democratic politicians and liberal icons who would fall short of Bernie s definition of progressive . And , as has become commonplace , she demonstrated a far greater depth of knowledge and fluency surrounding foreign affairs than Bernie brings to the table . It was the Hillary pitch we ve been hearing for well over a decade now : pragmatic , tough , and focused heavily on her own record of accomplishment .
