Mom and Dad bought me Monkees records . I read Monkees interviews and through them , learned about a guy named Jimi Hendrix who was their opening act in cities I couldn ' t get to . I saw Frank Zappa of the Mothers of Invention on the Monkees TV show and in their movie , " Head , " and soon I ' d moved from the innocuous to full blown dangerous rock ' n ' roll . Things that are for everyone sometimes suck us into things that aren ' t for everyone .
