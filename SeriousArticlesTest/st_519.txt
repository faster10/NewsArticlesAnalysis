" Although we were not able to shatter that highest and hardest glass ceiling this time , thanks to you it has 18 million cracks in it , and the light is shining through like never before , filling us all with the hope and the sure knowledge that the path will be a little easier next time , and we are going to keep working to make it so , today keep with me and stand for me , we still have so much to do together , we made history , and lets make some more .
