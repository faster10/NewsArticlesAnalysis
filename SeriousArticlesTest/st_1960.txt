Four women are not an insignificant number . One or two anonymous charges , perhaps . Three anonymous charges ( where , as I understand the story , Cain knows of at least two of the women ) plus one woman who went very public and opened herself up to all manner of investigation are a lot . It is no longer insignificant . Neither is it insignificant that the Cain campaign discounted the charges in the initial stories , saying they were based on anonymous sources , only to make a mockery by blaming other campaigns with less substantiation than the original stories .
