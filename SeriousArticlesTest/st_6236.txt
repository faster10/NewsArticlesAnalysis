I don ' t question the intentions or integrity of Iowa caucus goers . They ' re just rising to the opportunity our system offers to participate in the nominating process . It ' s not their fault that a year of meaningless polls has tracked their every evanescent preference . It ' s not their choice to be targeted by a fusillade of ads or hunted by battalions of ground gamers . But the 100 million that campaigns and super PACs are spending in Iowa is terrific for their state ' s economy , and if those citizens ' unrepresentative demographic has been arbitrarily elevated by party hacks and media elites to a sacred status , well , who could refuse an offer like that ?
