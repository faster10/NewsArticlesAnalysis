There are other minor obstacles that Khan will of course overcome quickly , given his popularity in Pakistan . He will recall that he has made a number of films in which he has acted as a Hindu icon , a king putting non Hindus to the sword , or a commando of the Indian army , killing Pakistani mujahideen and , still worse , seducing Muslim girls . In one especially despicable film , he even crosses the border illegally and comes to Lahore in pursuit of a Muslim beauty . This will be compensated by making good Pakistani films showing him piously massacring Hindus
