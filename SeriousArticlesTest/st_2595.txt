Please wrap your head around this for a moment . I ' m only talking about those killed . I ' m not even talking about those maimed and disabled . I ' m not even talking about an entire infrastructure of a nation destroyed . Jobs , security livelihood LIFE . Destroyed . Do you think if a foreign power came to the U . S . borders and destroyed our nation and took out hundreds of thousands of our citizens bad things would happen ? Or would it be rainbows , unicorns and apple pie for dessert ?
