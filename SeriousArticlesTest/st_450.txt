Sure , there ' s plenty of talk of one intelligence team member , nervous about the mission , who wore a Red Cross symbol against orders . But other accounts confirm the use of something you can probably pick up at any mall : a Che Guevara T shirt . That ' s right , the same T shirts you see Hollywood celebrities , starving pseudo artists and confused hipster teens wearing around local coffee shops . To all those who decide that you want to be coffee house communist chic , remember this : When you are wearing a Che T shirt , you ' re wearing the same shirt that makes terrorists believe you ' re just one of the gang . I hope that latte is tasty .
