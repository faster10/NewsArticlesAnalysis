The body of a dead Marine being prepared for viewing by his family had a badly damaged arm sawed off because it could not be arranged suitably for viewing purposes . The bone had fused at a 90 degree angle , according to officials . The report said Quinton Keel , a Dover mortician , had the arm sawed off without consulting the Marine ' s family . The Air Force found no wrongdoing and officials say preparing badly damaged bodies can be very difficult . But the federal Office of Special Counsel , which also investigated the matter , said the family should have been notified , according to a statement issued by that office Tuesday .
