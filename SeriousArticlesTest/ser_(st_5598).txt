A few years ago , before a football match , I was with some guys in a cafe , waiting for someone who was late . I whined about not wanting to miss the kick off . Calme toi , said the others , On attend le fran ? ais . The French guy ? At first , I thought I d missed some juicy bit of French slang . But I was with two Arabs and a black guy ( all born in France ) . We were waiting for a white guy . Thus , le fran ? ais .
