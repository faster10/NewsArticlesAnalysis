What followed was anything but vintage Manning . Rather than fly down the field the way his teams once did in such situations , the Broncos rolled on the legs of running back Ronnie Hillman who chugged slowly through an aggressive , slashing Steelers defense . Manning threw one significant pass and it was perhaps the one real good pass he threw all night . It flew not like a laser but straight and hard nonetheless to Bennie Fowler who caught it near midfield for 31 yards . Everything else was a dirty , ugly fight .
