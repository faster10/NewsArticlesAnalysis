Last month , I visited the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea as part of a Human Rights Foundation project . From the vantage point of the DMZ , the importance of Truman ' s courage is as visible as the light and dark that divide the thriving democracy of South Korea from the horrifying gulag of Kim Jong Un . It was a reminder that the Korean people ' s fight against communist aggression was supported by the United States , which sacrificed nearly 37 , 000 lives there , and that 50 million South Koreans live in freedom today because of that support .
