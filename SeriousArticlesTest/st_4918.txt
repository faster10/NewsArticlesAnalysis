The only way to argue with that is by confusing the issues , twisting the situation into something it was never intended to be . It ' s gotten so bad , some folks don ' t want their kids exposed to the president because they ' re afraid he ' ll teach them socialism . My answer is that even if he did plan to discuss socialism , they should let their child listen . Of course , the president wouldn ' t do that , but why is that my answer ?
