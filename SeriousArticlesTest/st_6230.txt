In Uganda , the Martyrs Shrine is being spruced up before the papal visit on the middle leg of his tour , with drains cleared and roads paved . Portraits of three popes ? Paul VI , John Paul II and Francis ? stand close to the shrine . Many will be watching the pope s speeches carefully for comments on the issue of homosexuality , which is illegal in Uganda . A law signed last year by President Yoweri Museveni compelled citizens to report suspected homosexual activity to the police , triggering increased levels of prejudice , violence and discrimination against the gay community . The law was later annulled , but is expected to be reintroduced .
