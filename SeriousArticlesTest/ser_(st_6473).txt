Arizona , even with a Week 17 flop , has all the pieces in place to make a run : an MVP caliber quarterback in Carson Palmer , an aggressive offense led by coach Bruce Arians and a defense that can get after opposing quarterbacks . The Cardinals also have something else in their favor : added motivation . They were considered to be among the favorites last season before Palmer tore his anterior cruciate ligament . This could be their year . The Patriots , meanwhile , even though they ' re weakened by injuries , still have far and away the best quarterback in the AFC playoff field in Tom Brady . But if they make it to Santa Clara , Calif . , Arizona presents a tough matchup with athleticism on a defense that can match New England ' s pass catchers , with the exception of tight end Rob Gronkowski .
