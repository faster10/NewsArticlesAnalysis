The CAR is a country in dire straits , described by many as an active warzone between Muslims and Christians . The situation is so dire that there are serious questions even today about the Pope s security given continual violent clashes between the warring armed factions . There is a largely Muslim anti government rebel group known as Seleka , which brought much destruction when it took over many local villages in 2012 and 2013 , leading to its seizure of the capital . That destruction led to the formation of a counter militia , largely Christian , known as the Anti Balaka , to fight Seleka .
