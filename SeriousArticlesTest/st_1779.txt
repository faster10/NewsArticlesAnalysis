" When the FTC raised concerns in April 2012 regarding the way research findings for Almond Beautiful Shape and Almond Shaping Delight were communicated , we immediately took steps to review our advertising and marketing processes , and cooperated fully with the FTC . As a result of the FTC inquiry , L ' Occitane has implemented a set of even more rigorous policies and procedures that will guide future clinical testing and ensure that our marketing and advertising comply with FTC regulations and guidelines .
