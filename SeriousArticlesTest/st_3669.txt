According to Cohn , Monmouth ' s polling director Patrick Murray said : " I don ' t feel this is 2008 . . . I don ' t think we ' re going to get that big number who have never participated in a primary before . " Edwards Levy says Murray " noted in an email that Democratic caucus turnout in Iowa has varied substantially over the past four decades , and said that he based the poll ' s turnout model on the 2000 contest between Al Gore and Bill Bradley . " ( You ' ll recall that wasn ' t exactly an inspiring primary and that cycle ' s general election gave us George W . Bush . Maybe Murray thinks we should be getting ready for President Trump . ) In other words , they didn ' t think it was important to include , as Edwards Levy put it , " first time caucusgoers , voters who aren ' t affiliated with a party , or those who vote in presidential caucuses but not most primary elections " demographics that were instrumental in Obama ' s 2008 victory , and who are likely to support Sanders .
