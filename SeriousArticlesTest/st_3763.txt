If you work hard both on the practice field , in the team meeting room and during games ? you play . If you dont bring it all the time , then you sit on the sidelines . If you dont get your act together you wont get re signed or if you do , it will be for the minimum contract . If you cant play for the Pack , the only team that will pick you up will probably be the Jags or the Dolphins , they take chances on anybody .
