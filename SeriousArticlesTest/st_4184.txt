' We ' ve got the two best goalkeepers in the world in my opinion both fighting for one place . It ' s difficult . You can ' t keep them both happy . The manager manages to do it , I don ' t know how . Obviously they both want to play all the time . But the two of them are at the top of their games . Rotating them is a tough job . I ' d rather that was the manager ' s decision . '
