Sure , the earlier films in the series had gaping lacks in logic , many of which were gleefully exposed by Mike Myers in the Austin Powers movies . ( Anyone who can explain the plot of The Man With the Golden Gun is smarter than I am , and I ve easily seen it 30 times . ) But those films were not trying to be serious movies . Blofeld was always a camp figure , but here he feels out of place . Even worse , the film literally stops dead with several boring debates about the merits of drone warfare and NSA like surveillance vs . good old fashioned spying . The script s idea of being pro ? civil liberties is to romanticize the notion of British secret agents going around the world killing anyone they please .
