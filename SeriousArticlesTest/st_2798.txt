In his Hall of Fame career , the Los Angeles Lakers icon has missed 14 , 151 shots and counting . Why will nobody topple this ridiculous feat ? For starters , a news flash : missed shots don t help teams win , so to even put yourself in consideration for a run at the crown you best have good will built up in your back pocket ? most likely in the form of several early career championships . You ll probably have to be one of the greatest players who ever lived , too . So , good luck with that . ?
