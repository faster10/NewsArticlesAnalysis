" It ' s for me not to go out and prove it to myself and not to nobody else that I ' m capable of doing the things that I ' m accustomed to doing , " James said . " So I look forward to the challenge . There ' s a lot of questions about my health and about my durability and things like that over the last couple weeks . So it ' s just all about my mind frame and how I approach the game and how I approach practices and how I approach my team when we go out there . We will be great , and how great is up to us . "
