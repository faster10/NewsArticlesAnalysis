I think it ' s very important to take care of your skin . Obviously the No . 1 thing is sunscreen . All my life I have used Oil of Olay as my daytime moisturizer because my mom did . I also use their foaming face wash . It ' s the best makeup remover ever . And in the morning I use Olay Age Defying Daily Renewal cleanser because it has these tiny microbeads that are great for exfoliating . People go , " You have such great skin ! " and I ' m , like , " Thank God I ' m not spending 150 on products . " I ' m sure that stuff is great , but if it ain ' t broke , don ' t fix it . E mail to a friend
