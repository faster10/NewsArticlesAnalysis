Moss : I ' m so glad someone brought up DNA . The DNA tests on the Bulgarian bones yielded only mitochondrial DNA ( DNA passed down by the mother ) , not the more reliable nuclear DNA ( the kind of DNA referred to in forensic investigations ) . In the original study of the Bulgarian relics ( of which I was a part ) the mitochondrial DNA revealed that the Bulgarian relics were of " probable Semitic origin . " Thinking back to my time in the laboratory with the Copenhagen scientists , I recall that the lead investigator estimated that the probability was about 75 . The episode last night stated things a little too sharply when it said that the bones were from a Middle Eastern man .
