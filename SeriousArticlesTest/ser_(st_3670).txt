This is establishment bias in almost pure form : despite an immediate , recent example in which certain demographics were decisive , Monmouth arbitrarily decided Sanders ' explosive grassroots support ( which often outstrips Obama ' s pace ) would not translate to a similar turnout at the polls , and so polled in a way that excluded those demographics . Put simply , establishment bias like Murray ' s determined Monmouth ' s polling methodology , blithely cut essential Sanders supporters out of the picture , and , surprise surprise , Sanders didn ' t do as well .
