" To have Roger and Rafa Nadal playing and Novak Djokovic has now been the dominant player and Murray ' s getting closer it ' s a great time for tennis , an interesting year . Is there a guy coming through who is going to to dethrone those guys ? I don ' t think so . Berdych , Tsonga ? Yeah , they have their moments up to that level , but I think it ' s a little bit like the ' 80s with McEnroe and Lendl those guys played each other all the time , and we ' re seeing that today .
