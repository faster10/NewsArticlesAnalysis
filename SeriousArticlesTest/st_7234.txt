Anyone who saw the first two sets of Djokovic s semi final with Roger Federer will have appreciated it as some of the most outstanding tennis we have ever seen , not only at the Australian Open . As the great Rod Laver said here on Friday : It was just quite incredible the speed he was getting around the court and being able to hit great shots down the line , just an inch inside the line . When Roger came to the net , Novak had all the answers and he played beautifully . As important as matching his tennis is matching his intensity . If Murray comes out a little flat , for whatever reason , he is unlikely to have enough about him to win if , on the other hand , he gets pumped up , in Djokovic s face at times and generally stands up to be counted , he might just have a chance to win the title here , at the fifth time of asking .
