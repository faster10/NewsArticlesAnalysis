Things got kind of intense . They dug into each other s differences , trying to make sound untrue what is patently obvious to the outside observer : Sanders is a stubborn college professor , obsessively dedicated to principle Clinton is a bureaucrat s bureaucrat , doggedly focused on process . And frankly , neither candidate is served by a debate . This isn t an election where adulation for a candidate s ideology swept the other nominees , la then Senator Barack Obama in 2008 . This is an election between two pragmatic , prickly politicians , two grandparents who have been in public service for decades . Debates make them fighters . And while this head to head match up was long overdue , the first segment of the debate was honestly exhausting to watch , especially after the introspection of the informal town hall . Perhaps the Democratic party is just a little too bleeding heart to revel in the bloodsport of two strong liberal politicians trying to take each other down , but it certainly seemed that every attack made from one candidate to the other looked mostly bad for that candidate when Clinton railed against Sanders for his artful smear of her politics , she was booed , and when Sanders dismissed Clinton as a shill of the establishment , he dismissed for the obvious fact that a woman candidate for president is a revolution in and of itself .
