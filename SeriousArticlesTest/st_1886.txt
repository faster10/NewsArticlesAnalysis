It s an honor to get here , Collins said before the Mets were eliminated Sunday night . What it took to get here is grueling . When you are here you better enjoy it . Yeah , we re going to be frustrated if we don t win . That s natural . This is an honor and exciting to be here . Can t let the frustration get in the way of what it got to be here . That part was the grueling part , that part was when it s all said and done , the fatigue is gonna kill you . 162 ( games ) , getting to the World Series .
