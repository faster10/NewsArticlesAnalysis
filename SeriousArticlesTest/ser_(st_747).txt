Already , Mr Trump has had a damaging effect on the Republican Party brand . He sows fear and division , with a chuckle . Attacks on Muslim Americans ( from a proposed database to flagrant lies about thousands and thousands cheering the destruction of the Twin Towers ) may have boosted Mr Trump s poll numbers , but will cost the party come 2016 . So will attempts to exploit the San Bernardino shooting . The Muslim vote swung Florida to George W Bush in 2000 , winning him the election , according to the totemic GOP activist Grover Norquist ( and , indeed , voting data ) . Even if a moderate candidate wins the nomination , it will prove difficult to rebuild bridges so gleefully burned by the Donald . The Hispanic vote , at about 17 per cent of the electorate , is more crucial still association with Mr Trump ? who backs building a great wall on the Mexican border ? can only diminish the GOP s chances .
