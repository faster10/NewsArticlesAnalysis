Bush needs to show he WANTS the Republican nomination and is willing to fight like hell for it . The problem for him and this has always been Jeb ' s problem is that he has always been a sort of awkward candidate , more suited to being governor ( or president ) than running for the office . He ' s not a natural emoter or fighter he ' s an introvert ? who tends to be more reserved in public . All understandable . But all also part of the problem he currently has in this race where people just aren ' t sure how much he wants the job and , even more importantly , why he wants the job .
