There s no question things have changed dramatically since the team announced his diagnosis in August , back when it quoted his doctors saying the cancer was very treatable and curable . Since then there have been changes to the way his body handled the chemotherapy ( and maybe how much cancer they ve found ) that have made it life threatening . Everyone involved has gone radio silent because of the family s request for privacy and federal patient privacy laws , etc . , but between the complete silence , the lack of people visiting as far as I can tell apart from his immediate family and very inner circle while he remains hospitalized here in Minneapolis and the things I m hearing second hand , well , none of it is good .
