Watching Logan go through a pregnancy with Tamara and Brent ' s baby inside of her felt , " Weird . Different , " says Tamara . " Particularly for me because not only had I somewhat experienced pregnancy , but mine had been cut really short . In many ways , I was so excited and happy and joyful that we were expecting a child but on the flip side , I did sometimes feel a pang of not regret but just wishing that it could be me . I felt a little bit cheated out of the pregnancy experience . I know that some people may not understand that and I really am thankful , but I ' ve also come to realize that it ' s normal to have these feelings . "
