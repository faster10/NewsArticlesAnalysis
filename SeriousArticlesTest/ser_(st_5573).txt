To me , bottom line , it will come down to the success of what the Thunder do this season , said Hall of Famer Reggie Miller , now an analyst for TNT . If they win and they get to at least the Western Conference finals or the NBA Finals , I think it s no question he stays . But if they falter and for whatever reason there s injuries or they get upset , which could very well happen in that loaded Western Conference ? if they lose in the first or second round ? I could very well see Kevin Durant jumping ship and going somewhere else .
