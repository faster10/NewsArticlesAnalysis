Luxurious floor to ceiling velvet curtains create intimate spaces inside the Violet Hour , discreetly hidden behind an unmarked , wood paneled door . Circles of high backed leather chairs and the warm glow from crystal chandeliers and working fireplaces encourage conversation . So does a strict no cell phones policy . Eight kinds of ice shards , crushed and cubes of varying shapes are tailored to specific drinks , which gives an idea of how seriously this bar takes its cocktails . A favorite is the Juliet and Romeo , Beefeater gin with mint , cucumber and rosewater ( 12 ) . theviolethour . com . Budget Travel gallery : See the bars
