It is our loss in Britain ? in both great and small ways ? that political speech writing remains mainly an amateur affair . We have the talent . Blair had Phil Collins , Scottish Labour has Blair McDougall ? they are two of the finest speechwriters I know . We don t have the progression , the recognition , the career . And we should have . Wouldn t it be so much better if more of our politicians could more often speak to our better natures , call forth a bigger and more generous country and make the hair on the nape of our neck stand up ?
