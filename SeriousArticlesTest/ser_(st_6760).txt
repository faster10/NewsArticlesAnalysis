His candidacy , which is a movement it s a force , it s a strategy . It proves , as long as the politicos , they get to keep their titles , and their perks , and their media ratings , they don t really care who wins elections . Believe me on this . And the proof of this ? Look what s happening today . Our own GOP machine , the establishment , they who would assemble the political landscape , they re attacking their own frontrunner . Now would the Left ever , would the DNC ever come after their frontrunner and her supporters ? No cause they don t eat their own , they don t self destruct . But for the GOP establishment to be coming after Donald Trump s supporters even , with accusations that are so false . They are so busted , the way that this thing works . We , you , a diverse , dynamic , needed support base that they would attack . And now , some of them even whispering , they re ready to throw in for Hillary over Trump because they can t afford to see the status quo go , otherwise , they won t be able to be slurping off the gravy train that s been feeding them all these years . They don t want that to end .
