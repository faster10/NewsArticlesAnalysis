Keenan sipped his coffee in rainy Westport in the far west of Ireland ? he was born in Belfast ? and spoke slowly , almost philosophically . He rarely gives interviews . The Paris slaughter had happened only 16 hours earlier . The contagion has broken out of its confinement , he said . Someone has planned all this for a long time . There is a lot of organisation ? but it doesn t take much of a commitment to kill people . What happened doesn t surprise me . What surprised me was that what happened in Beirut 24 hours earlier spun to Paris . It s as if the culture of victimhood which is rife in the Middle East has risen to new levels , legitimising the worst horrors .
