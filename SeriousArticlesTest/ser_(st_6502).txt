One more ingredient was essential for the experiment : the ability to look back in time . It takes a very long time for light to travel to us from these supernovae , which are rare occurrences in distant galaxies . Light from a nearby supernova might take hundreds of thousands of years to reach us , while light from the distant ones sought by the Perlmutter and Schmidt Riess Kirshner teams travels for billions of years . This means that looking at supernovae or galaxies at different distances maps the expansion history of the universe that is , the rate at which it was expanding at different times in the past . Measuring the change in expansion speed the deceleration was the experimenters ' goal .
