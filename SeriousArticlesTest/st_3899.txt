" Sidney Lumet will be remembered for his ability to draw great performances out of his actors , his technical talents as a filmmaker and his zeal for the arts , " Bloomberg said in a statement . " I was lucky enough to know Sidney we spoke just last week . I let him know that we intend to honor him this June with the ' Made in NY ' Lifetime Achievement Award . Sidney will now receive the award posthumously and I will ask his daughter Jenny , also in the movie business , to accept it on his behalf . "
