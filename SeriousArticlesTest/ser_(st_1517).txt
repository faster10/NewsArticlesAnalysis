Anywhere in the world they ' re deployed and the president does expect . That they can have an impact in intensifying . Our strategy . For building the capacity of local forces incited Syria to taking the fight on the ground to Beisel in their own country . War that has been the core element of the military component of our strategy from the beginning building the capacity of local forces on the ground . That was the essence of the call that that the president just complete with prime minister body we knew . The United States their coalition partners have worked effectively with the central government of Iraq . They ' ve got community control of Iraqi Security Forces in that country in because . Training and advice and assistance that the United States are coalition partners have been able to offer . To those Iraqi Security Forces we built up the capacity of Iraqi Security Forces to be more effective . On the battlefield inside of Iraq . The situation in Syria is quite different . The United States are coalition partners do not have a central government with whom we can partner . The Assad regime has lost legitimacy to lead that country for a variety of reasons in fact it actually use the military back country to attack innocent civilians . So with the United States are coalition partners have been focused on doing is enhancing the capacity of moderate opposition forces on the ground inside Syria .
