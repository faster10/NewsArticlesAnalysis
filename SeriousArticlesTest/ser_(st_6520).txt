As for the first part of your question , the Panthers aren t significantly different . But they are significantly better . Newton and offensive coordinator Mike Shula have a full grasp of what this zone read offense can be . That s why players such as wide receiver Ted Ginn Jr . , who was almost invisible with the Cardinals last season , looked like a Pro Bowler with 10 touchdown catches . Newton also is healthier than he has ever been that s why you ve seen him run at a record pace . But mostly Newton is seeing things like blitzes better than ever . He s making smart decisions . He has become a complete quarterback perhaps the most dangerous quarterback in the NFL because he can beat you in so many ways .
