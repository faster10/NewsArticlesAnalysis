Other comparisons between " Eclipse " and " Breaking Dawn " are hard to draw . " Eclipse " opened on a Wednesday and was a summer movie , while " Breaking Dawn " debuted on a Friday and is playing during the Thanksgiving season . Furthermore , both of their runs contained holiday weekends in the first two frames , which make weekend to weekend drops difficult to compare . For the record , though , " Breaking Dawn ' s " three day weekend drop was 70 percent from last week ' s 138 million opening . One thing that can be said with certainty ? The " Twilight " franchise remains a box office juggernaut . " Breaking Dawn ' s " 10 , 330 per theater average was the second highest in the Top 10 , and when all is said and done , it should finish its run in the 300 million range .
