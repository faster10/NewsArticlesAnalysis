As someone who has had a front row seat , I sure as hell don t want to see the progress we made go backward , Perez said during a visit to a Las Vegas union office for some phone banking in December . And that s why , folks , I m going to say I m proud as hell of the fact that I have had the privilege of working for Barack Obama and I m proud as hell to endorse Hillary Clinton to be the next president of the United States .
