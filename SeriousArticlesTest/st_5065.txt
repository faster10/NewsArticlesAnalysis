Toughest season , by win percentage : USC . The popular consensus is that USC ( vs . Alabama , vs . Utah State , and vs . Notre Dame ) , UCLA ( vs . Texas A M , vs . UNLV , and at BYU ) , and Stanford ( vs . Kansas State , at Notre Dame , and vs . Rice ) have the Pac 12 ' s toughest nonconference slates . So I crunched last season ' s opponent win percentages to gauge which team ' s slate shaped up to be the most difficult . The Trojans face the toughest battle by far : Their 2016 opponents including Pac 12 foes were a combined 101 58 ( . 635 win percentage ) , while UCLA ' s were 86 67 ( . 562 ) and Stanford ' s were 83 72 ( . 535 ) .
