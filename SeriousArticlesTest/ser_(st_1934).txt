( On what effect Kam Chancellor s holdout had on him as a player and the season : ) Well I think it was hard for him to just ? he had to endure the starting part of the camp in season . You do that in preseason . You get two weeks , and then you get another four games . You get six weeks , and then the seventh week . He had to just go through that with us , and playing a lot of plays too . Usually you can ease into that , so it was more taxing on his body . He handled it well . He dealt with it very well . His attitude was good , but still it s demanding . It s a lot to ask of somebody . It was like if you just started playing , what s going to be the fallout of that . So he had to endure that , and stay the course and all that , and he did a nice job of doing that .
