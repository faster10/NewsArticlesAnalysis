NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has made it clear that the NFL will not tolerate this type of violence or any bounty systems . His indefinite suspension of Williams and separate suspensions and punishments levied on the Saints were meant to send a loud and clear message to the rest of the league as well as fans of the sport that the NFL takes this issue seriously . On Monday , Goodell stood tough and rejected the Saints ' appeal and upheld the season long suspension of Saints Coach Sean Payton and two other team executives .
