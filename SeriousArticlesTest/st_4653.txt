One of the coolest parts of this new industry is just how customizable printed products can be . A Japanese company called FabCafe can turn a quick scan of your body into a 3 D gummy bear like version of yourself . Or you can use the same technology to create a mini action figure of yourself . Think of all the possibilities for children to have their own toys replicated after themselves , or for brides and grooms to have the ultimate custom cake topper . The possibilities are endless .
