More than 15 years ago , cardiologist Gordon Ewy and researchers at the University of Arizona ' s Sarver Heart Center were puzzling over how to get more people to give CPR . To simplify the method , they wondered what would happen if they advocated performing compressions without mouth to mouth respiration . After running successful laboratory trials , Ewy spoke to emergency services directors in Arizona , Wisconsin , and Missouri . They were intrigued by his findings and agreed to promote the use of compression only CPR among people in their states . They also implemented a protocol for their paramedics and firefighters that emphasized giving chest compressions with minimal interruptions to keep the patient ' s blood circulating .
