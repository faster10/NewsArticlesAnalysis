We had asked this government to come prepared with the necessary legislative agenda to implement Ambedkar s vision of social justice . The levels of discrimination and attacks against the Dalits seem to be growing . Since the BJP government assumed office , atrocities against Dalits have gone up by 19 . A total of 40 , 300 cases of atrocities were reported under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Atrocities Act during 2014 . Till 2014 , a total of 108 , 659 cases were pending for trial with a conviction rate of 28 . 8 . Such is the reality as we approach Ambedkar s 125th birth anniversary ( April 14 , 2016 ) . Are we anywhere near redeeming our pledge to realise his vision of social justice ? Statutory status must be provided for SC ST sub plans . There are at least 10 necessary pieces of legislation that this government should have enacted in this session .
