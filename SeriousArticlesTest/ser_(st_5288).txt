I sidestep the brawling children and enter the home of a woman who has suffered more than most . A long standing resident of Cit Soleil , 83 year old Elevanise Tidor was first caught in gangland crossfire in 1993 . In 2004 she stepped into harm ' s away again when she was shot in the breast and stomach . As she undoes her faded dress to show the scars from her mastectomy , she tells me she was later hit by a car and now can hardly walk . Watch Elevanise Tidor tell her story
