As if a dominant defensive performance weren ' t enough , Cam Newton added insult to injury . The probable league MVP did on Sunday what he ' d done all season . He stood high in the pocket , delivering on time and on the money . He found Greg Olsen and Ted Ginn and Corey Brown and Devin Funchess for chunk plays to move his team down the field . He hit Brown for an 86 yard TD and fired another to Funchess from five yards out . He made every one of his rushing attempts count , as he found the end zone twice on the ground as well . He looked like every bit the league MVP he did for the 17 previous games the Panthers had played .
