Clemson ' s offense has been phenomenal and is by far the best that this Alabama defense has played . I really don ' t think it matters , because this Alabama defense is that good . They can hang around and keep it close with their defense , but after early red zone woes against Oklahoma , I ' m not so confident that Clemson will turn the rare trips into Alabama territory into touchdowns not field goals . It ' s hard for me to see the Tigers breaking 21 , so I like this under .
