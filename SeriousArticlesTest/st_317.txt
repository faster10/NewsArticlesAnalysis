' It ' s easy to say now that I saw it coming , but I felt like I was playing well again , and have been hitting the ball like I wanted to . To win takes so much more than just playing well though , as there are so many good guys out here , so you could say I got lucky in the end , as I holed a great putt on 15 to win by one . I ' m just overwhelmed and happy , and can ' t wait to go to Czech Republic next week .
