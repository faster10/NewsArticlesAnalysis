I love the South Bank there is always something going on down by the river there . It ' s home to some of our greatest cultural institutions like the National Theatre , the Hayward Gallery , the British Film Institute , the Royal Festival Hall . There ' s also the famous outdoor book stall and the skate park with its funky graffiti and groups of young skaters . You can check out the food market down there , hit up great bars and restaurants and visit the Christmas market in December . Plus , you get incredible views of The Thames , St Paul ' s Cathedral , Westminster Abbey , Big Ben and central London . You can just stroll along and take in the view .
