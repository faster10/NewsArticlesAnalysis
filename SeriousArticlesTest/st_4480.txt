The tension in the air confirmed that every fan understood that this moment was critical . The Brits held off , first with Andy slapping a forehand at the net , then forcing deuce with a forehand slam . Belgium earned three more break points , but the brothers refused to go down . At the fourth deuce , Andy showed that he had no interest in keeping this going . He slapped a volley at the net to take Britain s first advantage , then sealed the final point with a ballerina esque move as he sent a backhand across his body . A hold to love made it 4 2 , then a second break gave Jamie the chance to serve out the 6 4 , 4 6 , 6 3 , 6 2 win . ?
