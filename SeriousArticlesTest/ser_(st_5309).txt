Gervais , no matter what you think about him as a comedian , is the ideal person to host a show like that . With his did I do that ? smirk , he has unlocked the key to a successful awards show hosting stint : be as bored as everyone else . The Academy Awards have failed to find someone to host their show who s been able to garner the same media approval given to Gervais or Tina Fey and Amy Poehler . That might be because the Oscars producers are desperate to maintain a veneer of respectability and Globes producers are greasing the wheels and praying for a 12 car pile up . Neil Patrick Harris , Ellen DeGeneres , Hugh Jackman , and even Seth MacFarlane all had to present the Oscars like the Queen s Diamond Jubilee . It s Hollywood s biggest night , after all . Gervais , on the other hand , always looks like he s trying to find a dank , smelly cave to hide in and a bottle of cheap whisky to chug as soon as possible .
