The only thing your kid is likely to get from being outside in the cold is . . . cold . " When I was growing up , my grandmother insisted I bundle up in even slightly cold weather because ' getting cold could make you sick , ' " says Sue Stevens of Arlington , Texas . " I knew from my school health class that she was wrong and that germs make you sick .

" That ' s because only cold and flu viruses cause those illnesses .
