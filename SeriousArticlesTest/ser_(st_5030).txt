And let ' s be honest , these types of buffoonish " brownface " stereotypes would not be permitted if it were any other minority group . What would the reaction be if a white actor in blackface mocked African American culture ? Or if an actor of Arab heritage pitched a movie about the leader of a fictitious Jewish state in which he would portray the Jewish leader and showcase the worst stereotypes of Jews ? Is there any chance that film would get the green light from a Hollywood studio ?
