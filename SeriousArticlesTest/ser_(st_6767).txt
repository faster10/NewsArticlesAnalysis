How could Americans have allowed their government to fly prisoners suspected of terrorist connections to " black sites " in Thailand , Morocco , and Poland , where , as the report describes , they were hideously tortured in the hopes of extracting information from them about future plots against the homeland ? ( And people did know that something like this could be going on , as reporters often described the existence of shadowy rendition programs without knowing the specific details . ) Is this how tax dollars were best spent to protect Americans against future threats ?
