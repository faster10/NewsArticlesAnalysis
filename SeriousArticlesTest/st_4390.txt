If Trump were a normal candidate , no one would take a third party threat seriously , since an independent run would doom his own party while offering himself no path to the White House . The new USA Today Suffolk University poll he boasted about on Tuesday suggests he might be able to retain nearly 7 in 10 of his current supporters . There s plenty of reason to doubt that retention rate would actually be so high , but even if we generously assume he would be able to keep all of his fans , he d still have no chance at victory . To state the obvious : If Trump doesn t have enough support to win the GOP nomination , he won t have enough to win a general election . ( To say nothing of the fact that it takes considerable time and money to get your name on state ballots , or that so called sore loser election laws would likely prevent him from even appearing on the November ballot in Ohio and Michigan if he runs in the states GOP primaries this spring . )
