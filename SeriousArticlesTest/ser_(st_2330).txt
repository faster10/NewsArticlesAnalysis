The virtues of Western governments are equally imperceptible to many Muslims who are not radicals . It ' s not hard to see why . Consider the descendant of Algerian immigrants to France who cannot find work and confronts racism and poverty in a country that demands not just his obedience to authority , but his respect and esteem . Or the descendant of Turks in Germany , living in a society that tries to seduce him while constantly telling him that he is merely an object of toleration , a person not for himself , but only worth anything as a testimony to Western liberality .
