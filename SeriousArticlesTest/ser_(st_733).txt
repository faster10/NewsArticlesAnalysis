Bradley : I wasn t surprised with Evan s play . I knew he was going to go out there and give it his all for us . I feel like he did an amazing job . I m happy with the way a lot of guys played , even James Young . Not only was ? Curry ? a challenge Draymond Green was too . They have a lot of good players . We gave effort , and that s how it should be every single night no matter who is on the floor . It makes me happy knowing my teammates are always going to have my back defensively , and I m always going to have theirs .
