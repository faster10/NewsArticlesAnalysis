Belichick just outsmarted himself down the stretch of this one . New England trailed 20 12 when it had a fourth and 1 at the Denver 16 with just over six minutes left . Belichick decided to go for it and Brady s pass to Julian Edelman lost one yard . Belichick should have gone for the field goal to cut the deficit to 20 15 , which would have eliminated the need to get a two point conversion . There was plenty of time to hold the Bronco and get the ball back .
