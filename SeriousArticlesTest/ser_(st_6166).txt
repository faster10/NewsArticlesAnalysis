You don ' t need " Small Business Saturday " to succeed . In fact , if you ' re a successful small business owner you could very well be insulted by the idea . I am . You run a profitable business . Your customers buy from you because you simply give them a better product or service than the competition , large or small . You provide that extra level of attention that big companies can ' t deliver . You are involved in your community because it ' s the right thing to do . You pay your taxes . You hire . You fire . You know how to buy something for a dollar and sell it for three . There should be no national day that recognizes your profit taking . This is just what you do and you do it well . There are other people more deserving of the country ' s attention like our military , for example ?
