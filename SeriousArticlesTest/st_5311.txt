Gervais s pub banter and cool guy act manage to tap into the feeling we all have in our hearts when we watch awards shows : it does not matter , it s a waste of our time , and every show is basically the same week old cheese in a shiny gold wrapper . Gervais is the audience surrogate , telling those famous people what we all want to say to them , even if it s cruel , unpleasant , or just not funny . Coming from an English person , the insults almost sound polite . I envy you all for your accents . Even Benny Hill sounded smarter than every American ever . It has to be this way , because it lets everyone off the hook : the network , the producers , the nominees , the presenters , and most of all , the audience . Everything has to be self aware now . Nothing can be genuine , except for maybe the Super Bowl , because Lord knows the NFL does not have a sense of humour about itself .
