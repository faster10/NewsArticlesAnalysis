It ' s a daunting challenge , to be sure , to turn a big musical into a viable movie . For every great Cabaret , My Fair Lady , and The King and I , there ' s a dud Rent , Evita , and Mamma Mia ! But this steam driven military weapon of an enterprise is a sobering reminder of just how tinny a musical Les Mis rables was in the first place the listless music and lyrics by Alain Boubil , Claude Michel Sch nberg , and Herbert Kretzmer , the derivative characters fashioned from Oliver ! scraps . And even if you do come to Mr Hooper ' s neighborhood loving the show , having seen seven stage productions and named your cat Gavroche after the urchin who hitches his fate to those of grown up revolutionaries , well , you ' re in for a gobsmacking : This ' ' prestige ' ' production is at heart a minor road show carnival , leaving behind little but tinsel as it rumbles through the streets of Awardstown . Grade : C
