The way to get better questions is to get better questioners . Mr Priebus and his committee should insist that the networks recruit interrogators from the ranks of those who have a record of asking questions without resort to insult or vanity . These are most likely to be the men and women who cover the news for newspapers and magazines , who travel with the candidates , who work their craft in the realm of ideas and policy , without undue obsession with how they look or how their hair is styled . Donald Trump s hair trumps all , anyway .
