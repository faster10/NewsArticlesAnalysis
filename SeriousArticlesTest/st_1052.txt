filmex Give us a break . You honestly believe that Wade exhibited increasingly erratic behaviour toward female athletes without anyone but Dirk Koetter being aware of it ? From another hatchet piece about Koetter on the same theme , it s obvious that the female athletes teams knew , campus security knew , AND the police received complaints . Koetter was one of the last to hear about the incidents , and kicking the guy off the team certainly wouldn t have prevented his actions . If you post BS , at least try to keep it from being slanderous toward someone .
