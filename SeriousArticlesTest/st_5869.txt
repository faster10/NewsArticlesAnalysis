As previously reported by Inquisitr , the Pittsburgh Steelers are dealing with injuries to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and wide receiver Antonio Brown . While both players are expected to be in the starting lineup next Sunday , they may not be 100 percent healthy . After inserting quarterback Peyton Manning back into the lineup last week , the Broncos appear to be a rejuvenated football team . Also reported by the Inquisitr , Manning may retire after the 2016 NFL playoffs . Injuries to the Steelers combined with the Broncos coming together to win the Super Bowl for Manning are going to make it extremely difficult for Pittsburgh to win in Denver . Look for the Broncos to not only win , but to cover the six and a half point spread .
