Tom Brady dropped back to pass 61 times , and was under duress for 35 of them ? either a hurry , hit , or sack . And most of the damage came in the second half ( really the fourth quarter ) , when the altitude likely affected the Patriots conditioning . Brady was under pressure on 9 of 23 throws in the first half , and 26 of 38 in the second half . Fifteen of the 20 hits came in the second half , and so did 14 of 18 quarterback pressures .
