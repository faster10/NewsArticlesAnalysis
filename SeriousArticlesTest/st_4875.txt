The new Poll of Polls on the Republican side shows Trump moving ahead of Ted Cruz , with the New York businessman averaging 31 across the last four polls compared with Cruz ' s 26 . That ' s a sharp change when compared with last week ' s average , which showed Cruz a hair ahead of Trump , 27 to 25 . The new average wraps in two new polls which were conducted entirely after the January 14 GOP debate . Both of those polls found Trump holding a wide lead over Cruz , while some early January polling which showed Cruz and Trump running about evenly is now too old for inclusion .
