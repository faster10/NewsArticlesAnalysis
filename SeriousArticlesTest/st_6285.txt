It comes down to a poor decision by Taylor , and poor coaching for whoever on the Lions taught him to tackle . With the game on the line , you never go for the head . Taylor ' s teammate already had Rodgers wrapped up below . Why would you even think of having your hands anywhere near someone ' s facemask or head ? It ' s because that ' s how the Lions are taught to play . This is still the team of Suh ' s personal fouls .
