Dance , dance , dance . Pamplona turns into one big 24 hour a day party for the festival of San Ferm n . Everyone ' s dressed in white clothes with red bandanas , and everyone is there to have a good time . There is live music everywhere , so it ' s a great opportunity to groove to the most popular Spanish hits . I remember dancing to Melendi ' s " Caminando por la Vida " around 3 a . m . at one of the outdoor concerts .
