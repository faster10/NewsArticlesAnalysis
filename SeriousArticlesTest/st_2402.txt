" This is exactly what I said a few weeks ago after the stupid US foreign policy advisers OKed kidnapping the wrong guy from Libya , " someone posted on the school Facebook page . " You think his family will just stand still and wait for mercy ? No . They will go around shooting random Americans or kidnapping them for revenge . This administration killed this teacher by their stupid acts . You kidnapped the Libyan guy and you don ' t even have a case against him and you just have him in a jail in NYC waiting for nothing . and you know you cannot bring a case against him because you have no case . . .
