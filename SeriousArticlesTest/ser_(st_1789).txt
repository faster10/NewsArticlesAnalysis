James O ' Keefe , the conservative activist who pulled off stings against ACORN and National Public Radio , didn ' t have to hand his undercover video to a news organization . While he has sometimes favored conservative outlets , O ' Keefe packages the material himself ( and , in the case of ACORN , engaged in misleading editing ) . O ' Keefe told me in 2011 that " reporters do a lot of stenography in this country , " but that " real investigative reporting is showing things for what they are . "
