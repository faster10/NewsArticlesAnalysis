This is one of three sequences that haunt the movie . A second is when Kate sits down at her piano and picks out music for the first time in what may be years . At first she plays the Bach piece that s on the stand , every note perfect and in its place . Then , in a trance , she slides into an improvisation that grows wild and wilder , as if we were getting a glimpse of the adventurous Katya that Kate herself might have been , of the life she might have had if she hadn t given it away . And suddenly the 45 years of the title no longer seems like a blessing . It feels like a curse .
