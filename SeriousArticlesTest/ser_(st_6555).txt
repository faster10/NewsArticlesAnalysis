Dave Matthews : Of course it is ! I found there ' s a fairly blatant racism in America that ' s already there , and I don ' t think I noticed it when I lived here as a kid . But when I went back to South Africa , and then it ' s sort of thrust in your face , and then came back here I just see it everywhere . There ' s a good population of people in this country that are terrified of the president only because he ' s black , even if they don ' t say it . And I think a lot of them , behind closed doors , do say it .
