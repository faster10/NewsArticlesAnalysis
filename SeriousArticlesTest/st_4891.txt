Research compiled by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center ? shows that there s a strong correlation between homicide rates and gun ownership , both on a state and household level . While some cities do have a criminal gang problem that leads to high murder rates in neighborhoods that have a gang problem , there is a lot of gun violence beyond that , much at the hands of those law abiding citizens we hear so much about . In addition , the suicide rate is strongly correlated to the gun ownership rate , because having access to a gun makes someone in the throes of a depressive episode that much more likely to both try and succeed at suicide . Look past the racially tinged stereotypes of responsible rural people and lawless urban people and a much more complex picture emerges .
