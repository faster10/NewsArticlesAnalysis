Many , many , many years ago , when I was training , I remember I would look at young kids my age , in their 20s . They re all trying to get jobs , to build a future . What am I doing ? I m training . Six to eight hours , every day . Going down this road with this big dead end . The best thing I could do was a gold medal . There s no pot of gold at the end . Then I would think , wait a second . Even though I m living on 10 , 000 a year , in a 145 a month apartment , driving a 175 car , in so many ways I m richer than that , because every day I wake up and I am excited about the day . I ve got training to do . I ve got a competition coming up . I can t wait for the day to start . For many years , I lost that in my life . Now for the first time in my life in many , many , many , many years , I actually wake up in the morning excited about the day . Can t wait . I got so many things to do . And I want to make a positive impact on this community and on the world , open up this conversation .
