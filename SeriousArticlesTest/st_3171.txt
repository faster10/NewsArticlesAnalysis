As Ramesh Ponnuru pointed out , Jeb Bush ' s proposed tax plan has cuts and trims that the Tax Foundation believes would raise middle class incomes by nearly three percent . But the effect on high incomes would be nearly quadruple that . And , given the demographic realities of the party , these tax cuts end up helping rich white liberal voters more than downscale conservative families . That ' s why Bush has to promise that his plan will magically create four percent growth in the economy , something he only accomplished in Florida during a major housing bubble .
