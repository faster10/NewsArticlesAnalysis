So what do we do ? Well we can try to revitalize science education in America , which we must do , but it ' s going to be a long slog . We ' ve fallen quite far behind . But we have been this amazing magnet the brightest students in the world come to America because we have the best colleges and universities in the world , and we are also seen as a place in which people find it attractive to study and work . But then , after we train all these hundreds of thousands of students from all over the world , the cream of the crop , we throw them out of the country , we tell them don ' t you dare work here , because that would mean you would invent here , and hire people here , create new companies here , file new patents here , pay taxes here . No , no , no , go back to your country .
