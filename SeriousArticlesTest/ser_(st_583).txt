This time around , the race between the two frontrunners closed to a neck and neck statistical tie . Trump fell back a little bit , and Carson surged forward , to meet in the middle . Part of this was due to the last debate , where Trump wasn ' t as bombastic as usual and Carson held his own . Since the last time we took a look at the race , Trump went down 1 . 4 points , from 26 . 2 percent to 24 . 8 percent . Carson rose 3 . 2 points , from 21 . 2 percent to 24 . 2 percent . That ' s a separation between the two of only 0 . 6 percent , but what ' s more significant is that Carson has been beating Trump in some individual polls ( while Trump beats Carson in others , to be fair ) . Carson ' s average even briefly rose above Trump ' s for a few days , and now they are virtually tied . Trump ' s shown a greater willingness to directly attack Carson , so the next debate should be interesting to watch as the two of them struggle for the lead .
