RS : It depends what parts of the process you consider writing . I d been thinking and free writing and sketching out scenes for weeks . But only one of those scenes I pre wrote actually made it into the final story ( the scene with her judo coach Justin Flores ) . The rest of the story , the first draft anyway , was done between a Friday night and Sunday afternoon . The interview we did was just so powerful and raw , I knew I had to frame the whole story around it . I finished the interview around 1 p . m . on a Friday , walked around Venice Beach for a few hours to collect my thoughts and process it , drove home , grabbed a few things and checked into a hotel near my house where I go sometimes when I m on a tight turn . I have an amazing husband who understands that I need to do that sometimes . I had to fly to Bristol to tape a TV special on the Ideas of the Year issue that week , so my editor , Raina Kelley , spent all day with it on a Monday while I was in the air , and sent me notes by the time I landed . We worked on it together during the day on Tuesday , then I stayed late at the office that night to finish a second draft . On Wednesday Raina and the top editor on the piece , Eric Neel , went through it closely and did line edits . We closed the story on Thursday . I tend to talk about my story a lot with a lot of people . It helps me to work through everything , but you also get a lot of insights and ideas from people that you wouldn t have thought of yourself . One of the people I really enjoyed talking with during the story was her sister , Maria Burns Ortiz , who wrote her book with her . She obviously knows her better than I do and she really helped me understand the dynamic between Ronda and her mom .
