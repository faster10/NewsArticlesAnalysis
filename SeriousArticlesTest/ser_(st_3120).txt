Recorded with a murderer s row of jazz musicians in early 2015 , Blackstar was released Friday , on Bowie s birthday , two days before the news Sunday night of his death from cancer . The illness was kept secret until its course was run . This was in perfect line with the pristine , mostly unsentimental and entirely British control Bowie always exerted over his projections into the world . Not for Bowie the kind of farewell concert or media tour that Americans such as Warren Zevon or , more recently , Glen Campbell have taken when facing terminal illness .
