Panthers will win today , they are a team of destiny this year . Just look at the match ups and if you re not a Cam hater or a Cardinal fan it s easy to see . The Panthers front seven will get to Palmer all day and by the second half he s going to be well rattled . Cam will probably run for 50 yards , Panthers will run for 150 as a team . With no honey badger back there the Panthers offense ( 1 scoring ) will score 30 and hold the Cards to 20ish . Then on to a revenge game against the Pats in the Super Bowl . Go Panthers , Keep Pounding !
