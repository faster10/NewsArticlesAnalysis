When my parents bought their first mobile phones about 10 years ago , I didn ' t think they ' d ever get the hang of using them . Mom would answer my call from the front of the line at Starbucks and say , " Hello darling , yes I ' ll take the tall thanks , what is it , James do you have any cash ? " all in one breath . My favorite were the random , cryptic one word text messages like " I " or " soon " or " shirtt . "
