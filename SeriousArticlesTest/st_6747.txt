Wage growth : It ' s up 2 . 3 over the past year , a tick down from last month ' s 2 . 5 pace , but it ' s fair to say at this point that nominal wage growth has picked up a bit , as we ' d expect given the tightening job market . That ' s a good thing no cause for alarm ! We want faster wage growth , and there ' s certainly little evidence it ' s bleeding into prices , which remain stagnant . Weekly hours ticked down slightly , so weekly earnings fell a bit in November and are up 2 over the past year .
