The consequences for the people of Flint , though , are but one especially horrible example of what is happening to minority and low income communities everywhere and every day . Pick any type of pollution then look to see who is the most exposed and the most harmed . Take lead , for instance . Although lead exposure had declined overall , African American children are five times more likely to be poisoned than white children . Why ? In part because the neighborhoods where they live are more likely to have been exposed to lead when cars still used leaded gas . Decades later , children are still paying a price .
