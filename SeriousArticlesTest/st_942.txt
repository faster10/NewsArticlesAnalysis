The world is most concerned about the number of dead and refugees because their suffering is more evident . From my own experience I can say that those unjustly arrested men and women are suffering immensely , probably much more than refugees . In addition to torture , humiliation and degrading treatment , they are forbidden from seeing their families or having any form of communication with them . And for those families outside , the wait cannot be more excruciating . I spent most of the last few months fighting the sense of helplessness and incapability . Can you imagine knowing your loved one is going through so much pain and suffering and you cannot do anything about it ?
