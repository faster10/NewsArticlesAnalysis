None of this is to suggest that Jeb Bush doesn ' t have appeal as a candidate I like some of the things he did as Florida governor , like his record of cutting 19 billion in taxes and supporting school choice programs . ( Although I ' m not a fan of his willingness to grant illegal immigrants amnesty in any shape , fashion or form . ) He seems more equipped to lead America and get things done than some others in the already cramped horse race like New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , who seems more concerned with telling people off than sounding presidential .
