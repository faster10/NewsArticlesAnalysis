Jackson , the Bengals offensive coordinator , saw his season come to a crushing end Saturday night with a last second 18 16 loss to the Steelers . The very next day , Jackson interviewed with the Browns and 49ers ? and there were reports a deal with the 49ers was imminent . That does not appear to be the case , and the Giants have requested permission from the Bengals to speak with Jackson . If it happens , it would be the seventh interview conducted by co owner John Mara and general manager Jerry Reese .
