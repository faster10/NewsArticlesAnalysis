Yes , as so many journalists seem obligated to point out , kids are criticizing corporate America while tweeting through their iPhones . The simplistic critique is that if someone is upset about corporate excess , he is supposed to abandon all connection with any corporate product .

There are other things big corporations may not do so well , like structure mortgage derivatives . Might we be able to use corporations for what works , and get them out of doing what doesn ' t ?
