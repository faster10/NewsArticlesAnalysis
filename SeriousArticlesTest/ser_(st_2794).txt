' I thought he was outstanding , ' said Brendan Rodgers . ' Simon wasn ' t overly worked but he made two great saves when called upon . But what was really pleasing was how dominant he was . Benteke is nearly unstoppable in the air when he is challenging for the ball . But Simon came for a number of crosses and got contact with the ball and was really calm and composed and wasn ' t flustered . The team as a whole defended very , very well but I was particularly pleased for him as he has had a wee bit of stick . I thought he was excellent . '
