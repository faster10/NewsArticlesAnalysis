You know what the really ironic thing about Dallas being ( likely ) unable to stop the Panthers ? They ' re modeled fairly similarly after the 2014 Cowboys . Strong offensive line albeit with not as strong a pedigree an impressive running game featuring an underrated top tier running back who has both power and burst and a passing game that takes shots down the field . There ' s no Dez Bryant , but Greg Olsen qualifies as a sure handed " No . 1 receiver " and a matchup nightmare . Devin Funchess is starting to come on strong as of late , which would be a tremendous boost to Carolina ' s offense .
