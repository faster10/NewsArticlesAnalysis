Genetic testing for Zika virus is the only way to know if a mother has caught the infection , but with less than one in five people developing symptoms , diagnosis is often missed . Also , unlike Ebola and Hepatitis C that are present in the blood for months after infection , Zika stays in the blood for just a week , which means infected people test positive only if tested in the week long window when the person is still ill . The upside is that once the virus clears the body , it becomes safe for women to get pregnant , but for women living in countries with local transmission , re infection is possible .
