Rubio , as usual , performed well . But his approach ? shaping canned excerpts to questions and using replies to give condensed parts from his stump speech ? has diminishing returns . For as much as it might impress new viewers , it s a reminder that Rubio has nothing new to say . Sen . Ted Cruz as well tailored his stump speech to the questions at hand , but there were times when he went off script to mediate a fight ? trying to stake a middle ground between Rubio and Paul , for instance ? or make a sharp point . On immigration , for example , Cruz sowed the ground for an eventual attack on Rubio and Jeb Bush , who back reform in one way or another . For those of us who believe people ought to come to this country legally and we should enforce the law , we re tired of being told it is anti immigrant , said Cruz . Every sovereign nation secures its borders , and it is not compassionate to say we re not going to enforce the laws and we re going to drive down the wages for millions of hard working men and women . No one on stage took a direct a swing at Rubio on immigration , but from that answer it s clear Cruz is practicing .
