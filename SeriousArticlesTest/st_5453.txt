" The first time I went out to camp , I didn ' t know what to expect , and actually I was very busy at the time , and I was on my phone , and one of the children started speaking about their experience at camp , and I hung up my phone , and I settled in , and I started listening , and I just started crying . This child was sharing how impactful camp was to him . And then the parents were sitting there too , saying ' it meant so much to us to see our child be so affected by this . ' I was completely hooked . And our whole team with Travelers tournament , we feel so fortunate to be able to give them the money because of what they do and what it means to kids and what it means to the parents to see the transformation in those kids .
