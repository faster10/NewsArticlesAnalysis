As our colleague ? Alex Moe observed , last night s debate was a reminder of what the GOP race MIGHT have looked like if Trump hadn t run for president . Strikingly , Jeb Bush had his strongest debate of the cycle ( just compare and contrast his showdown with Rubio on immigration last night vs . the showdown over Rubio s Senate voting record in October s CNBC debate ) . Rand Paul wasn t far behind . In fact , we have to agree with the take that Trump s candidacy hurt these two men more than any others in the GOP field . We already mentioned Cruz rough night . But Rubio also has his struggles . Yes , he stood out ? in a good way ? during the first half of the debate . Yet when the conversation turned to immigration , especially the video montage , Rubio had to play defense on what has been his biggest vulnerability in this race . So the good news for Cruz was that , despite his own struggles , Rubio also got pounded from the right and left ( from Jeb ) on immigration .
