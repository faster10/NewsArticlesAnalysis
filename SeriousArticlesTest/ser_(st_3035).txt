Which is more outlandish ? The 24 foot high arched sign over the entrance of the Tinley Park Park District dog park or the 24 , 000 it cost taxpayers ? The administrators of this village just can ' t spend enough of our money quickly enough . It ' s surprising they did not think it required a golden arch . The park district director ' s pitiful explanation is that the arch needed to be at least 16 feet high to allow for fire truck access . A sign beside the entrance instead of over it would have allowed sky high access , cost at least 20 , 000 less and been perfectly suitable .
