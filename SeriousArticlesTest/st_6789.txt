JAMIE : I ( already ) get , " Oh my God , you ' re Christian Grey ! " ( out in public ) . And I say , " No , I ' m Jamie ! I ' m an actor . " When the film comes out , there will probably be more of that . I don ' t think you can prepare for that . You can ' t put up sandbags , get rations in . I just live my life . I ' ve had the same friends since I was a small boy . None of them do what I do or , frankly , give a sh t about what I do . We just love each other . The one thing I take comfort in is that none of that is going anywhere , no matter what the perception of me is or what happens in my career .
