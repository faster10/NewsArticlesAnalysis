Ohhh , that is something . I got to the point where every day I was living authentically , but what does all this mean ? What does this thing that you have had in your head for so many years , mean ? It s more than makeup and clothes and all that other stuff . And what is that ? I m working on that . There s still a lot to learn about being a woman . Honestly , I started getting books , started reading on all that kind of stuff . Have I come up with an answer ? Not even close .
