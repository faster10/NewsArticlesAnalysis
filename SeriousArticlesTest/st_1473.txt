This isn t all just bluster . Total day to day Whitehall spending is ? 22 . 9bn higher ? than the OBR s projections in July . And spending falls by an average of 1 . 1 per cent a year , less severe than the 1 . 6 per a year average in the last Parliament . However , the reversal shouldn t be exaggerated . Total public expenditure will still fall to just 36 . 5 per cent of GDP in 2019 20 . Only twice since the Second World War has it been so low . ?
