He s played well here the last couple of years , Murray said . He s always dangerous because he goes for it . He doesn t really hold back . Sometimes he can make a bunch of errors and then in the space of a couple of games can completely change and start hitting winners from all over the court . He s a tough guy to play against for that reason . He has a lot of power and he can almost take ? the racket out of your hand at times .
