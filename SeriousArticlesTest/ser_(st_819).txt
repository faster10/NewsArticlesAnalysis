Peyton Manning is fiercely competitive , and the odds are that he will not retire without a fight . The problem for Manning is that his play may force him into retirement if he does not want to accept a backup role . While Broncos backup quarterback Brock Osweiler is not exactly the NFL s next star quarterback , he may be a better option than Manning going into next season and beyond . At only 25 years old , Osweiler still has plenty of room to grow with the Broncos and could turn out to be a serviceable option for the next decade .
