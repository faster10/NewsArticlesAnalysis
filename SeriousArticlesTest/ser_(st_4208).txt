Chris did a good job for us last night , " Brady said . " Just stepping in and a lot of things he didn t practice and when you watch the things he was doing you re really encouraged . It will be good to get a good week of practice with all the guys who go out there and play and then you try and cut it loose and see if what you re doing is good enough for that particular week and it some point you have to try and get some guys back healthy and playing back in their normal positions . If you can do that and withstand the injuries , you have a deeper team and guys have more experience . We re just at a place right now where we ve lost a lot of players , but at the same time , like I said , our expectations don t change . It doesn t let you off the hook for things we re perfectly capable of doing and executing , which we are , and we just didn t do many of those things well last night . "
