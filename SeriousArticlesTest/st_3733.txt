There are other ways in which Coachella s latest lineup feels a bit routine , from the high number of repeat visitors including Ellie Goulding , Disclosure , Zedd and Calvin Harris , all of whom played in 2014 to the presence of James Bay and Of Monsters and Men , who will uphold the festival s troubling commitment to dreary , vaguely folky alternative rock . ( Hopefully , ? neither of them attempts to cover Morris Day and the Time s Jungle Love as Hozier rather embarrassingly did last year . )
