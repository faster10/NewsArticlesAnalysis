Are you ready to make America great again ? We all have a part in this . We all have a responsibility . Looking around at all of you , you hard working Iowa families . You farm families , and teachers , and teamsters , and cops , and cooks . You rockin rollers . And holy rollers ! All of you who work so hard . You full time moms . You with the hands that rock the cradle . You all make the world go round , and now our cause is one .
