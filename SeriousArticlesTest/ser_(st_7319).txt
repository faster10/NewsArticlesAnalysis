Larson gives a powerful performance , which has earned her a Golden Globe , with more prizes potentially on the way . She is very good at conveying the nauseous wretchedness of her life : the strain of concealing the truth from her son , or rather the strain of behaving as if the truth does not exist , since it would be impossible to explain . She preserves the macabre parody of his innocence in this satanic Eden , with no one else there except for an adult of whose love he is confident , and ( periodically ) another whose essential goodness as a provider he has no reason to doubt .
