Keep in mind that Stutzman does not refuse service to gay people . Indeed she had been selling flowers to this gay couple for nine years . She has also employed gay people in her flower shop . She had a friendship with the man suing her and cared for him personally and wished for her relationship with him to continue . She simply could not defy her conscience and lend her creative talent to help celebrate what her faith says she cannot celebrate . She had no idea that staying true to her faith would end up threatening her entire livelihood and savings .
