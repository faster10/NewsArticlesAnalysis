It was December and these guys were shivering . I gave them kahwa to warm them up and told my chief secretary and Mr ( AS ) Dulat ( then IB chief in Srinagar ) to brief them . I must say , to the credit of Arif , he told Mr Gujral , I m very sorry , this is not what we have been told in the Cabinet . What we had been told was very different . He suggested that they fly back to Delhi to brief the PM and tell him to use diplomatic pressure to get the girl released . Mr Gujral said no , no , we have got the authority and if he ( Farooq Abdullah ) does not release the militants then we are going to dismiss him .
