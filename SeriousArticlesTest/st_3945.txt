Sarah Palin s endorsement of Donald Trump on Tuesday was a mighty thing to behold . ? Palin is almost delightfully unencumbered by old fashioned notions about rhetoric , such as the long standing belief that ideas should flow together into a larger argument . She s more like a magic 8 ball of wingnuttery , spewing out random right wing truisms at random . Shake The media is out to get you ! Shake Imply that the only real Americans are conservative white people . Shake Hilariously inauthentic countryisms about strength and determination !
