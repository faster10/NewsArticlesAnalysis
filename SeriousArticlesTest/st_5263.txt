" Alan Arkin ' s performance in ' Little Miss Sunshine ' is Oscar worthy , it ' s a great performance . That ' s just the way the s went . He ' s been gigging for years and years , the guy ' s in his seventies . I totally understood and was totally cool . I wasn ' t like , ' What the f ? ' Afterward , people were like , ' He ' s upset , ' and I ' m like , ' I wasn ' t upset ! ' What happened was after I lost , I ' m just chilling , and I was sitting next to Beyonc ' s pops , and he leans over and grabs me and is like , solemn voice ' There will be other times . ' And then you feel Spielberg on your shoulder going , ' It ' s all right , man . ' Then Clint Eastwood walks by : ' Hey , guy . . . ' So I was like , ' It ' s not going to be this night ! ' Mimes getting up I didn ' t have sour grapes at all . That ' s another reason I wanted to host the show to show them that I ' m down with it . "
