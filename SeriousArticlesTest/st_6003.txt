About a half hour s drive from Jerusalem , I visit a plant that makes air conditioning parts . Moshe Lev Ran , the international manager , who bears a slight resemblance to actor Lorne Greene of the old Bonanza TV series , employs Jews and Muslims who he says work together without any problems . Mr Lev Ran , who says he believes in equal pay for all , thinks prosperity is the key to peace in the region . He admits to a left hand ( liberal ) worldview and given the periodic outbursts of violence by some who are better off than they were before the occupation , he is likely engaging in wishful thinking that money is the key to peace .
