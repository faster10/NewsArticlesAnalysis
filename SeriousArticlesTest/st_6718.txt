It was , finally , the moment Democrats have been waiting for : Former Secretary Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders facing off one on one , unencumbered by extraneous candidates and audience questions . Last night s MSNBC debate crackled with heat , as the two candidates stood very close to each other on stage and made their case to the watching public , answering questions from moderators Rachel Maddow and Chuck Todd . It led to both candidates becoming their most provocative ? Clinton was forceful and dismissive , while Sanders was stern and evasive . The first hour exacerbated the tension between them , as both candidates seemed to entrench in their worldviews , no matter how unpopular . The two bickered over the definition of the word progressive ? it comes from the word progress , did you know ? ? and of who , exactly , is part of the establishment . As I observed yesterday , during the CNN Democratic Town Hall , both Sanders and Clinton were attempting to finesse compromises ( or the semblance thereof ) between polar opposites , the rhetorical equivalent of walking the plank . But debates are about differentiation , and primaries are about being choosy , so here we stood , watching mom and dad argue after dinner as if the whole state of the free world depended on it .
