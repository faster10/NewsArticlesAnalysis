That said there are those that want to keep saying that ISIS utilizes the Qur ' an for inspiration to do bad things . Look for every verse you can misinterpret ( and yeah you are misinterpreting them ! ) in the Qur ' an I can find the same thing in the Bible and the Torah some even worse sounding . Stop with the hypocrisy . If someone is hellbent on being evil they can draw inspiration from a turnip . The reality is , the Holy Qur ' an is the Word of God for Muslims worldwide . It is a manual on how to live our lives . It teaches us to submit to the will of God and trust in Him . To relinquish our egos . To pray not because God needs our prayers because WE need to submit ourselves to give our tired souls a break from thinking we have all the answers . We don ' t . We are mere pieces of dust . Qur ' an teaches us that charity is the most important thing we can do as human beings . It teaches us to fear the prayers of the oppressed .
