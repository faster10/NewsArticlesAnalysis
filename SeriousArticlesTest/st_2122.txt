Morgenstern : I don ' t think it will become a series , a direct sequel or anything like that , but there ' s a lot more material floating around the edges . There are lots of little tangential stories that could become part of a prequel , or collected short stories . I think that would probably be the extent of it but it would be fun to play with . There ' s a lot more material on all the side characters that didn ' t make it into the finished book .
