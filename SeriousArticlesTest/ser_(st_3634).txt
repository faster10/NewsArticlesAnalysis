A continuous shower of debris rained on my head , shoulders , and back . I couldn ' t tell when it would end because I couldn ' t even see my hands . Feeling around my surroundings with my fingers , I determined I wasn ' t trapped . Within minutes , a triage tag was forced around my neck and I was taken by ambulance to the hospital . Doctors in the ER cut off my clothes and stuck a tube down my throat to see if my lungs were burned . They weren ' t . I was mostly fine . One of the lucky ones .
