" I ' m just very disappointed in not giving our team a chance to win today , " said Romo , who was 11 of 21 with 106 yards and a 27 . 2 passer rating . " They depend on me to go out there and perform at a certain level , and when I let them down , let our team down , our coaches , our fan base , everybody . That ' s what I did today , and I have to live with that . "
