" To date , there has been no communication from any facility named by you regarding a transfer or requirements for transfer with any of the medical professionals at Children ' s . The family has not identified any facility with which Children ' s can have this dialogue . Nor have we been provided with a transportation plan or coroner authorization , " he wrote . " As your email and your statements about the facility in the Los Angeles area acknowledge , discussion about performing medical procedures upon a dead body presents unusual and complicated questions . Until there is a definite commitment by a facility to accept Jahi ' s body upon specified terms , I don ' t think I can tackle those issues . Please let me know if the family is able to identify a facility . "
