Johnson is going to be a popular pick next season , and rightfully so given the way he played once Chris Johnson went down with a broken leg in Week 12 . He was spectacular , including the playoff loss against the Panthers when he had 15 carries for 60 yards and a touchdown and nine catches for 68 yards . For the season , that was David Johnson ' s ninth game with double digits in Fantasy points in a standard league , which is impressive since he didn ' t get double digits in carries until Week 13 . He averaged 4 . 6 yards per carry and 12 . 7 yards per catch and scored 13 total touchdowns , including the playoffs . Chris Johnson is a free agent and likely won ' t be back with the Cardinals , and Andre Ellington is just a change of pace running back . David Johnson has the goods to be a standout Fantasy option , and he proved that in his final five games of the regular season when he averaged 18 . 2 Fantasy points in a standard league . I have Johnson ranked as a Top 5 running back coming into the season behind only Le ' Veon Bell , Todd Gurley and Adrian Peterson . That might be too aggressive given the small sample size of him as a starter , but I love the Cardinals offense and what he showed when given a chance . Johnson is worth drafting toward the end of Round 1 or beginning of Round 2 in all formats .
