I saw Kobe score 45 points on 20 of 26 shooting . I saw him shoot 12 for 18 from behind the three point line . I saw him put the Lakers so far up that he could leave the game for good in the third quarter after he had scored 62 points ? one more than all the Dallas Mavericks combined . And on Jan . 22 , 2006 , I saw Kobe score 81 points in a single game . I ' ve watched that game at least five times . What ' s it worth to see a man elegantly do the impossible ?
