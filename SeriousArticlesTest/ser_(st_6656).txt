Gupta : Basically , everything in your body , all your senses are activating at the same time . If there is some sort of mismatch between your senses , say your eyes are telling you that you ' re moving or not and your ears are telling you the opposite and for some reason they ' re not connecting , you start to get what ' s called disequilibrium , or motion sickness . And it ' s the body ' s response of telling you " something is not quite right here . "
