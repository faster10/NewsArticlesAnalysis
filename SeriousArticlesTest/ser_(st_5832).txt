Our N . F . L . Playoff Simulator is built for one purpose : to help you explore the paths to the playoffs for every team in the N . F . L . It works like this : We let you choose the outcomes of any game you select and simulate every other game remaining in the 2015 season . ( Last year , we considered each game a coin flip this year we re using Sagarin ratings , which reflect the fact that , even though anything can happen on a given Sunday , not all teams are created equal . )
