Maclin , of course , has been the huge addition to an offense that gained so much notoriety in recent seasons for not being able to get a WR into the end zone . After coming over from Philadelphia in the offseason , Maclin set a career high mark with 89 receptions for Kansas City , and he also found the end zone eight times this season . Ware has been a big part of the backfield in replacing the injured Jamaal Charles , averaging 5 . 6 yards per carry on his way to rushing for six touchdowns . Kelce backed up his stellar 2014 campaign with similar numbers this year ( 72 catches , 875 yards , 5 TDs ) .
