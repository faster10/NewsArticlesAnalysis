Asked by Melich during the interview why she hadn ' t notified authorities for the 31 days Caylee had been missing , Anthony said , " I think part of me was naive enough to think that I could handle this myself , which obviously I couldn ' t . And I was scared that something would happen to her if I did notify the authorities or got the media involved , or my parents , which I know would have done the same thing . Just the fear of the unknown . Fear of the potential of Caylee getting hurt , of not seeing my daughter again . "
