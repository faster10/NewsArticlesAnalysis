Technology makes it a bit easier . The El Paso Zoo sponsored a new app called Palm Oil Guide Scanner , and available for free on Android and Apple iOS that lets consumers scan product bar codes to determine if a particular candy contains palm oil . The app , like the zoo , says consumers should not buy products that contain the oil , whether it is certified as sustainable or not . The sustainability label is not enough to ensure orangutan habitat is not being harmed , according to Marshall .
