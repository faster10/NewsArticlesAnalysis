And this California kidnapping victim isn ' t a typical American 15 year old ( like my daughter ) with a smart phone , a U . S . education , a large family network and an army of teenage friends . She was a 15 year old from Mexico , who had been living in America for just six months when she was allegedly kidnapped . She didn ' t speak English . She didn ' t attend school . She was undocumented and of course feared deportation . With no network of friends or extended family , no education , no roots and no papers , she was allegedly completely under her captor ' s control .
