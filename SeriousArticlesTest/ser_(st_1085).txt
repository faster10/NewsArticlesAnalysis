The good news for Christie is that , per the Morning Joe panel s expert analysis , being kicked off isn t a bad thing ? as a matter of fact , it s a good thing ! And it might even be the start of the frequently predicted , but never realized , Christie Comeback . I don t think it s going to hurt him as much as some people do , said the always correct Mark Halperin . He does have a fundraising problem and he needs to keep that together , but I think right now this is not something that s going to stop Chris Christie s presidential campaign . I think he may be able to turn it to his advantage .
