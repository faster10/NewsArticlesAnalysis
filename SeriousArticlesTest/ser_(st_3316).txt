Walker took office in 2011 facing a 3 . 6 billion budget hole . He had few options at his disposal to balance the budget : raise taxes , make draconian cuts or go after the sweetheart public employee pension and health care plans . He bravely chose the latter , requiring public employees to pay 5 of their salaries toward their pensions ( they paid virtually nothing before ) and 12 . 6 of their health care premiums ( less than what private and federal employees pay ) . Furthermore , he ended collective bargaining except for wages and made automatic union dues optional .
