What Gruber didn ' t say is that Elmendorf ' s CBO , in essence , relied on Gruber ' s own model to do its scoring . The first page of CBO ' s technical description of its health insurance model thanks Gruber , and the document cites him many times . And Gruber actually sat on the CBO ' s panel of health advisers during at least some of the health care debate . ( He says he doesn ' t remember if it overlapped with his time as a paid adviser to the Obama administration . )
