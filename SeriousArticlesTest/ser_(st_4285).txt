Last year , Dr Kiran Sagar , a cardiologist in Wisconsin , was fired two months after presenting strong data showing that cardiologists in the hospital she worked at misread a substantial number of heart tests . Similarly , a nurse from Columbia Hospital Corp . of America ( HCA ) was let go after complaining that a doctor was performing unnecessary cardiac procedures , even after an internal investigation found the nurse ' s claim to be substantiated . And a few weeks ago , the CBS News program " 60 Minutes " reported on ER doctors fired for not meeting quotas on the percentage of patients they admitted to the hospital .
