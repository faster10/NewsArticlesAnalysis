Fitzgerald ' s story is a pregnant philosophical conceit , like a peculiarly refined " Twilight Zone " episode , set among Baltimore ' s 19th century gentry . Roth expands it into a rich Louisiana picaresque , ranging far and wide as Benjamin tastes romance in Russia with the wife of an English diplomat ( a beguiling Tilda Swinton ) , comes off second best in an encounter with a German U boat , and pursues Daisy , the love of his life , first to New York and then to Paris .
