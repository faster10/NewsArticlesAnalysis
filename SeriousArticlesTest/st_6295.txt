Paul double doubled with 13 points , 11 assists , five boards , two steals , one 3 pointer and three turnovers , and it s safe to say that his groin issue is a thing of the past . The Clippers have limited him to an average of 31 . 3 minutes over his last three , so expect that number to rise in the coming week . J . J . Redick scored 17 points with three treys , while Jamal Crawford scored just eight points on 1 of 8 shooting from the field .
