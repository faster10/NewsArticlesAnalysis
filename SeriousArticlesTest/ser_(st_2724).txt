Eddie Lacy is on a roll : In his last two games , the Packers running back has finally started to look like the same guy who rushed for 1 , 100 yards in each of his first two seasons . Lacy rushed for 100 yards on 22 carries against the Vikings and 105 yards on 17 carries in the Thanksgiving loss to the Bears . That said , the Packers have to commit to the run . Lacy s 39 carries are the most he s had in consecutive games this season , and it likely would ve been higher had he not fumbled against the Bears .
