If I were on the bench , I d think it d be over the top . I would ve been proud of Matt that he wanted to stay in the game but there s a decorum on the bench . The manager tells the pitching coach , the pitching coach tells the pitcher that his night is done . You can bitch and moan to the pitching coach about it , but you don t take it to the manager because the manager has bigger things to do than one of 25 guys .
