Take action to make it more difficult for companies to perform these tax inversions . Clinton wants to ensure that if companies want to give up their US identity , then at least half the shares in any merged entity must be held by the foreign company s shareholders . In the past , the US company has typically been much bigger than the overseas company with which it was merging . The law currently states that the overseas company has to have a stake of at least a fifth in the combined entity . The Obama administration has moved to increase the threshold to 40 per cent . In the Pfizer deal , Allergan shareholders will hold some 44 45 per cent of the merged company ( one of the limiting factors for Pfizer in choosing a target was finding a company that was big enough to have a holding of more than 40 per cent post merger ) ? but under the Clinton plan this would not be enough .
