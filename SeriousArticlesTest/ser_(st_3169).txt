Wednesday night ' s debate ? which was specifically cast by CNBC as being about the economy ? only added to the evidence that GOP offerings on this topic are wholly insufficient . There ' s the banal , like raising the age for eligibility for Medicare and Social Security , which Rand Paul mentioned . Sometimes it is crankish , like Ted Cruz ' s demand for ' sound money . ' Or just gimmicky , like Carly Fiorina ' s three page tax code . Republicans are just trying to fiddle with the few dials they have left , and no one is satisfied . This is a party that simply does not know how to address the economic issues that the vast majority of non rich Americans care about .
