Back when Jobs returned to Apple and came out with the iMac , many users were aghast at being asked to purchase a computer with no floppy drive ! Sure , Steve saw the writing on the wall ( or felt confident enough to scribble it up there himself ) , and decided for us that floppy drives were obsolete . If you can burn CDs , why mess with floppies ? Besides , Internet speeds were starting to increase and it was just a matter of time before people exchanged files by e mail instead of handing and mailing physical disks to one another .
