The happy couples I talked to had not met and immediately started dating . Instead , they connected in more natural and yes , ambiguous settings . They played on the same volleyball team or were co workers on a political campaign . Or they hung out in the same social group or were friends for years before getting intimately involved or got intimately involved right off the bat with no initial relationship plans . Or they met each other while living in different parts of the country and got to know each other via Facebook or Gchat before committing to full on romances .
