JOHANNESBURG Pope Paul VI became the first modern pope to visit Africa in 1969 and declared the continent a " new homeland " for Jesus Christ . During the quarter century of his papacy , St . John Paul II traveled to 42 African countries and earned the nickname " the African . " Pope Benedict XVI said Africa was a continent of hope . This week , Pope Francis joins his predecessors and visits a region whose growing numbers of Catholics are seen as a bulwark for a church seeking to broaden its appeal in the face of challenges from secularism , competing Christian faiths , and violent extremism .
