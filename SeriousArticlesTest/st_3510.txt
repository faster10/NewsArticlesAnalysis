I ' m always kind of like in the middle . I ' m not a guy who likes to sit . If we take care of business and we go out and we ' re able to beat up on a team and I can sit in the fourth , then I can . If not , then I need to play . If I ' m in the lineup then I need to be out on the floor . And I ' m not saying I have to be out there 48 minutes or 40 minutes . But I ' m going to make an impact .
