I called Marguerite Wolffsohn , a naturalist whom I ' ve known since we were just kids fresh out of college doing temporary nature center gigs and looking for jobs . She found a job with the East Hampton ' s town planning department . ( East Hampton canceled its intended participation in the deer kill this year because it had insufficient time for procedural requirements . ) Better than anyone I know , Marguerite works thoughtfully within the totality of the East End deer proposal , the deer controversy , deer lovers and detesters , and lest they get left out the deer themselves .
