I did a lot of walking in what was a mini heatwave and found that address after address just wasn t there . I then questioned some of those close to the project and the alarmed looks all but signed off the story for me . I also began to wonder about the name Nat Tate . How conveniently similar it was to one , if not two , famous London art galleries . It was all a brilliant ruse , more than helped by expert endorsements . Picasso s biographer , John Richardson , was clearly one of the very few in on the secret , as was Gore Vidal , who described the book on the jacket as a moving account of an artist too well understood by his time .
