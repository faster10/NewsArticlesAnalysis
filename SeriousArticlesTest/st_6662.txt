Gupta : Being someone who answers that not only as a doctor but a patient , there really isn ' t . Motion sickness is something that people if you ' re particularly bothered by it might resort to a Dramamine patch , or something like that to get rid of the symptoms , but to have it not actually occur in the first place is a pretty difficult thing to do , particularly through training . The Blue Angels , coincidentally , told me the best therapy for me , was to just throw up . Throw up as quickly as possible . And they were absolutely right , because I tried not to , for the first 30 minutes of the ride , and I was miserable . I kept turning the fans on because I was starting to get that cold sweat , and then I threw up and I felt a thousand times better .
