The number of dead and injured announced , is really , really far from reality . The very bad construction of the country , the lack of organization in general , the fact that the first response help got on the ground days after , will make the final numbers very high , higher than the official numbers given . Fortunately with the fact the earthquake happened at 4 : 53pm , the players of Divisions 1 and 2 were unharmed . The players lost immediate families : parents , wives , children . A lot of young players are orphans . When communication is fully restored and obviously when teams start training again , we will have an idea but the numbers will never be exact .
