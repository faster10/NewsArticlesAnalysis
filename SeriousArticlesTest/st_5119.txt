Also , one great thing about a Sanders presidency is that Americans will be able to trust a person who never had to evolve towards progressive stances on war , foreign policy , Wall Street , and environmental issues like Keystone XL .

Naturally , Clinton supporters aren ' t concerned with perpetual wars .
