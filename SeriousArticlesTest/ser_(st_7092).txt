Washington , D . C . There ' s nothing wrong with enjoying some of the United States ' more well known monuments to its history . A trip to Washington could include a visit to the Washington Monument , the Jefferson Memorial , the Lincoln Memorial and the National Archives . The National Archives Building Rotunda displays the Declaration of Independence , the U . S . Constitution and the Bill of Rights . ( If this history lesson bores the children , promise them a visit to the International Spy Museum later . )
