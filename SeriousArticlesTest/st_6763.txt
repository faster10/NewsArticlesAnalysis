This election is more than just your basic ABCs , anybody but Clinton . It s more than that this go around . When we re talking about a nation without borders . When we re talking about bankruptcies in our federal government . Debt that our children and our grandchildren , they ll never be able to pay off . When we re talking about no more Reaganesque power that comes from strength . Power through strength . Well , then , we re talking about our very existence , so no , we re not gonna chill . In fact it s time to drill , baby , drill down , and hold these folks accountable . And we need to stop the self sabotage and elect new , and independent , a candidate who represents that and represents America first , finally . Pro Constitution , common sense solutions , that he brings to the table . Yes the status quo has got to go . Otherwise we re just going to get more of the same , and with their failed agenda , it can t be salvaged . It must be savaged . And Donald Trump is the right one to do that .
