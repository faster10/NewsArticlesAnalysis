It is with tremendous difficulty and deep sadness that the Timberwolves acknowledge the passing of our President of Basketball Operations and Head Coach , Flip Saunders . Flip was a symbol of strength , compassion , and dignity for our organization . He was a shining example of what a true leader should be , defined by his integrity and kindness to all he encountered . Today is not a day to reflect on Flip s accomplishments in basketball or what he brought to us as an organization on the court , but rather to indicate what he meant to us as a co worker , friend , member of the community and the basketball world at large . We as an organization are devastated by his passing , and our hearts and prayers go out to Debbie and the entire Saunders family as they endure this extraordinary loss .
