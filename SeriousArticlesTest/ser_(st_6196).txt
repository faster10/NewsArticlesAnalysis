Why do we always defer when we win a coin toss ? Shouldn t we put our offense on the field and try and score first ? Musgrave s offense is as predictable as ever and our defense is garbage . Way too much man coverage for the lack of talent by our CB s ( mostly Hayden ) . Amerson , Mack , and Woody played well . But the rest were awful . Oh and Cooper needs to hang on to the damn ball . Good game by Lions
