This would mean that all of the states who believe that we need voter ID laws to protect against a " crisis " of voter fraud would actually need to demonstrate that such a crisis existed . Predictably , when an investigation into voter fraud was launched in Wisconsin in conjunction with proposed voter ID legislation , barely a case was found when someone had voted in place of someone else . Other studies have found the same thing . Voter ID laws to counter voter fraud represent little more than a cure in search of a disease , and states must be stopped from implementing these discriminatory measures .
