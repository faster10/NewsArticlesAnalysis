Sanders big weakness , on the other hand , continues to be foreign policy . It s still thoroughly obvious that he has difficulty moving beyond vague talking points , and he still hasn t figured out how to needle Clinton on her own foreign policy weaknesses . When asked how he d handle the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan , Sanders said he doesn t want to get U . S . troops stuck within the quagmire of Syria and Iraq . When asked again what he d do about Afghanistan , he said we can t simply withdraw tomorrow , and then immediately shifted to Iraq again . Clinton seized the opportunity to pile on Sanders and make the case , both explicitly and by virtue of comparison , that he s ill prepared for the job of commander in chief .
