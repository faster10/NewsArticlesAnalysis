Two films made their debuts in limited release this weekend both to strong , if somewhat unremarkable , results . The Weinstein Co . ' s Silver Linings Playbook , which has tried to present itself as both a romantic comedy and an Oscar hopeful , earned 458 , 000 from 16 theaters , giving it a 28 , 625 per theater average . Meanwhile , Focus ' Joe Wright directed period piece Anna Karenina also opened in 16 theaters , taking in an estimated 315 , 000 , good for a 19 , 688 average . Those figures certainly sound strong , so what ' s unremarkable about them ?
