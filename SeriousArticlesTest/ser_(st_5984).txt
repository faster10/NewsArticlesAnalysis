Ask Siri , " Do I need a raincoat today ? " and she ' ll look up the weather for you , replying helpfully , " It sure looks like rain today . " She ' s so generous , in fact , that she ' ll help you out before you even ask . Passively say , " I ' m in the mood for sushi , " and Siri comes to your aid : " I ' ve found a number of sushi restaurants , " she ' ll proclaim , adding in her characteristically specific fashion : " 22 of them are fairly close to you .
