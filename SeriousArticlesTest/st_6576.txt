Pelecanos : Collaboration versus solitude , of course . I actually like working with a bunch of creative people who come together to build something . After 10 years , the process still fascinates me . When you write for television , you have to come to terms with the fact that what you pen is not yours . Show runners , directors , actors , editors and costume designers are your co writers , in a sense , and often they elevate what you do . By my first love is writing novels . The books are all mine .
