A small ceremony , involving a signed souvenir shirt , took place in the home dressing room at the King Power Stadium after the game . " I signed his shirt because my signature is very important , " joked Ranieri . " I wrote ' Great achievement , great record , 11 games in a row ' and the date . Then I made everybody sign the shirt . Somebody sooner or later will break the record but I hope Jamie keeps on scoring and keeps the record for a long time . We ' re very , very proud about this record because everybody , all his team mates , helped him achieve it . I said two things to my players in the meeting before . One , win the match , second help Jamie achieve the record . We drew the match and I ' m pleased because the performance was good and I ' m very , very happy with the record . Fantastic . A great achievement . "
