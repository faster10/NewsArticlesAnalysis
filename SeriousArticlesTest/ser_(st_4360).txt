When I was a freshman at Yale , my roommate constantly played a Patti Smith record called " Rock and Roll Nigger . " I hated the song , but it never occurred to me that I should have called the police on my roommate . Part of the reason Yale paired me , an African American from Chicago , with my roommate , a Jewish kid from Brooklyn , was for us to learn how to work out our differences . We did , and now , 25 years later , we ' re still friends . Those kinds of lessons are what college is for , as much as anything you learn in the classroom .
