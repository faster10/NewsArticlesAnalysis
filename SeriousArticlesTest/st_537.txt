The re emergence of Thompson creates new problems for opponents who were already failing to contain Curry . After a relatively weak start to the season , Thompson has scored at least 20 points in five straight games and shot no worse than 44 . 4 percent from the field seven outings in a row . The Warriors have no reason not to depend on Curry as long as he fills the basket with elite efficiency , but Thompson ' s return to star quality scoring numbers is a clear positive for a team that thrives on balance . It remains to be seen if Thompson ' s injury will derail his current run of form , but he looks set to reclaim his status as a perennial contender for an All Star spot .
