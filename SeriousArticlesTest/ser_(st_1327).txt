Strangely , we seem unable to learn from our own history . In 1804 President Thomas Jefferson said " Enough " to paying 20 percent of the U . S . national budget as tribute to Barbary pirates .

The sailors and Marines sent on that mission did just that and in the process wrote a stirring page in our nation ' s early history .
