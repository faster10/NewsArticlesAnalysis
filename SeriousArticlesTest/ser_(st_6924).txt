Switching to a GST , a move business has urged for years , could increase revenue substantially , since any Indian who makes a purchase will pay the tax , says Rajiv Biswas , an economist in Singapore with research firm IHS Global Insight : The GST is the one reform that s really crucial among the ones stalled .

Most farmers are exempt , as are workers at small businesses . Sticking with today s system , Biswas says , is a lost cause .
