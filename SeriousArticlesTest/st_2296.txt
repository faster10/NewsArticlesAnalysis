With a lung busting run he made it into the area for the return pass but the referee penalised him for a foul on Ramos as he lost and regained the ball from the Spain defender . It was one of those fouls that probably would not have been given in the Premier League and the reaction summed up that frustration throwing his arms up at referee Jesus Gil Manzano .
