" It looks pretty hard , man , " Pace said Friday . " It ' s not a job that I have , obviously . He ' s a great player , man . We all have to do our part . Obviously , they ' re going to have eyes on him . The Giants do a good job of moving him around to different spots on the field , so you can ' t really key on him . It ' s going to take a full effort , different guys on him , getting hands on him , just make it a tough day for him . " ?
