Another Chrysler feature Barman likes is the trailer stability control system . " Sometimes , if you ' ve never towed a trailer before , or if maybe you have too much weight in the rear of the trailer , the trailer can start swaying back and forth , " Barman explained . " Well , this system uses sensors to determine yaw rate and lateral movement rate , and then provides brake pressure that is counter to the sway of the trailer to get it to settle down . "
