Here s a can t miss recipe for an unpleasant live TV moment : take one petrified ingenue , put her onstage in front of millions of viewers at home in a room full of weird , powerful men who work in an industry known for grinding young women into a gelatinous paste like substance and drinking it with dinner . This year s sacrifice is Corinne Foxx , daughter of Jamie Foxx . She might turn out to be a huge success like former winners Dakota Johnson and Laura Dern ? or she could end up like Candace Savalas , daughter of Telly Savalas , aka TV s Kojak .
