I think the NFL should start ejecting players for some of this stuff to show that it won t be tolerated . Just giving these guys a fine is a joke . As far as percentage of salary goes , that s probably like fining someone who makes minimum wage a nickel . Once they start ejecting them a lot of this bad behavior will go away . Except Burfict and Pacman are so stupid they d probably never play a full game because someone like Courtland Finegan would probably bait them to do something stoopid which they are all too wiling to oblige .
