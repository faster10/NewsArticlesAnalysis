If Trump had really gone too far , his opponents would do more than swap out adjectives . They d give a speech devoted to the topic ? or several of them ? making an argument in defense of the bedrock American values they say Trump is destroying . ? Or , they d make the case that this kind of policy shreds American values in just the way ISIS would like , turning the fight into one between the West and Islam . Privately , the strategists to these campaigns worry that there s already a cost to Trump s rhetoric . The cheers Trump gets for his no Muslims policy send the message overseas that there is a virulent anti Muslim feeling in America . Forget what the leaders say , goes the thinking , the cheering is the real truth of American sentiment . It will always have sway in a democracy . ?
