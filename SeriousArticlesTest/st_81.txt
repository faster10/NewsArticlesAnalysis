" My goal from the start of this process was to create the options necessary to safeguard the future of the Chargers franchise while respecting the will of my fellow NFL owners . Today we achieved this goal with the compromise reached by NFL ownership , " Spanos said . " The Chargers have been approved to relocate to Los Angeles , at the Inglewood location , at any time in the next year . In addition , the NFL has granted an additional 100 million in assistance in the event there is a potential solution that can be placed before voters in San Diego . I will be working over the next several weeks to explore the options that we have now created for ourselves to determine the best path forward for the Chargers . "
