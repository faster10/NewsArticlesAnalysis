" You ' re always chancing it when you come back , " said Romo , who said last week the chances of another break were high . " The hard part is playing when you ' re trying not to get hurt , which is silly . You can ' t do that . We knew that was part of it . Collarbones happen like that all the time . That ' s part of it . I ' m disappointed in costing our team a good chance to stay in the game early . . . . It ' s just a disappointing day . "
