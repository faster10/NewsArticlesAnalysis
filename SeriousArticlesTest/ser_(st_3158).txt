I first visited one of these enclaves in late January , when I travelled to Bozoum in the country ' s northwest . Passing through MISCA peacekeepers , I entered a corner of the town where several thousand people had sought refuge . Their fear was palpable . I could see it in their eyes , in their posture and most of all in their alertness to everything happening around them . In PK12 I hear similar stories of people displaced from their homes and then trapped during their flight to safety .
