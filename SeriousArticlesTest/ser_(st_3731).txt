Unlike most Indians used to looking at everything that China and Pakistan do together through the prism of an anti India conspiracy , Small is quite upbeat about the Chinese investments in Pakistan . He believes India , although it has territorial claims on Gilgit and Baltistan , will be the unlikely beneficiary of this . Small is of the view the investments might help stabilise Pakistan , become a catalyst for change within the country , which in turn could restrain temptations towards some set patterns of behaviour within Pakistan . He also dispels some of my myths about the Iran China friendship , and how Tehran has had problems with Chinese companies as well as the way the Chinese took advantage of Iran s straitened circumstances in the face of economic sanctions .
