First up is " Humboldt County . " It turns out this did get a theatrical release . It opened on nine screens in September and went down from there , so unless you actually live in Humboldt County , which is in far northern California , you probably missed it . And if the movie is to be believed , even if you do live there you probably still missed it , because you were otherwise engaged in farming illegal substances , gazing at the shoreline , and or hanging out with your quirky neighbors .
