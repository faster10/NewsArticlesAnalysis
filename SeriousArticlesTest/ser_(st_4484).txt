Gypsy Council chairman Joseph P Jones said it was a lot to spend and it would have been cheaper to let the travellers build their own housing . He said : ' The majority of new provision comes from the gipsy and traveller community itself , and because it is built by us and owned by us , it costs the council nothing and is generally better looked after . ' Residents of Carrswood View will pay 105 a week rent and 963 . 40 a year council tax , with 11 applicants hoping to move in next month .
