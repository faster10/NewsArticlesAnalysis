The rupiah started Thursday weaker and extended losses to 1 percent and a one week low of 13 , 960 per dollar after the attacks . The currency pared losses , tracking recovery in other Asian currencies on sharp gains in China ' s stocks . It briefly turned firmer , but failed to maintain the rebound and fell 0 . 6 percent to 13 , 905 .

BI was concerned lower domestic rates could spark capital outflows and weaken the rupiah .
