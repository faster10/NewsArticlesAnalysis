The administration has said al Assad has used chemical weapons . This is an abuse of international law and norms that cannot be allowed to stand , or it will send a message to other bad actors some of whom represent a direct threat to U . S . soldiers , private citizens and allies , as is the case in the Koreas , to choose one example . ( Iran ' s WMD threat to allies such as Israel , U . S . friends in the Gulf and U . S . military forces in the region is yet another . ) Further , if the United States does not act after the president had rightly declared such action would be unacceptable , it would undermine deeply and perhaps irreparably our credibility in the Middle East and worldwide .
