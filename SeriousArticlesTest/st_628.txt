Mac says : Seahawks 16 , Vikings 13 . Against the spread , home teams were just 112 133 8 against the spread this season according to TeamRankings . com . Although the same can be said about the Texans , they are 7 2 going into this game since their blowout loss to Miami with quality wins against the Bengals , Jets , and Colts . This has the makings of a defensive struggle , but I ll take Alex Smith s steadiness leading the Chiefs offense over Brian Hoyer .
