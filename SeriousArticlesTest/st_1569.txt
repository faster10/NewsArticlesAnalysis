MF : I just think that to focus on this issue is I think it s important , because the action caused a second , third , fourth order effect , that I don t think that the Turks clearly understood . I ve said this and I believe that Turkey needs to do more against the threat of the movement of foreign fighters in and out across their borders , some of the black market oil that s going across their borders . I also think that there needs to be greater cooperation by this international community along these borders , the sovereign borders that do exist , still exist , but are definitely challenged .
