I can tell you that I am deep in negotiations with Andre Dirrell ' s people right now to make their fight for the IBF world title , which was recently vacated by Carl Froch . My hope is to stage it on April 25 at the O2 Arena in London , but currently we are both pushing for home advantage . I am confident that with the backing of Sky Sports and James ' s profile in London , we can deliver him a home fight and a great deal for Dirrell .
