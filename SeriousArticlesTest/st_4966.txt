Fortunately for Ray , John Hancock ( Smith ) is on the case . Using his Superman like powers , Hancock flips Ray ' s car up and over in a neat backward somersault , safely out of harm ' s way . At the same time he thrusts out his arm and stops the train in its tracks . While Ray is grateful , the guy in the car underneath his isn ' t so sure and the damage to the derailed train stretches back a half mile or more .
