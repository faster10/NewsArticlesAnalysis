Meanwhile I see the Clinton Curse preparing to take down still others around the Clintons , for instance , Ms . Abedin , Ms . Mills , Mr Pagliano and Mr Sullivan . One really does not have to venture too close to the Clintons for the Curse to strike . One can merely be trying to sidestep , say Hillary s emails , and whammo . Think of poor Josh Earnest at his press briefing Friday . An inquisitive journalist asked him if he could say with certainty and confidence that Secretary Clinton will not be indicted because of this email scandal ? Instead of saying he could not comment on an ongoing investigation , Mr Earnest implied that he had been in communication with the Justice Department and prosecutors . He spoke of what we know from the Department of Justice . He authoritatively added that it does not seem to be headed in that direction . Who was he talking to ? What did they tell him ? Who authorized the president s press secretary to call the Justice Department ? Was Mr Earnest s comment a direction to the FBI to subside ?
