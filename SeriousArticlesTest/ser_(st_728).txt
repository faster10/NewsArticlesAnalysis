From the Saudi perspective , Iran s re entry into the global economy , post the Iran deal , sounds the death knell for its already declining economy , dependent by up to 80 percent on oil revenues ( in terms of the national budget , its share of the national GDP is 45 percent ) . The Shia Islamic Republic is a threat not just because it is Shia but also because it is a major oil producer that can add up to one million barrels in oil to the international market . As Iran increases its oil supply , the price of oil is likely to come down even further . While Saudi Arabia probably recognises this threat , the Saudi oil company Aramco refuses to cut supply . Speaking at Davos , Saudi Aramco Chairman Khalid Al Falih described the oil prices at below 30 a barrel as being irrational and held out optimistically that the price would be higher by the end of the year . He unequivocally said that Saudi Arabia never advocated balancing the market against the structural imbalance that was emerging . In other words , Saudi Arabia is not going to cede ground to Iran for the fear that it might capture some part of the oil market after a decrease in Saudi supply . The Kingdom and the Islamic Republic are caught up in a prisoner s dilemma . If there was any time that they needed to work together it would be this , but by executing Sheikh al Nimr earlier this month , Saudi Arabia showed that it has its own , more sinister calculations .
