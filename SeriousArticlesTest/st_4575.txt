But if Democrats want to be the feminist party , then they need to practice what they preach . Feminism is about real reform that helps women achieve true equality in a society where the cards are stacked against them . It ' s not a card to be played for political ends . As Carly Fiorina aptly said " My message to them potential supporters will be , ' Look , how about an honest woman , a competent woman ? How about a qualified woman ? ' But I ' m never going to ask for people ' s support because I ' m a woman . I ' m going to ask for their support because I ' m the most qualified candidate to beat Hillary Clinton and to do the job . "
