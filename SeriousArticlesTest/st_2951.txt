As objectionable as the prospect of Jones ' Quran burning is , it may not cease with the holy book of the Muslims . I have always maintained that this kind of vitriolic hatred of one religion is a descent on a slippery slope , as no one can say who will be next . I was not surprised , therefore , when I heard Jones recently agree , when asked to do so in an internet podcast interview , to burn " a couple of copies of the Talmud " too .
