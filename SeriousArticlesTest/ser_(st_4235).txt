This problem comes up for Romney again and again , often in the form of " gaffes " that are usually taken out of context , but still reveal a tin ear for the lives people lead . To take just one example , when Romney said " I like being able to fire people that provide services to me , " anyone who has ever been laid off recoiled in shock , whatever the context . Business owners and supervisors who have had to do the firing the humane ones , anyway know it can be a painful experience from the other side of the desk as well . It may be necessary at times , but you certainly wouldn ' t say you " like " it .
