I ' ve marked the line of scrimmage in bright red to make it easier to see . There are two Bengals linemen blocking downfield , including right guard Kevin Zeitler , who ( illegally ) barreled 3 yards upfield at the moment the ball was snapped . The three non Green receivers on the play don ' t run routes they run several yards forward at half speed and stare at Arizona ' s defensive backs without turning back to even see whether Dalton wants to throw them the football . The running back , Giovani Bernard , runs toward Dalton like he ' s going to take a handoff . Every aspect about this play suggests that nine of the 11 Cincinnati offensive players thought it was going to be a run .
