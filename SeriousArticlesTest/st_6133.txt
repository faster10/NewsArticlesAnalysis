There is not one Haitian that has not touched a soccer ball . Football is part of the everyday life of Haiti , even with the scary living conditions in Port au Prince , even with the fields being occupied , they still play soccer . It is the only entertainment reserved for everybody . At the federation we had the great idea of distributing in the temporary shelters the few soccer balls we were able to recover and it was an explosion of joy . I think it is necessary and mandatory , to help with the psychological recovery of a major part of the population , to free the fields and allow the people to release some stress .
