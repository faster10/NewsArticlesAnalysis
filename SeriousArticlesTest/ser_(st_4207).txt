" I think our execution was a problem for us all night , Brady said . That was things that were really self inflicted that I know we re capable of doing because we ve done it all year and for some reason last night we just couldn t get the communication right and we just weren t on the same page . They put a lot of pressure on us and I think the challenging part about that type of defense is they really test you in a lot of ways . They test your protections . They test you in the run game . They test you with different blitz looks and so forth . That s kind of the mark of their defense . ? If you don t really nail it to a T then they get a lot of free plays and I think there were a lot of free plays that I basically took the ball and tried to throw it away as fast as I could .
