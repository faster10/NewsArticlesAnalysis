The most odious of them all are special prosecutor Ken Kratz and former Manitowoc County sheriff Kenneth Peterson . Kratz sneered his way through Avery s second trial , pausing only to lick his lips and rub his sausage fingers together whenever granted the opportunity to discuss some deviant aspect of the alleged crime . His delicate , lilting voice puts me to sleep when it s not curdling my blood . I don t believe that you can spoil a true story , so I ll just come out and say that Kratz later resigned from his job after being caught sexually harassing domestic abuse victims .
