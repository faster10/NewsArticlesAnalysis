" Sharon was the best mother in law ! She was fun , energetic , loving , caring . I loved how she liked to get up go all the time . She would get you in check one minute give you a hug the next minute , " Burruss wrote . " I ' m so sad for ( Todd ) because they were so close . . . He talked to her every morning all thru out the day , every day . It ' s hard losing people that you love but when it ' s out of the blue with no warning it just makes it that much harder . "
