Rachel Nichols : Absolutely . There ' s definitely a " we ' re all in this together " feeling about it , at least for me . People love the word " catfight " they love to pit women against each other . One of the things I love about women in sports broadcasting is that you actually don ' t see that . You really see incredible support . I know it doesn ' t make for as sexy a story that that ' s the case , but it actually is the case and the fact that you see the colleagues that you respect doing so well is really fun and , again , moves the ball forward . The fact that Sage is hosting NBA Countdown is a great example . I don ' t think that job would have necessarily gone to a woman 20 years ago .
