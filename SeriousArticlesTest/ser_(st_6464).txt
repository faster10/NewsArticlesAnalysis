There ' s an amazing sense of pride when I see a kid experience that feeling on stage , where they ' ve connected with an audience or they get a round of applause because they ' ve worked really hard and have a great performance . It ' s an incredible feeling . I was really fortunate to have the opportunities that I did to learn music . And part of me feels very responsible to provide those opportunities for other people , because there were people along the way in my path and my musical journey that helped me .
