' We ' ve identified the last 15 overs of innings as an area where we can get better , ' said Anderson . ' I see myself bowling in that stage of a game and it ' s something we ' ll look at . I don ' t necessarily think it needs new skills and at this stage of my career I ' ve got enough up my sleeve to perform well . It ' s partly execution of each delivery and you ' ve got to be able to hit the right area with every ball .
