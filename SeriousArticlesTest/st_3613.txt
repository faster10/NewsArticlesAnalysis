I don t know how it is inside other clubs but in Germany we use the same phrase as you do here ? a lame duck . A lot of people thought it could be like this but it wasn t for us , thankfully . We didn t have big success because we didn t win the cup final but we were completely in the race , completely focused and nothing changed . At the start I had thought about really saying goodbye only on my last day , not before .
