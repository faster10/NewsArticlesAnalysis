What the Twitter ban indicates is that the Turkish leadership psychology is incapable of tackling effectively the myriad serious political , economic and external challenges facing the country . It does not appear inclined to implement structural and liberalizing reforms to prevent a " middle income trap " in other words a slow growth regime from taking hold . As I argued in a recent Chatham House report , in the absence of these reforms Turkish growth rates of 3 or lower will become the norm rather than the exception .
