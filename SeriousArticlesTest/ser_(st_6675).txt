No wonder John McCain and Lindsey Graham are so eager to get 10 , 000 U . S . ground troops into Syria . Folks in Peoria might think : if the Russians are willing to do something in Syria instead of the U . S . , that ' s great , that ' s one less thing that we have to do . Who cares if it bothers the Turkish government ? But that ' s not how McCain and Graham see the world . According to McCain and Graham , if Russia does something in Syria that the U . S . would do if the government of Turkey wouldn ' t object , that ' s a threat to our way of life .
