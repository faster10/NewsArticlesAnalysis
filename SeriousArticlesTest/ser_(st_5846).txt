This strange cartridge appeared around 1984 in a bright blue " T handle " casing that is very different from the standard , square , black Atari carts sold in North America , but is similar in style to those sold in Brazil . Furthermore , while a few second hand copies have been sold , no one can ever say they were the original owner . The mystery , as well as the fact there are only 12 known copies , make it a must have for serious Atari collectors .
