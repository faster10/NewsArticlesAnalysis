In response , Mars One issued a statement asking the UAE ' s Islamic authorities to cancel the fatwa , saying every precaution would be taken to reduce the risk to life . " If we may be so bold : the GAIAE should not analyze the risk as they perceive it today , " the statement says . " The GAIAE should assess the potential risk for humans as if an unmanned habitable outpost is ready and waiting on Mars . Only when that outpost is established will human lives be risked in Mars One ' s plan . "
