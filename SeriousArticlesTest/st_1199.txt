We have IS that has gone beyond being a regional threat , and they are actually a global threat as we have seen recently in Europe , in Paris , we saw in the US in California . And I know that there have been direct threats inside of Russia as well . So one : we have to clearly define our enemy we have to have similar criteria and then we have to figure out how it is that we are going to defeat this enemy to the point where we can return the region to some sort of stable platform . Otherwise we re going to be at this for a long time . When we play this sort of bully game against each other between the US and Russia , that is going to achieve nothing . It is going to achieve more conflict . . .
