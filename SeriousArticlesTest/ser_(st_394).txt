There was little to complain about on special teams this week . Punter Jordan Berry kicked a deep punt that Darrius Heyward Bey was able to down inside the five yard line in the third quarter , allowing the defense to force a three and out . Placekicker Chris Boswell went two for two in field goals , giving the Steelers the six points on the scoreboard in the first half . He added a successful point after try . Dri Archer and Brown continue to be unable to gain large returns .
