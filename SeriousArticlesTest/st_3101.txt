But forget all the unquantifiable stuff . Kobe is the reason that the Lakers once sold out 320 consecutive games in an arena that holds 18 , 997 . He ' s the reason they ' re still among the league ' s biggest draws . He ' s played roughly 1 , 300 games . If we ' re conservative and estimate 17 , 500 fans per game , that ' s 22 , 750 , 000 seats sold . NBA ticket prices average 50 per game ? and Lakers games typically average more than 100 . 328 , 238 , 062 doesn ' t sound so outrageous anymore , does it ? And we haven ' t even factored in the TV audience . The Lakers are a storied team in a major media market . But surely Kobe contributed more than any other player to the 3 billion deal the team signed with Time Warner in 2011 and to the franchise ' s 2 . 6 billion valuation .
