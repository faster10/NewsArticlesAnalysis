In such a culture , the leaders in Japan are often selected on a consensus basis . In other words , the leader is often the person who can best represent and voice the group ' s collective interests .

As a result , someone who has original or different ideas is more likely to be cast out of a group . This is opposite of the top down decision making process that is required for the leaders in Western countries .
