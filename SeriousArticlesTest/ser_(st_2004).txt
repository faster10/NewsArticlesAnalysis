The N . F . L . is making a parody out of the idea that it is a league defined by parity . For the first time in its history , five teams remain undefeated through six weeks . The Green Bay Packers , the Denver Broncos and the Cincinnati Bengals are 6 0 , while the New England Patriots and the Carolina Panthers are 5 0 . A parity driven league could be defined as one in which all teams have similar records or one in which the top teams vary from year to year right now , neither definition can be applied .
