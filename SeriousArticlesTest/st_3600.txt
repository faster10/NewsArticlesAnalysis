I know that , if you did not stay up late to watch the No . 1 vs . No . 2 showdown , you may think this is an overly breathless account of what was really only a pretty good basketball game . It is not that . If you didn t watch the game , I will not recount it for you , because you do not deserve that . The game featured dozens of dives to the court , shots that were swatted into the stands , three technical fouls , plenty of negligent officiating on both sides , an iconic performance by a star player and a heroic defensive effort to try and stop him . It was two beautiful basketball teams in a tit for tat tradeoff of back and forth basketball in its finest . " We played our butts off , they played their butts off , " Self said afterward .
