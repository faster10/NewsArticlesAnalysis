Protests against police : I believe there is a big question about what goes on before those tapes show blacks being misused or shot by the police . Why are the police there to begin with ? Police officers are being called every rotten name in the book and some you have never heard of , plus they are shot at by people who are carrying illegal firearms . If the police don ' t shoot first , they will be shot . How do all the protesters find the time for protesting ? Don ' t they have to work ? Is someone paying them , or are they on welfare ?
