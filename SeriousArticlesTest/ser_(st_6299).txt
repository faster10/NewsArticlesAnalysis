Watching Anthony Davis play when he is healthy is a thing of beauty . The superstar scored 32 points with 19 rebounds , one assist , two steals and four blocks to help the Pelicans claim their second straight win . As long as the Pelicans can stay somewhat competitive in the West and Davis can stay healthy , he should be a top 3 asset the rest of the way . Ryan Anderson was coming off two straight 30 point performances and stayed hot with 29 points and four treys in 33 minutes . Even with Davis healthy , Anderson will still get his minutes and is a must start player . He won t stay this hot forever , though .
