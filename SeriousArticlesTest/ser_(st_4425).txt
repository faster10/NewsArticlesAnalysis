The national exam is scheduled for November 23 , and Amnesty International is calling for the government of Sierra Leone to lift the ban , citing the fact that in addition to the stigma created by the ban , if many of these girls are not allowed to take the exams it will adversely affect their entire future . Experts also say that the ban is also violation of the human rights of these Sierra Leone girls . The discriminatory exclusion of the pregnant girls from mainstream schools and critically important exams , like the upcoming national one , is denying them education simply because of an act that legally these girls cannot participate in to begin with . Few of these young girls get pregnant on purpose and the ban is only serving to reinforce a stigma that shames and blames these pregnant girls . In fact , according to Sierra Leone s 2012 Sexual Offenses Act , children under the age of 18 are legally capable of consenting to sex and thus anyone below that age who is pregnant is technically a victim of rape .
