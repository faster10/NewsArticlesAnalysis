" This one is unusual because of the time period over which so many birds died , " said LeAnn White , a field investigator with the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison , Wisconsin . The center , part of the U . S . Geological Survey , is receiving samples from Arkansas , where as many as 5 , 000 red winged blackbirds and starlings fell from the sky in a square mile area in less than an hour on New Year ' s Eve , according to the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission .
