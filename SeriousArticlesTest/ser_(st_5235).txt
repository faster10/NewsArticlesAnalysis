Following the execution of a Shiite cleric , Nimr Al Nimr , by Saudi Arabia on grounds of subversion and treason against the kingdom , the Iranian religious authority was incensed . Describing Al Nimr as a martyr , Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei charged that this oppressed scholar had neither invited people to armed movement , nor was involved in covert plots . In his tweets , he added that the only act of Al Nimr was outspoken criticism , and said that the unfairly spilled blood of oppressed martyr Al Nimr will affect rapidly and divine revenge will seize Saudi politicians . Such messages were inflammatory enough to send a pack of angry Iranians to the Saudi Embassy in Tehran and the Saudi consulate in Mashhad , where they ransacked the buildings and set them ablaze , all the while chanting anti Saudi slogans .
