Of course , you can t be a woman in this world without getting good at it , and Clinton handled all these questions really well , even the humility one . She s clearly made her peace with the gendered implications of such questions and uses them as an opportunity to talk about her feelings and other such stuff that men don t have to talk about , but women have to , lest they get accused of being ice monsters . This was particularly effective on both the right wing attack question , where she revealed that such stuff does stress her out ( before pivoting to how she learned to be strong ) , and on the humility question , which she used as a chance to talk about family and love . It s all very Oprah Winfrey , but clearly what you need when you re vying to be the first female President .
