A few weeks ago , Allyson Felix watched as Jeneba Tarmoh took a celebratory lap at the Olympic Trials , apparently the third qualifier for the Olympics in the women ' s 100 meters . But Friday , it ' s Felix who will take to the blocks in a quest to finally win a gold medal . There was a second look at the photo finish . The two sprinters had tied , officials ruled . Then the track bosses scrambled to figure out a way to break the tie and decide who would run the event in London . On the day of a scheduled runoff , Tarmoh backed out . She ' s still part of the U . S . team , but she ' s a member of the relay pool . On Friday , Felix will race twice , seeking a spot in one of Saturday ' s semifinals .
