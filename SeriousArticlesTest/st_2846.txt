Concepcion Picciotto began protesting against nuclear proliferation in 1981 , when it was an enormous political issue . For those of you not old enough to remember , just do a web search on " No Nukes Concert " to see how big the movement was , at the time . Picciotto joined a protest across the street from the White House back then , and she essentially never left . Her three decade long stand is now being called " the longest running act of political protest in U . S . history . "
