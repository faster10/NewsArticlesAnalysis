You beat the Steelers by throwing downfield , given that they ' re 30th in the league in QBR against throws traveling 16 or more yards in the air , but does that sound like the Broncos these days ? Manning ( 28th ) and Osweiler ( 33rd ) were among the worst quarterbacks in the league by QBR on those same passes . Tom Brady hasn ' t been an effective deep passer in a long time , and the Chiefs are so reticent to throw the ball downfield that they sprang Albert Wilson open for a would be touchdown in the first quarter , missed the throw and never took another shot downfield . Two road games would be tough , and the Patriots in New England would be a brutal matchup , but there ' s some hope to work with here if you ' re a Pittsburgh fan .
