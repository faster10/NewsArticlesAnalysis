Peter Head : In the end of course it functions in a sort of evolutionary and changing way , so you can ' t say you design a city and you know how it ' s going to perform . What you have to do is design the basic infrastructure that ' s the green parks , the public transports , the roads that don ' t get changed later and then allow people and their ingenuity to develop it in a way that is appropriate to the time and to change it and develop it . The public spaces are great places that encourage the culture , the life and the vibrancy of the city .
