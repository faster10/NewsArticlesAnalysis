So when I speak with Republicans who have been around awhile and who have served in top government jobs , Cabinet posts or even in the White House , they ' re genuinely upset . Not because they support Romney or Rick Perry or Newt Gingrich , but because they believe that Cain just might be sucking all of the oxygen out of the GOP race . And , more to the point , they worry his antics and his behavior could bleed onto the GOP field , as if the pursuit of beating Barack Obama is somehow trivial . While the other candidates treat him like the silly uncle , he ' s becoming dangerous to their own brand .
