Many of the " sources " for my story my mother and her friends , my father ' s older sister , his other wives and mistresses were now in their 70s or 80s . At first , they all insisted that they had forgotten most of what happened . But I asked to speak with them anyway , always arranging to meet them early enough in the day that they weren ' t tired and to make sure that they had all afternoon and evening free if necessary , so that we wouldn ' t be cut short . Luckily , their mental faculties were still intact . Once they got started , one memory led to another , and I ended up talking with them for hours and filling notebook after notebook . Their recall became particularly sharp when they were telling me why something I thought I knew was wrong . The urge to correct the record , I discovered , is a powerful aide memoire .
