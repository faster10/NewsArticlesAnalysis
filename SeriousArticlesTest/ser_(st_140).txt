Sanders came out strong , handling a number of complex , hard hitting questions about his policy proposals . The first question , about how he can justify a tax raise on struggling middle class workers , was a tough one , and Sanders handled it perfectly : He argued that a 500 a year tax raise to pay for single payer health care would be offset by not having to pay 5 , ooo a year in health insurance premiums . And while there is debate over whether Sanders s plan would be as inexpensive as he says , he is not wrong to say that the cost of it has to be weighed against the cost of insurance premiums ? and that single payer countries have lower health care costs than we do .
