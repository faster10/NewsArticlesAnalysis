A decade after Akhenaten and Nefertiti had launched their religious revolution , some evidence suggests that Egypt may have been hit by a terrible epidemic . Desperate to ensure the continuation of his new monotheistic religion , and perhaps fearful of death , Akhenaten decided to appoint his queen , Nefertiti , as co ruler . He did so just in the nick of time ? for within a few months he did indeed die . His young eight year old son , Tutankhamun ( at that stage called Tutankhaten ) , became pharaoh and Nefertiti ( now only using her new longer pharaonic name ) continued as co ruler with him , says a leading historian of the period , Dr Aidan Dodson of the University of Bristol , author of two major books on the era ? Amarna Sunrise and Amarna Sunset .
