Also interesting is that Driver ( despite reports he was so intense he never took his mask off on set ) shot some of his Kylo Ren scenes sans mask , with the mask later digitally inserted over his face . Based on his comments , Episode VIII may be a lot more challenging . It s much darker , he said , but we re very excited . If Episode VIII can match the heights of that film than Star Wars fans are in for a treat . While many expected Star Wars : The Force Awakens to earn the top spot at the box office for the fourth consecutive weekend , it was Leonardo DiCaprio and his flick The Revenant that came damn close to unseating the movie titan . However , now it appears some want the original director back to helm the final installment , Star Wars : Episode IX , instead of Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow .
