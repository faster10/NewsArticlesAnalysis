Four year ago , exit polls in Iowa showed 46 percent of GOP caucus goers not making up their minds until the week before the vote . One third of them sided with Rick Santorum , resulting in a 34 vote loss for Mitt Romney ( although we didn t really know that for six weeks ) , the frontrunner going into the weekend before that year s vote . If the current Iowa polls are to believed and Trump has regained the lead over Cruz , why mess with that momentum ?
