The Islamic State is on the offensive , and we must do more to counter their fighters and eviscerate their infrastructure . But this also means identifying and cutting off their sources of supply and funding ? ? namely the oil fields along Syria ' s eastern border . We need to either destroy the fields with airstrikes or take them and hold them with a coalition of local ( Iraqi , Turkish and Kurdish ) ground troops and Western military advisers and Special Operations forces . The United States can lead the way in developing a political framework and military strategy that enables this to happen . Ongoing military and economic development assistance to these nations would have to be tied to their cooperation in securing the Syrian oil fields .
