Kitted out in style , head for the Gare St . Lazare station and follow the chic Parisiens taking the train to the twin resorts of Deauville and Trouville on the Normandy coast . They ' re as different as chalk and cheese Deauville , with its upscale boutiques and boardwalk emblazoned with the names of Hollywood stars , looks like a location for a Ralph Lauren resort catalog . Trouville is laid back , charming and family friendly don ' t miss the fabulous brasserie Les Vapeurs for a dinner that could turn into a wild night . You can walk from one town to the other .
