I first met Wu at a conference several years ago , at a time when there were very few women in China ' s weiquan or " rights defense " movement . It was common back then for male colleagues to publicly address them as " babes " or " little sisters , " even in professional and ostensibly progressive settings . As women ' s rights activists , Wu and others fight on two fronts : against overt rights violations by the Chinese government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second class citizens .
