The voice is a very sensitive instrument . It ' s not that easy , it ' s not just going out there and singing and your voice comes out . It would be so easy if it was like that . Can you imagine how hard it is without a microphone to have the force and the power to sound through an orchestra of 80 people playing loud music ? That ' s not normal , right ? You have to be patient and focused and to love what you do and to understand there are lots of moments where you feel very down .
