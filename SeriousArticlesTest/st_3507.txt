Two Oscar contenders finished in third and fourth place with almost identical weekend grosses not to mention almost identical totals . " Silver Linings Playbook " dropped by an incredibly small 7 percent in its 11th weekend to 10 million . Weinstein ' s 21 million drama continues to benefit from great word of mouth . And with 69 . 5 million so far and another month until the Oscars still to go , director David O . Russell ' s Playbook is on track to finish above 100 million . " Zero Dark Thirty , " meanwhile , fell by a steeper 38 percent to 9 . 8 million and 69 . 9 million total in its sixth weekend . The 40 million Sony drama will need to notch better holds if it wants to join fellow Best Picture nominees Argo , Lincoln , Django Unchained , Les Miserables , and Life of Pi in the 100 million club .
