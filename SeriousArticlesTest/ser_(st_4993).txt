A new album " is all mainly dictated by whoever ' s doing my business end of it . I consider myself semi retired . Every time I make an album , I go , ' That ' s the last one , ' " the native Oklahoman said in a voice as rich and peppery as barbecue sauce . " That ' s somebody else ' s idea to make a record and go out and play . I generally don ' t go out and tour much anymore never did , much . I don ' t really hustle that . . . . On a good day , I ' m feeling good , I say I ' ll make another record and go on tour , and on a bad day , I ' ll say , ' What have I committed myself to ? ' "
