While Rubio and Cruz got a debate bounce , Jeb Bush continued to falter . Bush fell from 7 . 0 percent to 6 . 0 percent in the past few weeks , and his trajectory looks downright grim . In fact , he ' s now flirting with following Carly into the ranks of the below four percenters . Two of his latest polls showed Bush at just four percent support , a new low for Jeb . If he does continue his polling slide , it ' s likely his donors will flee when he can ' t even manage to hit the five percent mark . For now , Bush still remains viable he definitely still deserves to be on the main stage but only for now . If he falls much further , he ' ll likely never recover .
