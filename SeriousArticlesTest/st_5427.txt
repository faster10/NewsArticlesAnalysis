The Rafale deal is very important for the French defence industry in view of India s world standing . India was thus at an advantageous position . With the Egypt and Qatar contracts sealed and talks with UAE and Malaysia , the situation has somewhat changed a little . For the IAF , 36 is too small a number to make a sizable operational fleet and will not make good the depleting numbers of IAF s air assets . Already down to 33 fighter squadrons vis vis the authorised 42 , there is speculation that the IAF could procure more aircrafts . Fewer numbers would also mean no Technology Transfer and make India dependent on Dassault Aviation for next the four decades for sustenance , upgrade and obsolescence management . For Make in India , Dassault was unwilling to be held liable for quality control of aircraft manufactured under license by HAL . The grapevine says that the remaining 60 to 90 aircrafts could be built in India by a private player . The defence arm of Anil Ambani group is the lead contender . Dassault had earlier offered to help Reliance create the Rs 1500 crore ( US 240 million ) factory in Bangalore to produce the wings of the aircraft . Group Company Reliance Infra announced on 5 November 2015 that they were exiting cement and road business to monetise and concentrate on defence . They had earlier acquired controlling stake in Pipavav Defence . If the private sector gets into the Rafale deal , in a single stroke of action , the Indian industry would come in a big way into aircraft building , something which has been dithering since it was opened in 2001 .
