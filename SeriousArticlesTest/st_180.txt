It s trite to point out , but no less true : Nobody had seen ( or heard ) anything like him in pop music before . Here was a guy performing with cabaret glam theatricality in women s clothing ? but he was playing loud , tough , hummable rock songs . It started Bowie on the road to being a barrier busting hero who acted as an avatar for gender fluidity before that was even a term . ( He stayed loyal to the cause : In 2014 he appeared in a PSA with Tilda Swinton that declared Gender is between your ears , not between your legs . ) But the fundamental power of the tunes on Ziggy Stardust could not be denied , and the album helped launch Bowie into the orbit of stars such as Mick Jagger . David was always an inspiration to me and a true original , Jagger told EW in a statement . He was wonderfully shameless in his work , we had so many good times together .
