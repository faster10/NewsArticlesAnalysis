Gupta : You know it ' s funny , I think that probably anybody could get motion sickness . When I rode with the Blue Angels , I was talking to some of the pilots ahead of time , because I know that I ' m pretty prone to motion sickness . I have certain techniques that I ' ve taught myself so that I can ward off some of the awful symptoms . But some of the pilots I was talking to said they never and these are Naval pilots they go on boats and they fly planes : two things that you could really be subjected to it and they said that they ' ve never been motion sick , which I thought was kind of interesting . The trainer of the pilots said all of these guys on their first couple of rides lost their cookies , at least once .
