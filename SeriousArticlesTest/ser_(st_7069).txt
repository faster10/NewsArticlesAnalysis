The Tuesday before Christmas , about halfway through the 10 episode series , I tweeted Am I the only one who kinda has a crush on Dean Strang from MakingaMurderer ? The internet s reply was swift : no . Not at all . The tweet has been liked more than 70 times , proving that there are a fair few people out there crushing on the short , glasses wearing , nebbishy Wisconsin lawyer . Strang and his co counsel Jerry Buting are the moral centers of an otherwise disheartening tale of justice gone terribly wrong , and what s more attractive than kindness ?
