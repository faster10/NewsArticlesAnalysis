The roster of potential free agents looks like a multi generational Dream Team : Durant , LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , Dwight Howard , Dirk Nowitzki , Pau Gasol ? plus Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan , if they decide to delay their possible retirements . As a whole , it might not be considered a monster free agent class , but it includes several players who have the potential to alter the entire course of a franchise simply by scrawling their name on a contract . And with an influx of money that is expected to significantly raise the league s salary cap , teams will also have to be pay big for the services of the next tier of potential free agents like Mike Conley , Al Horford , Joakim Noah , Chandler Parsons , DeMar DeRozan , Roy Hibbert , Joe Johnson , Rajon Rondo , Andre Drummond , Bradley Beal and Deron Williams .
