One thing that has really influenced me with Bowie where I ve taken an approach from him is how he changes from album to album and has always modified his sound and his appearance . I think that s an important thing . I think if an artist stays stagnant in one style , you end up becoming stagnant artistically in your songwriting . You get bored , and that s one thing I don t want to get is bored when making albums . I always feel like I have to change styles and keep on evolving . I would definitely become less inspired if I had to stay in one format . That was always the approach , especially from my perspective . I was always trying to influence the albums to change and to evolve , and I ve taken that approach with my solo stuff and with the Wildabouts .
