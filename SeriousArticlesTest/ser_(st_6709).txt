Sharapova took her defeat well enough . She has had plenty of practice . Asked to explain how she could put 16 aces past Lauren Davis last Friday , followed by 21 when she beat Belinda Bencic two days ago and only three against Williams ? with seven double faults ? she said : If you re serving maybe 180kph against somebody else , that s an ace . Against Serena , as we all know , the return is one of her great strengths . She s very explosive . She stays quite close to the baseline . She cuts the ball early . She doesn t give you many angles . That s the reason I can t get so many free points against her .
