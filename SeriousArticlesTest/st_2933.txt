So when " 45 Years " comes along , it ' s more than a first rate film showing up and doing its job . It ' s cathartic , and moving , without any of the usual obvious contrivances or manipulations . Opening in limited release in New York and LA late last year , and a success throughout 2015 on the international festival circuit , writer director Andrew Haigh ' s portrait of a marriage hobbled by an old , absent love should ' ve made my Top 10 list for 2015 . That ' s a painful thing to admit , and that ' s what a second viewing will do to you , sometimes , with performance driven films of a certain quality .
