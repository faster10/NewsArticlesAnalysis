Before the meeting , Mr Kerry said : The one thing we could say to those people is that what they do in this is stiffen our resolve , all of us , to fight back , to hold people accountable , and to stand up for rule of law , which is exactly what we are here to do . And if they ve done anything , they ve encouraged us today to do even harder work to make progress and to help resolve the crises that we face .
