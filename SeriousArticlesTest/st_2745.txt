This wouldn ' t be just four Liverpudlians sitting around in a room with guitars , drum and a piano serving the muse . Tim would first have to tear down the wall of his warehouse in Texas to put in windows for the proper light , build all the furniture himself to recreate Vermeer ' s room from the 17th Century , grind his own lenses , grind his own 17th century style pigments ( many of which are illegal today because they ' re so poisonous ) , mix his own paint and after all that and more , then he could start the backbreaking and mind numbing work of painting with his machine . It would cost him more money and man hours than all the Beatle albums put together .
