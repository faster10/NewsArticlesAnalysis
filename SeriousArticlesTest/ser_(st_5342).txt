A BBC spokesman added : ' The BBC invests more in television at Christmas than any other UK broadcaster . Well over 90 of programmes in peak time on BBC1 will be brand new , including Roald Dah ' s Esio Trot , Harry Hill ' s Professor Branestawm and the final two episodes of Miranda , plus specials from Doctor Who , Call the Midwife , Mrs Brown ' s Boys and Still Open All Hours . There are some carefully chosen repeats in the mix including family favourites and much loved treats from previous years including Royle Family and Vicar of Dibley . '
