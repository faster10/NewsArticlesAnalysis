In the 1970s " pyramid power " was a popular trend , with some people believing in the supernatural powers of the pyramids . Jim and Linda Onan were two such people , and at the time , their house was full of pyramids . Linda used to joke to her husband that he should build their next house in a pyramid shape so she could stop looking at all of the little ones inside of it , and in 1977 he did , painting it gold and surrounding it by a moat .
