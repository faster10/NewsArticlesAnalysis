" Spartacus " may wrap sooner than many fans might like , yet the historical drama actually survived longer than most expected . The show has had a wild and difficult run since it launched on Starz two years ago . The first season was a phenomenon . Its violent comic book imagery may have been inspired by the hit film " 300 , " but " Spartacus ' " operatic computer assisted visual style and profanely quotable Shakespean esque dialogue quickly established the show as singularly unique . Ratings started modest , then climbed with nearly every episode , eventually hitting about 6 million viewers when including all encore airings and viewing platforms .
