It ' s hard to imagine that many people once lived here , as we drive into the center of town . That ' s what strikes you first about the exclusion zone what you can ' t see , the people . Even though I know the residents have been evacuated , it is still eerie to be in a town where it seems the people have simply evaporated . Bicycles near a bus stop lie tipped over , as if owners forgot to retrieve them . Cars sit in a shopping center , seemingly waiting to have groceries loaded into them . A 7 Eleven convenient store sits in disarray , the items shaken from the shelves from the March 11 earthquake . These communities are complete ghost towns , frozen in time .
