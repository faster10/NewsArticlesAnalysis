SENATE PASSES NDAA , OBAMA WILL SIGN DESPITE GITMO RESTRICTIONS America ' s supermax prison wardens must be so offended by this . Jessica Schulberg : " The Senate voted 91 3 to approve the National Defense Authorization Act on Tuesday . The defense authorization bill contains legal obstacles to closing the Guantanamo Bay prison facility , including a prohibition on using funds to transfer the prisoners to the U . S . or to build facilities to house them in the future . Because this is the president s last year to close Guantanamo , provisions about the prison were once expected to be the center of a charged debate in Congress . But even lawmakers who support closing Guantanamo made little mention of the notorious prison facility after casting their votes . . . Almost immediately after Tuesday ' s vote , White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the president would not veto the bill , which now has a veto proof majority in both chambers of Congress .
