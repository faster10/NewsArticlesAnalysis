A final thing that has hardened attitudes is what happened to shadow ministers when they returned to their offices after Tuesday s shadow cabinet meeting . Jeremy Corbyn had asked them to spend time in their constituencies consulting with their members . But as they walked into their offices they were informed their parliamentary email accounts had started filling up with demands they oppose military action . The wording on the emails was almost identical , and closely echoed the words used by the Corbynite campaign group Momentum in its communication to its own members . It subsequently emerged the wording was being circulated by Simeon Andrews , a close ally of the shadow chancellor , John McDonnell .
