Aronson : This is a huge problem . We have a population of 7 billion people in the world 2 . 2 billion of them are children . Probably half of those children are at risk for poverty , and lack of access to medical care , education and social support . Orphans , whether they be true orphans , double or single , or children living without parental care because they ' re children whose parents are unable to parent them children are at risk . The number from UNICEF that you see everywhere is 153 million children who are considered orphans , less than 18 , loss of one or both parents . And that number is just horrific . The horror of it means that these are children at risk : for early marriage , living in the streets , prostitution , child labor , and finally the worst ever children who end up exploited by adults , and traded and trafficked .
