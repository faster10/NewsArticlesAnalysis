The Stop Online Piracy Act works by cutting off the money to foreign illegal sites and making it harder for online criminals to market and distribute illegal products to U . S . consumers . The bill includes provisions that " follow the money " to cut off the main sources of revenue to these sites , and also protects consumers from being directed to foreign illegal websites by search engines . And it provides innovators with a way to bring claims against foreign illegal sites that steal and sell their technology , inventions and products .
