Monica ' s not the only warrior in this family . Jenny calls Tony a daddy warrior because he always stood by Monica and their family . " I actually considered not marrying him because I wasn ' t the person he agreed to marry , " Monica says . " But then I realized he loves me . He ' s here , and he ' s my heart . I ' m still a woman , and I still have a heart and a mind , regardless of whether I have arms or legs . "
