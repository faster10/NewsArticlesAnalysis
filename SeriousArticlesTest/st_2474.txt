6 . At 1 : 07 , ACARS ( the Automatic Communication and Reporting System ) gives what turns out to be its final report . Also at this time , it was alleged that an additional waypoint not on the original flight plan had been entered into the flight management computer . The implication is that someone in the cockpit had intent to veer off course for nefarious purposes . I believe that if indeed a waypoint was entered and it seems difficult to verify with the ACARS no longer reporting it was entered as a means to identify an equal time point . Such a point is a position on the route that indicates the flight is equal in time to two or more diversionary airports . It is a required dispatch calculation prior to departure but an optional entry on the flight management computer .
