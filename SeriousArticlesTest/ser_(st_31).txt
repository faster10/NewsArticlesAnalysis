I ve been in the job long enough to not expect any weaknesses from Sam Allardyce , he said . With Sunderland what is at stake with the Premier League teams is that they are scared to go down with the new TV deal coming in next year . I don t see why the FA Cup should be ostracised or be neglected because of the Premier League . When you play in the Champions League , you play midweek . Why should you not play Saturday , Tuesday or Wednesday ? It s no problem .
