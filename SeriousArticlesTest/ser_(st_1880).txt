At the Bastille yesterday , Hollande stated very clearly his intent to spear a new anti austerity movement in Europe and the world at large . The challenge is momentous . He must first convince Merkel to let the ECB play a bigger part in the euro ' s recovery . Will Hollande succeed where Sarkozy failed ? It is possible , after all . Merkel and Hollande may belong to two different political families this detail alone never derailed the formidable entente between Mitterrand and Kohl . Besides , Hollande doesn ' t need being convinced that Germany is France ' s most important ally . In 2007 , Sarkozy very openly snubbed Merkel , by looking instead towards the U . S . and Britain . Only circumstances made him reconsider . Merkozy was never a natural duo .
