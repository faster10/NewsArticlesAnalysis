Ruah : Chris and Eric Olsen are really into real estate . Everybody ' s on the same page , they ' re just a few years ahead of me . They ' ve had this experience before I ' ve never had this experience before . Before , when I rented , I was like I ' m just going to buy cheap because I ' ll get rid of it in a year or two and all of a sudden you ' re buying for five to 10 years .
