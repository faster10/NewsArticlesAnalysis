I became an actor to change the way I grew up . The way I grew up , I never saw myself on screen . I have two older sisters . One ' s an investment banker . The other one is a doctor , and I never saw us being played as investment bankers . And I realized how limiting that was for me . I would look at the screen and think , ' Well , there ' s no way I can do it , because I ' m not there . ' And it ' s like as soon as you follow your dreams , you give other people the allowance to follow theirs . "
