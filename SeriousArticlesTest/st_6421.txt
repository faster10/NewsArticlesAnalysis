When I sat in the theater in Petersburg , Virginia , in 1977 and saw " Star Wars " ( I refuse to call it " A New Hope " ) I walked away with a vision of not only how good can triumph over evil but how seeing a movie could be the coolest thing to ever happen to me . I was there for " Empire " and " Jedi " and read everything I could about the movies . I had the toys and waited for the sequels you promised us .
