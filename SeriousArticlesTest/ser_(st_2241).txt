Scholars point to the date on which Columbus set sail as further evidence of his true motives . He was originally going to sail on August 2 , 1492 , a day that happened to coincide with the Jewish holiday of Tisha B ' Av , marking the destruction of the First and Second Holy Temples of Jerusalem . Columbus postponed this original sail date by one day to avoid embarking on the holiday , which would have been considered by Jews to be an unlucky day to set sail . ( Coincidentally or significantly , the day he set forth was the very day that Jews were , by law , given the choice of converting , leaving Spain , or being killed . )
