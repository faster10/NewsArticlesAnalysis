Justice regarding Laquan ' s killing is hopefully obvious . Justice regarding the 400 day coverup is woefully , sadly and in the tradition of American oppression being bandied about with an adroitness that would make Bull Connor and George Wallace proud . It reminds me of the Emmet Till acquittal . This irrefragably diabolical and dastardly killing is matched only by it ' s headlined coverup . How does the mayor and his city Council approve an unsolicited 5 , 000 , 000 payout to the bereaved family ( sequestered during the mayoral 2015 election ) , cut the check and not know why ? In the words of the late great Mayor Harold Washington , " Chicago needs a laxative ! " We must flush Mayor Rahm Emanuel , his syncophanic Aldermen , Chicago Police Superintendent Garry ' the Bronx Bulldog ' McCarthy , States Attorney Anita Alvarez et al down the toilet of accountability and justice .
