Since the early days , the R A has established a rota of British seaside " links " courses to host the event . The major difference between a links course and a parkland course such as Augusta is that it is far less manufactured . Links courses are constructed out of the sandy , windswept coastal terrain , with few " man made " additions . Players are faced with thick rough , narrow undulating fairways that snake around dunes , and lightening quick greens . There are far fewer trees and water hazards . When the wind gusts these courses demand the highest level of skill and imagination .
