The best way to explore the boutiques is to hire a car and driver for half a day and hand over a list of hot addresses . These should include Anokhi , Abraham Thakore and Le Mill , but at a top hotel like the Taj Mahal Palace , the concierge will know the names of even newer , hotter places shoppers may want to add . The hotel has one of the world ' s best urban outdoor pools , perfect for post shop chilling in a hectic town .
