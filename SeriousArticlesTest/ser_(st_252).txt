Fantasy watch : Everyone looked pretty good Sunday from a fantasy standpoint . But the two most important takeaways were that Brees ' low TD total from early in the year was a fluke I called it a statistical anomaly on Sunday morning since he was still averaging more than 300 passing yards per game and that Brandin Cooks ( two TDs ) is starting to heat up . The Saints have had more success finding favorable matchups for Cooks , especially since they started using him in more three tight end sets .
