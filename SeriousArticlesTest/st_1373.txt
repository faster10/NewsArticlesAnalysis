In the real world , Barbie is constantly being attacked for being an unrealistic influence on girls . Her is body is ridiculously out of proportion and all her material possessions encourage vanity and selfishness . So of course the film is going to portray her that way these are Barbie stereotypes , not female ones . If anything , " Toy Story 3 " plays on the perception of Barbie and then gives the blond doll a positive spin by making her a girl willing to give up the dream house life with Ken to fight for what ' s right her pride and friends .
