The zone scheme would put Osweiler on the move . The beauty is that the types of throws that blossom here don t require great arm strength . Kubiak , you might recall , had a lot of success coaching Matt Schaub . When you move the quarterback or the pocket , the field effectively slices in half . ( Quarterbacks don t throw back across the field , away from their rollout , unless it s a designed throw against the grain . ) Thus , there are fewer reads and simpler either or decisions to sort through . This can be especially helpful for a quarterback whose first NFL start is coming on the road against his former coach . John Fox is one of the few people in the league who is familiar with the specifics of Osweiler s weaknesses . You can bet Fox and defensive coordinator Vic Fangio will confer with Adam ? Gase ( Osweiler s former position coach ) and gather the exact schematic wrinkles that Osweiler will least want to see .
