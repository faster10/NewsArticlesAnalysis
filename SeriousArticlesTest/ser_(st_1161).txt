Even with garbage time taking up a huge chunk of that and Leonard only playing 26 minutes , Leonard has to get more shots than that . The Warriors sent double teams on Leonard off the roll when he was the screener , and swarmed him on drives . That took him out of the game . This isn ' t necessarily any sort of huge problem , he had a bad game , the Spurs had a bad game , it happens . However , think back to the series vs . the Clippers . Leonard was gradually removed from impact by the L . A . defense over the course of that series . This is a problem .
