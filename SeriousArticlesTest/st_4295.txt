You can imagine , then , how annoyed ? Khloe Kardashian would have been when her younger sister Kylie openly ripped off a look that Khloe had designated for her new book , and paraded it in public months before the book came out . It wouldn ' t matter so much if nobody saw it , but the ultra high cut , black studded , one piece swimsuit was hard to miss . Kylie wore it out with jeans back in August 2015 , and of course got splashed all over the media in it . Khloe ' s book , meanwhile , didn ' t come out until the end of 2015 . So the surprise element Khloe was counting on ? was ruined .
