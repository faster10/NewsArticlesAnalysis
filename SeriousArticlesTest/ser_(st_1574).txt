MF : Yeah , I know he said that and I disagree with that . I definitely disagree with that . I disagree with the context of how we have said our strategy is working or not working . I do believe that the U . S . must step up into a greater leadership role . One of the big issues , Sophie , and I think that this is important for this audience , that a year ago , before Russia decided , before President Putin decided to take the step that he took into Syria , that the situation was fundamentally different , there was potential there with some of us who are really pushing our Administration to do more , not just militarily , but change the entire economic system that exists in the Middle East and I can talk to that , if you d like . But when , suddenly , Russia shows up , so the stadium , the football stadium , if you will , of the Middle East , Russia put themselves on the field , and that fundamentally changed the dynamics of this very geostrategic game that we re in right now . It s not a game , this is very real . Tactically , what you have to remember is that this is an enemy that doesn t have jets and drones and missiles and all these ships , this is an enemy that gets attacked by bombs from the sky drones or jets , artillery and how do they counter attack ? They show up in downtown Paris , they show up in downtown Moscow , they show up in some place called San Bernardino that s how they counter attack . So , when we think about warfare , and we think about the battlefield , this is not just toe to toe in a place called Raqqa or in a place called Mosul or in Fallujah in Iraq and Syria . This is a global contest and the way this enemy has decided to retaliate , is they are retaliating by instilling fear this is a terror force , this is not a thug force , this is not a cult , this is not a criminal organisation . This is a terrorist organisation , based on a very radical form of Islamism .
