Social change needs subtleties . It needs room for negotiation , compromises , and shifting the debate . It also needs really boring things : tedious days of discussion and engagement , mind numbingly unsexy drafting of agreements , and an open mind at all stages . And it needs very invisible people committed to working away on these things through small , but important contributions . These are not people who buy action kits and re tweet . These are people who have just been told by the Invisible Children campaign that hanging a poster and wearing a bracelet is a better way to bring about social change , that the difficult political context in which they operate everyday , often at great personal risk and expense , can easily be solved if one man is removed .
