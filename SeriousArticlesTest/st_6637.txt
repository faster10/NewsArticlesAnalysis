China ' s legal system is heavily politicized . The Communist Party controls key appointments through a nontransparent process . Judges have no security of tenure and can be dismissed at any time . Courts must answer to local governments , who hold the purse strings and pay judges ' salaries . The court president , typically an official who hears no cases , can effectively dictate the decision in any case , whatever the judges who heard the case might think . And while there ' s no doubt that in many cases politicians don ' t interfere who has the time ? the system as a whole does not give courts and judges the resources to resist orders from senior politicians when they do come .
