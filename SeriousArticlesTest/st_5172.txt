We rely on judges to assist in dispensing justice , and to be the arbiter between the state and the defense . While the legislature has the absolute right to make laws , it should not hamstring a judge ' s ability to dispense appropriate justice under the specific circumstances of individual cases . When a judge faces a minimum mandatory sentence , her hands are tied , she becomes a mathematician rather than a dispenser of justice . If the facts and the law support a harsh sentence , a judge has the discretion to impose it , but we should not force their hands when minimum mandatories produce obviously unjust sentences .
