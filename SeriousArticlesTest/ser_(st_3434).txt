Gates and Zuckerberg constitute a massive improvement over the likes of the Kochs , whose interest in criminal justice reform only went as far as reducing sentences for white collar crime . And of course there s Donald Trump , who is using his money to treat the presidential race as a cross between Citizen Kane and The Great Dictator . The hacker philanthropists do seem to share something of a genuine utilitarian sensibility , and in the annals of the uber rich that speaks rather well of them . We should fear them less than their possible successors . The world coughs up a lot more Kochs than Zuckerbergs .
