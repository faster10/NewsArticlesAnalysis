I suppose this is the point where we ' re supposed to talk about Greg Hardy and how he factors into the Cowboys ' attempt to shut down the Panthers offense , but honestly , I don ' t want to talk about that guy . So let ' s pivot to this : do you think Josh Norman shadows Dez Bryant all over the field ? Ron Rivera stated that he will and Norman sounds pretty amped up about it . Consider , though , that Norman has only bumped down into the slot for six snaps the entire season , per Pro Football Focus , and the Cowboys unleashed Dez for a touchdown last week by finally moving him into the slot for a play after having him spend the entire afternoon split out wide to the left . If they want to get Dez away from Norman , why would they not send him to the slot and see who lines up against him ?
