Millennials are concerned with national debt and the deficits . The message that previous administrations ' reckless spending Republicans and Democrats alike has amounted to " generational theft " that is compromising the millennial generation ' s fiscal future can resonate . I had hoped that vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan would make it his mission to tour college campuses making an explicit generational appeal to millennials . This could be a winning issue for Republicans to help bridge the divide , and while Ryan did visit some universities , a consistent drumbeat by the Romney Ryan ticket to compete for the youth vote did not occur . It was a lost opportunity .
