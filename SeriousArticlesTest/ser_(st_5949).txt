According to Neutzling , in 2002 , while serving in South Korea , she was sexually assaulted by an intoxicated soldier she knew . She reported the assault to her commander , who gave the assailant a slap on the wrist punishment of five days of base restriction . Three years later in New Jersey , preparing for deployment to Iraq with a military police unit , she was again assaulted by a fellow soldier . Fearing nothing would happen if she reported the attack , Neutzling instead kept the incident to herself .
