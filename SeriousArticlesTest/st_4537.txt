Research shows that when CIT trained officers respond to a call , there are myriad benefits . The use of physical restraints goes way down , as do injuries to people in crisis and to officers . People are less likely to be arrested and taken to jail . And because officers know how to connect people to community services , the need to use the most expensive emergency services can sometimes be avoided . Equally valuable is the goodwill that CIT engenders . Officers report greater satisfaction in knowing how to help people , and citizens report greater trust in their police .
