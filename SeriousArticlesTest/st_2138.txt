These months aren t slow for the 56 year old Yost . He hunts most mornings and solves problems most afternoons . The problem on this day , two weeks before Yost reports to Surprise , Ariz . , for his third season as manager , is that raccoons have been eating the eggs of wild turkeys . In Yost s faraway world , this is a big deal . If there are no eggs , there are no turkeys , and if there are no turkeys , he and his friends cannot shoot them .
