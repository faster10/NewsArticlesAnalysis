Let ' s start with attacks on Bernie Sanders , who legitimately engaged his opponent Hillary Clinton in a debate about gun control . When Sanders said " all the shouting in the world " won ' t fix the country ' s gun violence problem , Clinton allies immediately labeled the comment as being sexist , saying that Sanders only used the word shouting because Clinton is a woman . Are you kidding me ? If Bernie Sanders who supported women ' s rights well before feminism became mainstream is a sexist , than I ' m not sure what the term even means .
