Despite the plaintiff ' s allegations and the judge ' s apparent concurrence , it makes no sense from either a research or therapeutic standpoint to pit adult stem cell against embryonic stem cell research . Think about the chaos that would be created if a heart researcher could file an injunction saying they were harmed and poorly funded because they are in competition with diabetes research . Giving artificial and unmerited research preference to one type of organs or cells over another would completely undermine the federal peer review process and funding strategy , and more important , would absolutely constrain ongoing searches for treatments and therapies .
