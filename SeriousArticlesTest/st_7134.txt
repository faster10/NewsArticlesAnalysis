Colorado ' s Family Planning Initiative provided funding for 68 family clinics across the state to offer around 30 , 000 intrauterine devices and implants to young women at low or no cost . An IUD is a small T shaped device that is inserted into the uterus by a doctor . They ' re either wrapped in copper or contain hormones , which kill sperm and make the uterine lining too thin for egg implantation . Because IUDs stay in place for five to 10 years , they ' re easier to comply with than taking daily birth control pills .
