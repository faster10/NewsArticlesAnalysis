In all we spent five days in Vancouver , two at the start of our trip and three at the end . We did a sightseeing tour the first day that took us to the Capilano Suspension Bridge as well as Stanley Park , Gastown , Granville Island Market and a few other ' must see ' spots . It was very touristy but gave us a quick overview of the city . We particularly loved the suspension bridge , which is 450ft long , 230ft high and wonderfully wobbly !
