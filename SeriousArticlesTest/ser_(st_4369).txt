While it is always a good idea to wash produce , a rinse doesn ' t always get rid of bacteria . In fact , you would have to scrub a vegetable for several minutes with antibacterial soap to kill the invisible offenders , Reyes said . " In the operating room , surgeons scrub for at least several minutes to make sure there ' s no bacteria on their skin , " she said . Food is the same way it would take a long time to actually make sure that no bacteria remains . The best solution is to just stay away from any foods , like tomatoes , that have been reported to be contaminated . You may be tempted to eat that piece of salami of indeterminate age sitting in your refrigerator . But if you do take a bite and it just doesn ' t taste right , Reyes has some advice for you : Stop eating .
