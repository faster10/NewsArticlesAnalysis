Jeremey : I would write down stuff on paper and then stick it on the drawers in the hotel so he knows where everything is . My dad , when he ' s packing , he just takes all the clothes and goes like this imitating his dad ' s voice , " Jeremey , help me throw in the clothes . " I try to fold them up and put them in . I ' m like , " Dad , you ' re not supposed to do that . "
