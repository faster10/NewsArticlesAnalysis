Yet all those dollar signs mean little if your heart s not in it . During Anti s gestation period , Rihanna admitted that being one of North America s most prolific divas was not longer fulfilling . I wanted songs that I could perform in 15 years , she told MTV last year of her vision for what eventually became Anti . I didn t want to perform a lot of my songs because they don t feel like me . So I want songs that are timeless . Now , after watching Anti s rollout turn into an absolute mess ? the false starts , the rumors , the scrapped singles , the album s early leak ? Rihanna seems determined to explain what took her so long on opening track Consideration : I got to do things my own way , darling , she cries in a thick patois . Will you ever let me ? Will you ever respect me ? No ! Why you will never let me grow ?
