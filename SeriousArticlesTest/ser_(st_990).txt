Then there ' s just the simplicity of Durant . For all the talk of Billy Donovan ' s offensive reform , system tweaks , ball movement and spacing , Durant has this thing he does where he breaks down the fourth wall and scores . Against the Brooklyn Nets last week , it was Durant dribbling up the floor after a rebound and canning a straightaway 3 to give the Thunder a fourth quarter lead . There were no passes on the possession , no play called . But it was three points in a big moment that only required the ball to touch No . 35 ' s hands somewhere in the gym .
