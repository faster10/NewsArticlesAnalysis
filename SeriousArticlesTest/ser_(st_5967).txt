The Panthers head coach , Ron Rivera , confirmed Davis had undergone surgery on his arm on Monday . He said he was going to play with the same type of sincerity he said to me when he told me he was coming back from the third ACL , Rivera said . There is something about his conviction and I think that s what makes him who he is today . So I have no doubt that as long as everything continues to heal the way it s supposed to , he ll be out there .
