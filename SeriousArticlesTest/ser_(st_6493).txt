Twenty four states have enacted density reporting legislation , beginning in my state of Connecticut in 2009 . The intent of the legislation is to give the consumer patient the facts about the impact of dense breast tissue on mammographic screening . A concluding statement in the JAMA guideline article states , " The ACS also recommends that women be provided with information about risk factors , risk reduction , and the benefits , limitations and harms associated with mammographic screening . " The potential harm of missed , delayed and advanced breast cancer , because of the masking of dense breast tissue , must be disclosed to women , regardless of what state she resides in or whether she is of average , intermediate or high risk of breast cancer .
