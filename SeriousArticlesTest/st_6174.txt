It turns out , there are things , like football and war , that even the biggest hater of government ? especially the biggest haters of government ? wouldn t want to ? outsource to private companies . But none of the candidates ? on Wednesday night reflected awareness of the absurd implications of their views . ? Fiorina and Kasich ? really , all of the GOP candidates ? claim to be ready to sell off every last bit of the public good . Let s hope they do it before Michigan s two best college teams face OSU in the coming weeks , and even better , before the government kills more Americans in another ill considered war .
