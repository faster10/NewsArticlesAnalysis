THE BIG PICTURE : This is the NFC East . With not one team above . 500 , all four are still somehow in the playoff hunt with four games left . With the Cowboys ( 4 8 ) win , they re only a game behind the Redskins ( 5 7 ) , Eagles ( 5 7 ) and Giants ( 5 7 ) but have a challenging schedule ahead that includes road trips to Green Bay and Buffalo , and home games against the Jets and Redskins . A Washington win would have solidified its spot atop the division and made it difficult for Dallas to stay alive . Now the division remains ? up for grabs .
