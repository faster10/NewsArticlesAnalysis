It has not been a vintage week for Djokovic . After confirming on Tuesday that he had rejected a 200 , 000 bribe to throw a match in Russia nine years ago , he was forced to deny match fixing allegations by an Italian newspaper the following night . He was further surprised to see his first name misspelled Novack on the revolving advertising carousel that rings Rod Laver Arena , and then , because of a technical cock up , his pre filmed contribution to Lleyton Hewitt on his farewell evening did not make the cut alongside Federer , Rafael Nadal , Andy Murray and Kyrgios .
