Oh , I m not going to engage with him on these matters . The voters can make up their minds , " she remarked . " I am going to continue to point out what his proposed policies would meant to our country and to hard working middle class families across our country . And he has been very dismissive about equal pay for equal work , about raising the minimum wage , which has two thirds of minimum wage workers being women , and some of the other , you know , changes and kinds of policies that he trumpets . So , I m going to let him answer for himself . I m not going to respond to his personal attacks , if that s what he wants to engage in . "
