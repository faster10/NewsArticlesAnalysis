The situations here have obviously different contexts ? Barnes supposedly drove to the home of his former wife to confront Fisher , while Griffin ' s situation appears to be more of a mutual argument that escalated too far ? but the league ' s reaction here will be interesting . The NBA does not typically get involved with locker room skirmishes , allowing teams to handle those situations internally . But the public nature of the incident combined with Griffin assaulting a staff member rather than another player may force the NBA ' s disciplinary hand . ?
