Peter Head : Fundamentally of course what we are talking about in terms of sustainability is long term thinking . So we are looking 20 or 30 years ahead and we are making sure that those cities will function economically with good prosperity in 20 or 30 years time when shortage of food and expensive food , and materials and water and so on maybe a greater problem . So it ' s very much looking at the jobs that one can bring in looking at the environmental performance and the way the city works and making sure that will still be working very well in the future .
