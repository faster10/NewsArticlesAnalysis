Making a ? Murderer lacks that sense of central storytelling , and as a result is ? neither quite as artful nor quite as comprehensively investigative as either The Jinx or Serial . Instead what comes through in the Netflix series is agenda the series took 10 years to make , as filmmakers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos were essentially embedded with the Avery clan from the 2006 trials and onward . Yet despite this range , the docuseries struggles to frame its chilling details into a strong sense of the big picture . For example , Manitowoc County s methods are clear , but its motives are vague , at best there are a few garbled threads about a vendetta against the Averys and digging in their heels about paying Steven Avery ? 36 million in restitution , but it never quite resolves beyond making the authorities ? cartoonishly evil . The 10 years working on the documentary does not appear to have offered the context of a decade , or further investigation on the case if Manitowoc County assumed , ridiculously , that Avery and Dassey were guilty right from the start , Making a ? Murderer sees no reason to look past their innocence .
