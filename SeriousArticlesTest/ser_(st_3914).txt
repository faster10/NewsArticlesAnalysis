1 . " Texas Gov . Rick Perry forgets his first name . " Who can forget ( except for maybe Rick Perry ) the November 9 presidential debate when Perry famously blanked when trying to remember the name of the third government agency he wanted to eliminate ? I wish Perry had done this more often forgetting dates , statistics , maybe even one of the names of the other presidential candidates during a debate , forcing him to cover with lines like : " I have to disagree with the guy who has been married a bunch of times and has a really weird first name . " ( Can you guess who I mean ? )
