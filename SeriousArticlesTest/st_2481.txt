A couple years back when I wound up back in Malibu , all by myself , with the same problems I had when I was 10 years old , I thought what the heck am I going to do with my life ? I had a lot of conversations with my family , my close friends , with my pastor , with God , and kind of came to a revelation , that maybe I should be honest with myself about who I am and let that person ? this woman who has lived inside me for my entire life ? finally have an opportunity to live .
