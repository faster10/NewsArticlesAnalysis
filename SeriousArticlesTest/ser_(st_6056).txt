The main reason for the limited use of the program is that Amber Alert cases must meet very specific criteria . Otherwise , the alerts will be issued too often , creating a " boy who cried wolf " scenario . People will become desensitized and stop taking the alerts seriously . After all , Department of Justice reports about 800 , 000 missing child cases any given year . Very few of those slightly more than 100 are stereotypical " kidnappings . " Over half of the 800 , 000 are kids who ran away , or simply lost track of time , or are part of custody disputes .
