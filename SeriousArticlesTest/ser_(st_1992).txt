This was going to start out as a diary for our girls so they ' d know how much we wanted them . It turned into a book because when I started telling people I was doing surrogacy I had so many friends call and e mail with questions . It got a little out of hand . Because the questions were all so similar I thought maybe I will write a book about this and it was such an easy process and even while writing the book I wondered , should I be doing this ? But in the end it turned out very powerful .
