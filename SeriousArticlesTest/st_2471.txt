0 . The captain utilizes a PC based flight simulator and deletes some files . So what ? My take : This is a hobby . The captain is passionate about flying . Did he fly only the 777 in the simulator ? He could well have flown other types of aircraft in the simulator , for his own purposes . Regardless , he wouldn ' t require this device to execute a nefarious plot . An 18 , 000 hour captain already has all the resources , i . e . charts and manuals , including his own experience .
