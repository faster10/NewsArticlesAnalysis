There is a connection between both speeches ? the politicians wrote much of themselves . Blair is a naturally gifted speaker and writer ? many of his best lines and passages were written by him in pencil on a yellow legal pad . Cameron is not in the same league , but he can rise to the occasion . When he read the civil service draft of the speech he was meant to make about Bloody Sunday he knew it wasn t good enough . So Cameron sat down and wrote his speech himself .
