I told Jason Mewes , just before we went onstage to do our " Jay Silent Bob Get Old " live podcast in London . He asked if he could be his own understudy . I haven ' t spoken to Brian O ' Halloran yet , but he ' s the only one of us with actual theatrical training , so this will be right up his alley . I know I ' ll need Trevor Fehrman as well , because Elias from " Clerks II " will feature prominently . Rosario Dawson ' s Becky would feature in a pre recorded bit .
