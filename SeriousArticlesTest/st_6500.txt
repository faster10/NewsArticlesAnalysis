Both teams measured the expansion rate using supernovae , which are stupendous explosions at the end of a star ' s fuel burning life . Astronomers know that a certain type of supernova always emits roughly the same amount of light , meaning it is a " standard candle " that can be used to indicate distance . Fainter supernovae would be farther away , and brighter ones would be closer . To make their measurements of supernovae , the teams used telescopes around the world and in space , most run by the National Science Foundation and NASA .
