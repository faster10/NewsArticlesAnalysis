Despite 25 years of friendship , Inhofe doesn ? ? ? t know much about Sanders personally . ? ? ? With everyone else in the Senate , they ? ? ? ll discuss the Oklahoma Oklahoma State game , ? ? ? Inhofe says . ? ? ? But not Bernie . I don ? ? ? t think he has any other interests . I really don ? ? ? t . I ? ? ? ve never heard him talk about anything besides something legislative he ? ? ? s all wrapped up in . It ? ? ? s very unusual . ? ? ? Inhofe pauses . ? ? ? I , to this day , don ? ? ? t even know if he has grandkids . Or even a wife . ? ? ? The two have never gone to dinner or lunch . ? ? ? I don ? ? ? t know what we ? ? ? d talk about , ? ? ? Inhofe says , before remembering that , of course , Sanders would talk about wealth inequality . ? ? ? You can ? ? ? t have a whole dinner talking about that . ? ? ?
