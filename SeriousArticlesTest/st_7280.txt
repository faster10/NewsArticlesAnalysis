The discussion we need to have must start with what we know about refugees from war torn regions . Homeless and hungry , some are injured and most lack basic possessions . There is a vetting process for them and it ' s a pretty good one , with enough levels that it takes an average of 18 to 24 months for clearance . No Syrian who has come here has ever been charged with crimes of terrorism . Since 9 11 , the system has been tweaked , but nothing will be foolproof . But that doesn ' t mean it can ' t get better . The Islamic State is a different kind of threat . Vetting should evolve as well .
