Using this model , to win you need these folks ( those who have voted in the last state caucus or primary ) to show up . It s not an easy task unless you have helpers to either get them to the polls or make sure that they did vote for your candidate . Referred to as the ground game , this method was perfected by Democrats , who wrote the book on this tried and proven process for winning a caucus , primaries and elections . All of this may have changed , thanks to Donald Trump .
