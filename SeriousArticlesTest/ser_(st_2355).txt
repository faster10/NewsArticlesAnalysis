Mr Sanders now represents for Socialists what Michael Sam , the first openly gay NFL player , represented for the homosexual rights movement ? legitimacy . His Simon and Garfunkel America all court press has freed Socialists from the shadows . Their stigma is gone . And that ? not the poll numbers , or the day to day politicking , or the he said , she said arguments , but rather the sad disappearance of America s noble republic , complete with principles of limited government as based on God given rights ? is the big story , the media missed picture . Giving Mr Sanders such a large platform is a startling commentary on the state of U . S . politics and culture . Watching his Socialist race be greeted with such favor is a pitiful discovery that speaks volumes about the country s demise .
