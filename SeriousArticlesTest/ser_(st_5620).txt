Renner is entitled to cash in on his " Hurt Locker " acclaim and make a living like anybody else , but I ' ll bet he was more animated cashing his check than he is as a gun toting medieval witch slayer , the little boy from Grimm ' s fairytale grown up with a chip on his shoulder and an inexplicable American accent ( which is shared by his " sis , " Gemma Arterton ' s leather clad Gretel , but no one else in this neck of the woods ) .
