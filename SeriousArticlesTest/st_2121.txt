Morgenstern : I ' m going to be very busy with the book ' s release but when I have time I am working on a new book . It ' s very different but I ' m looking forward to exploring someplace new . I need to live in the world of story for awhile before I figure out the shape of the book . It ' s sort of a film noir with influences from " Alice in Wonderland , " so it has a sort of fantastic feel , like the magic of " The Night Circus " but with a little more ' 30s , ' 40s , ' 50s art deco feel to the story .
