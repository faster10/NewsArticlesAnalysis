If cities as large as Philadelphia and Houston and rural communities such as New River Valley in Virginia and Cambria County , Pennsylvania , can institute CIT , why aren ' t there teams in every community ? Of course , it costs money to pull officers off the street , to train police dispatchers , to pay for materials and for costs associated with using community buildings . Grants from government entities and foundations can at times help to offset these costs . And much of the training is done by volunteers .
