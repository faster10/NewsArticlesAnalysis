That ' s just the beginning of the story . The real struggle here is the nearly five months the crash survivors spent stranded on the ice , battling blizzards and sub zero temperatures . Adding to the narrative , there ' s also a connection to the present woven into the harrowing WWII tale . Nearly 70 years after the crash , Zuckoff , members of the U . S . Coast Guard and a group of polar explorers go back to Greenland looking for one of the original crash sites and a plane still believed to be buried under the ice . In both time periods , this is a truly suspenseful and thrilling American story of perseverance with a worthwhile payoff in the final pages .
