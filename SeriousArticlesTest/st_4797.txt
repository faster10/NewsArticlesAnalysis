No , I mean , I m the quarterback of this team , he said . I fought my way back to play out here . I didn t want to be coming out of that game . I think those guys that were playing out there deserve from me to finish that game . We ve put a lot of work in this year and as bad as it was going , I wasn t going to come out of that game . A lot of guys had put a lot of work in , and for me to cop out I think would show lack of being a man and lack of leadership .
