Eight Egyptians involved in a botched repair of the famed golden burial mask of King Tut , which was corrected late last year , have been referred to trial for " gross negligence . " Prosecutors said in a Sunday statement that the 3 , 300 year old mask , whose beard was accidentally knocked off and hastily glued on with epoxy in 2014 , was scratched and damaged as a result . The mask was put back on display last month after a German Egyptian team of specialists removed the epoxy and reattached the beard using beeswax , which is often used as an adhesive for antiquities .
