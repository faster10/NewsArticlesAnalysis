After Adam Gase was hired by the Miami Dolphins , Jackson quickly became a top target for many teams , including the New York Giants , who were preparing to meet with Jackson as early as today . He had previously interviewed with the San Francisco 49ers and had an interview scheduled with Miami before the team hired Gase . He will be the eighth coach in Cleveland since the Browns returned in 1999 , and the sixth since 2008 .
