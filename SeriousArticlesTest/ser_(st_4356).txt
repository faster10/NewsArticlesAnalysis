Last week , we talked about the improvement for C . J . Anderson , and he once again played better than Hillman against the Patriots with 16 carries for 72 yards and three catches for 18 yards . Why the two players continue to share carries is beyond me or anyone else who has watched the Broncos play down the stretch , but coach Gary Kubiak still wants both of his running backs involved on an even basis . Hillman struggled against the Steelers in the Divisional Round with 16 carries for 38 yards and no catches , and he has one game with more than 50 rushing yards in his past six games overall . He ' s a free agent this offseason , and we hope the Broncos let him walk to give Anderson more of a featured role . He ' ll likely get more work than needed if he remains in Denver based on how Kubiak seems to like him , which would hurt Anderson ' s outlook . Hillman is a capable backup , and he should be good as a spot starter , which he proved this season when he had six games with double digits in Fantasy points in a standard league in his first 11 games when Anderson was hurt and struggling . We ' ll see where Hillman ends up in 2016 , but he should not be getting as much work as the Broncos continue to give him , especially at the expense of Anderson .
