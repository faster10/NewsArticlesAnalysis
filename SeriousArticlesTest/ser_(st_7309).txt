Seniors should spin Wheel of Fortune : I really enjoy watching the " Wheel of Fortune , " but I wonder why they never have senior citizens on the program . It ' s either young or middle aged folks . Do they think seniors aren ' t smart enough to be on the program or that seniors don ' t need a little extra cash ? Aren ' t our lives interesting enough to be on television ? Aren ' t we vivacious enough to make the program interesting ? You might be surprised at a senior ' s abilities .
