Deep down , you want to believe it s a terrible idea . Few farewells have been as perfect as LCD Soundsystem s three hour sign off to nearly 20 , 000 fans at Madison Square Garden in 2011 . The Long Goodbye became a five disc box set , an in store exhibition , and a feature length documentary screened to fans who danced in the cinema aisles . And it was a statement that secured the band s righteous place in pop mythology , proving that even in LCD s short life , they showed the rest of the music industry how it was done : drop the mic , exit stage left and never look back .
