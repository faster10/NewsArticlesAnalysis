The opportunity to speak to a joint meeting of Congress is an honor that is reserved for heads of state of our closest allies . I will be in the House chamber when Prime Minister Abe delivers his address . Ms . Lee will attend as my guest . Both of us hope the Prime Minister will take the privilege of this opportunity and finally , and firmly , apologize , and commit to educating the future generation honestly and humbly . Ms . Lee and her sisters deserve no less .
