The highest ranking hockey player on the list is Jaromir Jagr at 5 1 , although that doesn ' t seem like a great bet . Just last week , Jagr told SportsNet Canada , If I can play till I die , that ' s what I will do . What else are you gonna do ? Even if you retire , you still will have to go work out , and maybe harder than you do when you play hockey because you don ' t wanna look ugly and fat . At least I don ' t want to . "
