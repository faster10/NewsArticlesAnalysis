But if there were ever a game to call off the dogs and try to drop back into coverage , this would seem to be the one . Drastic shifts in style have flummoxed the Patriots in the past think back to the 2010 playoffs , when the Jets traveled to Foxborough just six weeks after being blown out 45 3 . Despite the fact that it was the playoffs , Rex Ryan zigged when the Patriots expected him to zag . After consulting with his players , Ryan scrapped his usual Darrelle Revis led man to man coverage and showed Brady mostly zone looks . The Patriots star was sacked five times in a confusing , frustrating game , and the Jets eventually pulled the upset 28 21 . It gave Mark Sanchez a playoff road win over Brady , which is something future generations will struggle to understand .
