Furst : Let me put it this way , I don ' t plan to retire . What would I do , become a brain surgeon ? I mean a brain surgeon can retire and write novels , but a novelist can ' t retire and do brain surgery or at least he better not . I wouldn ' t know what to do with myself . I ' m a writer . I live it and breathe it . God made me this way it ' s not my fault ! I don ' t complain too much . Really , I feel very privileged to live the way I do and make a living as I have . Not everybody can do that .
