We are 30 years into this epidemic . How will we reflect upon the next 30 years ? Will we say that we halted this disease from eliminating an entire generation in Africa ? Will we remind ourselves of how the subcontinent of India was brought to the brink of disaster , only to be diverted by a worldwide effort to prevent and treat infections ? Or will the already devastated inner city neighborhoods and poor rural communities across the United States sink into greater despair ? Will we bear the guilt for so many lost lives that could have been saved ? In our opinion , both missions must be addressed , not one at the expense of the other .
