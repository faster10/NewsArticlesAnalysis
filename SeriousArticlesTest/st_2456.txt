Back then , it was hard not to imagine that by 2012 we would have a permanent multinational lunar base from which ships with people would be traveling every other month to Mars and from there , maybe , to one of Jupiter ' s potentially habitable moons . We can see those things better than we once did , thanks to things like the Hubble Space Telescope , which wouldn ' t be working now unless people went up in shuttles for repairs and maintenance . But we ' re nowhere near being ready or , worse , willing to go there ourselves .
