Certainly , his lack of quality receivers has hurt him , and Rodgers is always a dangerous force , but this is not the Aaron Rodgers of old . . . or even the Aaron Rodgers of earlier this year .

With just over two minutes left , Rodgers also threw a season crushing interception in the end zone to Xavier Rhodes , ending the last hope of Packers fans .
