The late , great columnist Murray Kempton once said the job of daily newspaper editorial writers was to come down from the hills after the battle is over , and shoot the wounded . I was thinking of Kempton today , as both the Washington Post and New York Times editorial pages took aim at Donald Trump , who has exuded blood curdling rhetoric from wherever the past few days . The Times said he was a racist . No kidding . The Post , more helpfully , suggested that it was time for Trump s fellow Republicans to criticize him for his gleefully effective efforts to cultivate America s low information voters .
