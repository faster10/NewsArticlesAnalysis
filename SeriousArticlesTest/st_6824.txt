" I personally love the moments when I get to wear the ' 70s clothes , " said Lawrence , who ( really ) plays Mystique . " I really enjoy them because I love that time and I like wearing clothes when I can . Some of the Mystique stuff , some of the look is a little bit different . We ' re still using the same paint . When we left the ( last ) movie , she was mutant and proud . She was kind of struggling with the problem that a lot of normal human people struggle with , which is how they look . So she was very covered up in the first movie , but this time she is mutant and proud . "
