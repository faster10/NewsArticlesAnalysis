Daraz claims that his film inspired thousands of Arab youth to join bin Laden ' s small group of fighters . " Bin Laden ' s office manager in Jeddah , Saudi Arabia , informed me that millions of Saudi Riyals were donated by people and organizations supporting the movement after the release of my film , " said Daraz . Around 1988 al Qaeda was established and Daraz met Ayman Al Zawahiri , also known on the field as Dr Abdel Moez or bin Laden ' s personal adviser and physician . " I watched him personally monitor bin Laden ' s consistent low blood pressure and give him the required medicine many times on the battlefield , " said Daraz .
