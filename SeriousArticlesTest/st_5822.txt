Political action by Britain is , in any case , constrained by the US , which does not want Isis , President Bashar al Assad or the forces headed by the al Qaeda affiliate , the al Nusra Front , to win the Syrian civil war decisively . Washington is trying to pretend that there is a moderate Syrian constituency opposed to these three parties capable of taking power in Damascus . David Cameron similarly expresses belief that not only does such a moderate force exist , but that it numbers 70 , 000 fighters , many of them members of the Free Syrian Army , an institution that was always an umbrella group and largely disintegrated two years ago . ?
