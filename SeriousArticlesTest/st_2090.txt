I just don t trust her , said Jason Frerichs , the Democratic Party leader in Montgomery County , Iowa . I m a progressive that s my value , and that s what I want . I don t need an ideological purity test , I just don t trust her . She s pivoted on too many issues important to me . I m 38 and earn 45 , 000 a year . How can she understand what my life is like ? She s a millionaire . She s a career politician . I just don t see much excitement for her outside the baby boomers , who think it s her time .
