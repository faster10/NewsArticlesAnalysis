London The Dutch royal family , also known as the House of Orange Nassau , is symbolic of this nation ' s fiercely independent spirit . The Netherlands is small geographically but during its " golden age " in the 17th century it had what historian Simon Schama called " an embarrassment of riches . " Over the centuries it has experienced much religious strife , acquired and lost an empire and is now governed by a series of coalitions . The monarchy is a proud symbol of national unity .
