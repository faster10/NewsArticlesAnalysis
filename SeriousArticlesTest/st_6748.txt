I ' ll have more to say about the Fed later , but at this point , were they not to raise , it would be downright weird , odd , and inconsistent with forward guidance ( telegraphing their important punches ) . Even while I do not see much rationale for an increase , especially given elevated underemployment and the stark lack of inflationary pressures , given their recent messaging , a non liftoff in December would suggest the economy is a lot worse than they thought in some secret way they ' ve been keeping from us . Such a negative surprise would be ill advised .
