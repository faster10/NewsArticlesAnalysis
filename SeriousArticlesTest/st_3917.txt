But why are citizens protesting now ? Well , the government wants to re open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3 , 700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of Naples and surrounding areas .

As a result , many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity in some cases just a few yards away from the site .
