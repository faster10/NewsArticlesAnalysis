Grammer : It ' s confusing . What ' s interesting about Tom is that when he ' s in a caring moment , it ' s real , it ' s full , it ' s rich . You spot the humanity that ' s within this monster . You start to feel sorry for the monster , which is typical of a great horror movie villain . You discover this humanity in him and you long for it in a weird way . But when he cares , he really cares . He ' s not phony . But then it becomes more confusing . It ' s just a great thing to get to play . He ' s so disabled by his own choices .
