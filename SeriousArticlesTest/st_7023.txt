I wouldn ' t be surprised if he talks about poverty and climate change . I ' ve been going to East Africa regularly for the past seven years and really see the impact of climate change on subsistence farmers . They rely heavily on the seasons , the wet and dry seasons , to produce crops . I often ask farmers about the seasons and I ' m always told , it used to be that the rains would come at the same time each year , but now we don ' t know anymore .
