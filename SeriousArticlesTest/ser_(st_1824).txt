We started off in Vancouver , which is a fabulous city . It ' s easy to see why it ' s considered one of the top five places in the world to live . Surrounded by beaches , ocean , mountains and greenery , it reminded us of Cape Town . We stayed in English Bay , near the beach and right beside Vancouver ' s famous Stanley Park . It ' s a stunning place , with nearly 1 , 000 acres of west coast rainforest , a smattering of manicured lawns , beautiful gardens , sports fields , an outdoor pool and a six mile sea wall .
