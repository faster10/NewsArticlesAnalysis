The sleeper of great US roads , US 83 is anything but a snooze , especially if you want hundreds of miles of driving through wide open spaces , often little changed since the last Conestoga wagon passed through . From Manitoba to Mexico , the route runs near arrow straight south through North and South Dakota , Nebraska , Kansas and Oklahoma . The skies are big , the vistas wide and the small towns offer respite from chain filled Interstate interchanges . In Texas , the beautiful Hill Country is a highlight before the road hits the troubled yet fascinating Mexican border at Laredo and follows the Rio Grande River to Brownsville .
