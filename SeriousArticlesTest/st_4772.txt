My fourth , final and most vital piece of advice would be that after you have ensured your love for your white colleges , make sure you still have room left to love yourself . Don ' t forget to love yourself when you courageously sit down at the table in the student union eager to make new friends , and the girl at the table immediately gets up and says , " Kelly , can you make sure to watch my things ? " Don ' t forget to love yourself when you enthusiastically show up to the dining hall to meet your new friend ' s parents only to be greeted with a , " Oh do you work here ? " Don ' t forget who you are despite your professor always confusing you with the only other black kid in your class . Don ' t forget to love yourself when you feel alone , unwelcome and unwanted .
