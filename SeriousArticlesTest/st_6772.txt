That said , Bautista made an ill advised throw on Eric Hosmer ' s single in the eighth inning , allowing Lorenzo Cain to score what proved to be the game winning run all the way from first . Hosmer ripped a single to right , Bautista ran it down , spun around and threw blindly towards second base , and Cain took advantage . Bautista didn ' t necessarily miss the cutoff man , he threw to the wrong base entirely . He ' s got to get the ball to the cutoff man near first base for the best chance to get Cain at the plate . His throw went to the second base bag and that opened the door for Cain to score . The play at the plate wasn ' t even close .
