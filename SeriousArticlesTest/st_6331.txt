The thing is , I believe Trump could be talked out of any of these positions because he has changed his mind many times before ( that is why he is probably less scary as a possible president than Carson , a man convinced that God tells him what to think ) . Trump is just winging it coming up with answers to questions without really taking much time to think . He has no policies , no detailed plans , he just has impulses and notions and illusions about how tough guys act . Obviously , there are millions of Americans who analyze the world in the same way . It is no surprise that they like Trump because , other than his billions of dollars , he is a guy just like them .
