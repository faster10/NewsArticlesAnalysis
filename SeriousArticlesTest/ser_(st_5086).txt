Obama won a 5 million vote margin of victory in 2012 with the same share of the white vote , 39 percent , that condemned Michael Dukakis to defeat in 1988 . The 2012 electorate was 72 percent white in 2016 it will be closer to 70 percent . ( Rubio pollster White Ayres predicts it will be 69 percent . ) Clinton can fall short of Obama ' s share of black or Hispanic votes and still win the presidency . If she falls a bit short on both and right now there ' s no particular reason to believe she will and yet does better than Obama with white women , which seems eminently plausible , she can replicate or exceed Obama ' s victory .
