As a five time champion at Melbourne Park , Djokovic has long been a fan favourite here , even if Federer remains supreme in that department . But if there is one thing we know about Djokovic , it is that he does not like it when the crowd gets on his back . He has become better at coping but , quite understandably , he still finds it hard to understand why they might want his opponent to win and occasionally he can let it rattle him . Murray needs to find a way to get the crowd on his side early on , either by his own play or by being gutsy . Australians love winners but they also love an underdog and a trier so having lost in four previous finals , they will not need much encouragement to back him in this one .
