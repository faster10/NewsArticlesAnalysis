Pentobarbital has become the new legal flashpoint over capital punishment . It was used in a U . S . execution for the first time in December 2010 , when it was administered as the first ingredient in a three drug cocktail used in a lethal injection given to an Oklahoma inmate . It also has limited Food and Drug Administration approval in smaller doses for humans as a mild anesthetic and to treat some seizures . Many physicians say they no longer administer it to people for medical purposes .
