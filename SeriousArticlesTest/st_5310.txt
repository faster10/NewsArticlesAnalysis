Why do we do this to ourselves ? Why do we persist in propping up this peculiar tradition through hate watching , feigned outrage , smarm , and incessant armchair quarterbacking the day after ? Awards shows are essentially sporting events without the tantalising , illicit violence ? contests with no bearing on society other than the significance we place on them as helpless observers . The Revenant wins and we all try to make it a referendum on the state of cinema . Call me an unrepentant nihilist if you will , but if I m not nominated for an award , I don t care who wins .
