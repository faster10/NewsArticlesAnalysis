There have been reports of irregularities , intimidation and people being left off official voter lists , but , at this polling station , we saw no problems , with officials calmly explaining the procedure for filling out ballot papers and placing them in the sealed boxes . Here voting took place in a temporary marquee erected between run down old apartment blocks . Several young men helped lift an older man in his wheelchair inside to vote . Everyone we spoke to expressed their happiness about this historic moment , and their hope that it would help make theirs a better country . ?
