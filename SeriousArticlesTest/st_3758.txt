' One day cricket is really significant for me , ' said Anderson as he prepares to go to Australia for the triangular series that precedes the World Cup . ' I made my England debut in one day cricket and I ' ve always enjoyed that form . I ' ve still got a drive to play one day cricket so until that stops I will carry on . My record in 50 over games is probably better than Tests if you look at the stats . It will be great to have these months of one day cricket . '
