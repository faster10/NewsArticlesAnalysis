But Rubio is also a smart politician . He senses that the conventional description of the Republican contest is both wrong and not helpful to him . Rubio is typically cast as running in an " establishment lane " with Jeb Bush , John Kasich and Chris Christie . Trump is a lane unto himself , and Ted Cruz has largely been ceded his own lane on the right as potential competitors have fallen back ( Mike Huckabee , Rick Santorum ) or withdrawn ( Bobby Jindal , Rick Perry ) .
