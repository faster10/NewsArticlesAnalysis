The current plan calls for the remains to be housed in an underground repository , behind a wall in the museum , and adjacent to a memorial gallery filled with pictures and artifacts of the victims . The museum , which is under construction , is located beneath the footprints of the two World Trade Center towers . The repository will be controlled by the medical examiner ' s office , which will continue to have access to the remains in the hope that , as DNA technology progresses , more positive identifications can be made .
