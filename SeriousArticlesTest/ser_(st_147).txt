You can read up on P26 on this blog from the Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program . P26 is so terribly shy that when researchers released him he just sat there in a box for hours , unsure of where to go or what to do . He burrowed beneath one tree , then another , with researchers following his moves with a radio tracking device attached to his tail ( you can see it in the image above ) . At one point , he moved so little that it sounds like the researchers or at least some blog readers doubted that he was alive .
