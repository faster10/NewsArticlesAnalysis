Sure Alper we can be all sweet and diplomatic about it by saying that if a multitude of other things happened then things would have been different . Well I mean of course . You can say that about every situation in life . Fact is Jeremy Hill had one job . THAT S what the game pretty much came down to . Bengals had the game won . Then they lose in the most Bengaliest way possible . Now you have possibly a hurt Roethlisberger who may not be able to throw further than 15 yards and perhaps a jacked up Antonio Brown going in to Denver which won t be a competitive game anyway if that s the case . Between the injured steelers , injured patriots , bengals with mccarron , the horrible Texans that everyone was subjected to , an already pedestrian Chiefs offense now without Maclin and Charles . The AFC makes me want to throw up . And the NFL frankly isn t that much better with ano average at best Minnesota with an awful quarterback , the Packers are awful , and a 9 7 team winning an awful NFL East . Honestly why hasn t anyone written about just how terrible of a year this has been for football ? Mediocrity across the board .
