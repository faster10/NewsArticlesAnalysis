Mazzara : Part of what I hope to do this season is really focus on the character of Rick and his questions of leadership . Taking over a successful show , I ' m facing my own questions of leadership , so that ' s easy to write . But I feel that the work I ' ve done in the past , especially on " The Shield , " where it was a very surprising , violent show , yet grounded work that ' s something I ' m trying to bring to this piece as well .
