Only a week ago , I paid a fleeting visit to Key West , Florida , where it was almost 90 under the palm trees . Coming back to Vermont late one night , only a few days ago , I stepped from the airplane into the dark , icy weather , and I wondered how I could stand it . When I got to my car , the thermometer on my dashboard told me it was 10 below zero . And the wind howled as I drove through the dark snowy mountains to my house . Was I crazy to live in such a climate ?
