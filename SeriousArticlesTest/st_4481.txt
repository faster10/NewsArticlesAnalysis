On Sunday in the NFC Championship against the visiting Arizona Cardinals , the Carolina defense brought more of the same . The Panthers limited Carson Palmer and the Arizona offense which finished the regular season second in the league in scoring to just 287 yards and 15 points , well below their season averages . And even those totals are a bit inflated : more than half ( 8 ) of those points came after the game was already in hand , with the Panthers having gone up by 34 7 at one point .
