This doesn ' t just apply to Michael Vick . Look at all the individuals who are sent to prison , get out and then can ' t find a job . Why ? Because they have the Scarlet Letter on their record , which is a big fat " F " for felon . Don ' t think I ' m looking for any sympathy for someone who goes to jail . I firmly believe that you deserve all that you get for breaking the law . But listening to some of these zealots go on and on and on about Vick needing to continue to be punished is ridiculous !
