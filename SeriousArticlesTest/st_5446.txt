Saudi Arabia ' s geopolitical weight makes it a key player in stabilizing regional crises . However , the country ' s recent actions , like the beheading of Shiite cleric Ayatollah Nimr al Nimr , have made it a destabilizing force . This action demonstrated the use of sectarian division ( the anti Shia , anti Iran card ) to rally short term support among Sunnis in both the Saudi kingdom and elsewhere in the region , around what has been presented as a Shiite threat . This barbaric execution will have the inevitable effect of adding fuel to the fire and provoking large numbers of Shiites in the region .
