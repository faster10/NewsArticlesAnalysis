I have friends who are famous , and friends that are not famous but there are those who stick out to me . Willie Nelson is one a really genuine person or Neil Young . Adam Sandler . . . people who really try and keep a sense of unity , and camaraderie and equality around them . That ' s essential . That ' s it for me . I don ' t think socialism , and I don ' t think warmness and respect are necessarily bad words .
