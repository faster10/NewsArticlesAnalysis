It s hard to credit this as a coincidence . Not from Bowie , who seemed to have seen , heard , read , and remembered everything ( except perhaps a lot of his nights in the mid 70s ) . And so , as gauche as it can seem to seek them , sometimes there are hidden messages . In this case , it s the Queen Bitch delivering a deathbed lip smack to the King , across the universe of pop and beyond ? and complementarily , no doubt , to whomever might rise next to usurp Bowie s worldly berth .
