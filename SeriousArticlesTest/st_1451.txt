If you are as great as Khan , what about politics ? I would suggest : Set up a political party , like Imran Khan , and call for an end to corruption while looking deferentially in the direction of Hafiz Saeed and that other humanitarian saint , Dawood Ibrahim . The only hitch I can see in Shah Rukh is that he is too soft spoken . That will not do . He will have to thunder defamations like Imran if he wants to get in the good books of the masses .
