CLINTON AND SANDERS OPEN UP ABOUT SPIRITUALITY . It wasn t an official debate , but it was close . Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton took the stage separately Wednesday night in a " presidential town hall " forum on CNN . Moderator Anderson Cooper and New Hampshire voters peppered them with questions ranging from the political to the personal . Each candidate got an hour to themselves , dedicating much of their time to outlining their respective visions ? but neither shied away from taking swipes at their rival backstage . ABC s LIZ KREUTZ , BRAD MIELKE and MARYALICE PARKS are the moments that stood out . http : abcn . ws 1nI3EhX
