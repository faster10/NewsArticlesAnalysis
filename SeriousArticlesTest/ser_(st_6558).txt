Matthews : I want to figure out a way to not be stupid with money , then make a whole bunch of it , then I want to move to Outer Mongolia . I want to milk a yak . Maybe I ' ll just settle for a cow . Can you milk a bison ? I have fantasies about being a farmer . I always wanted to be a fireman , but who didn ' t want to be a fireman ? I just wouldn ' t tell anyone . I ' d just go " poof ! " Sometimes I like that idea .
