Irish golfer Christy O ' Connor Jr . ' s unexpected death this week at age 67 brought back European Ryder Cup memories of his 2 iron to the 18th green in 1989 that O ' Connor described as " the shot of my life . ' ' The 17 time tour winner was a 1 up upset winner over American Fred Couples , who missed the green with a 9 iron at the home hole after watching O ' Connor ' s shot from 220 yards come to rest just 4 feet from the pin . When Couples chipped on and missed his par putt , he conceded O ' Connor ' s birdie .
