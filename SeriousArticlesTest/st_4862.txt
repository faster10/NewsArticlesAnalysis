Now , look , I ' m probably more favorably disposed to Republican tax priorities than most journalists . I think the government should be smaller and do less , and therefore cost less . I am a weak supply sider : I do not think that tax cuts pay for themselves , but I think that taxes do suppress economic growth somewhat , one reason lower taxes are better . I have long pounded the drum about tax simplification . But as a rule , I endorse the old Daniel Davies maxim : " Good ideas do not need lots of lies told about them in order to gain public acceptance . "
