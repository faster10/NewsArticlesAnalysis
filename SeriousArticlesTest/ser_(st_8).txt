The question now ? unasked and unanswered ? is whether the recent evidence of global reach by ISIS requires a change in US NATO strategy . France will probably invoke Article V of the NATO treaty , which calls on the members to join together in a military response to the act of war . What does that mean ? Does it mean ? as most Republicans have suggested ? that we are at turning point : that an allied invasion force is necessary to retake the territory held by ISIS Da esh ?
