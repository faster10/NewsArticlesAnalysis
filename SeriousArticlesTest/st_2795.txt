The same model had previously computed the costs of climate change at 400 trillion by 2200 . Adding a decade long rush of methane to the atmosphere would boost that by 60 trillion , mostly between 2050 and 2075 , said Chris Hope , a modeling expert at Cambridge ' s Judge Business School . Even a slower release , dampened by other cuts in emissions , could cost 37 trillion a figure that dwarfs the 100 billion that Lloyds of London estimates will be invested in the Arctic over the next decade .
