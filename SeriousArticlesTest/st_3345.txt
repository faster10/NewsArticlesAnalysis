In the end , though , the Cavs should try to protect James from himself . Maybe James isn ' t comfortable with the idea of playing 31 minutes a game , but could be talked into it .

As ESPN ' s Tom Haberstroh explained recently , the 30 year old James has played more minutes than anyone else at his age in NBA history . It might be time to learn how to pace himself .
