Tena : We skinned a rabbit . . . . ( A forest ranger ) just plunked a rabbit in front of me and Ellie ( Kendrick , who plays Meera Reed ) and he showed us how to do it . And , it was fine . But when we did it on the day , after skinning 40 rabbits and pulling their heads off . . . all of it congealed . It was a hot day and by the end of the day , I had flies all over my hands . I did go a bit mad . I had , like , three showers . Everyone thinks fish smell and you don ' t really think about meat . Meat , by the end of the day , is horrible . I felt like Lady Macbeth . I was , like , " Out , damn spot ! " Pulling their heads off as well that was pretty interesting . We ran out of rabbits , so sometimes we had to kind of plunk bits of the bodies back together . It was a special day .
