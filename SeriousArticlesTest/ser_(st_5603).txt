For decades , the NRA has won key elections by motivating gun owners to show up at the polls . After the Brady Bill was passed by President Bill Clinton banning assault weapons and requiring federal background checks , the Democrats lost the House of Representatives in 1994 . In 2000 , Bill Clinton blamed Al Gore s general election loss on the NRA and gun lobbies , saying they probably had more to do than anyone else in the fact we didn t win the House this time , and they hurt Al Gore .
