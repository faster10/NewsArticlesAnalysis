" It ' s pure mathematics , " says Putin ' s spokesperson Dimitri Peskov . " Yes we have something like 70 , 000 people out there protesting on Sakharov Avenue but at the same time we have to keep in mind they are a minority . The majority of the population does not live here in Moscow . We have a huge country and if we look eastwards we ' ll see lots and lots of big cities , small towns and rural populations that still support Putin pretty well . "
