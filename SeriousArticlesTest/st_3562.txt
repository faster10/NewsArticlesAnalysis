Miss You Already ( PG 13 ) When Miss You Already works , it s because of the cast . ( Toni ) Collette , who shaved her head for the part , commits so deeply to the role of Milly that it s hard to hate the contrivance of the plot . For her part , ( Drew ) Barrymore shines like a bright beacon through the dark night of the soul that falls ? if only temporarily ? over the friendship of Milly and Jess . ? Michael O Sullivan
