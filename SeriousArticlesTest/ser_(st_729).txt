The timing of the execution of Shaikh al Nimr was well planned . It was a deliberate provocation by Saudi Arabia with the aim of strengthening hardliners in Iran . There should be no doubt that Saudi policymakers calculate that an Iran under a pro west , moderate leadership is the biggest threat to its interests . A hardline anti west Iran is Saudi Arabia s best bet in retaining regional significance . Shaikh al Nimr s death , therefore , was calculated to weaken the moderates in Iran . The parliamentary elections in Iran on February 26 , 2016 are crucial elections and may well determine the future of an Iran deal . From all reports it seems that the moderates are losing ground in these elections . The hardliners are capitalising on the hysteria that has been created as a result of growing sectarian tensions .
