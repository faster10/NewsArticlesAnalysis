Stay connected to home . It was a surprise to me that at 11 and 12 , Savannah and Camron each had a real adjustment to make being away from home , without parents or siblings to look to . Vannah brought along a framed picture of her parents , which helped her feel more secure . My cell phone served as a lifeline for both children , as well as for Mommy , who was suffering a little separation anxiety herself . Each day the children grew in their independence , and the phone calls got fewer and shorter as our time together stretched on .
