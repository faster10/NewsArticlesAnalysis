One thing I would like to see is more Kobe with the second unit , and by extension less with Russell and Randle . Kobe s going to take his shots , but if he is taking those away from Nick Young or Lou Williams , so what ? Let those guys fight over the ball a little ( that would be entertaining ) . But then rest him and let Russell and Randle and the other youth learn to work together for long stretches without any of those ball dominating players on the court . That includes letting the kids close some games , even if it s not pretty .
