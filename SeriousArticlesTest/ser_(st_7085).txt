In second was " Beauty and the Beast 3D " with 18 . 5 million for the three day frame the largest January opening for an animated film ( topping 2006 s " Hoodwinked " ) . Disney spent less than 10 million converting the 1991 classic to 3 D , so this kind of opening more than justifies the studio ' s decision to re release the musical . It also bodes well for Disney ' s future 3 D re releases : " Finding Nemo " in September , and " Monsters , Inc . " and " The Little Mermaid " in 2013 . " Beast " should finish the four day weekend with around 25 million .
