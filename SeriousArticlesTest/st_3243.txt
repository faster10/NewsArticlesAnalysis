" Cheers " was a bit like that , but " Frasier " more . What you learn from a drama like " Boss " is that there are big choices I make as that character and you have to believe it ' s possible . I mean , Frasier ended up jumping up and down on a bed , pretending he was having sex with himself ( Laughs ) . This is extraordinary s t . But you have to believe this is possible and coming out of a real situation . So I end up tearing some guys ear off as the mayor and you believe it . Because you bought into why he ' s there . Maybe those things are what you learn as a result of knowing what works . . . you have to lay the foundation .
