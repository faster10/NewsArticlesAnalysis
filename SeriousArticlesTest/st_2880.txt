A : I was invited to the reception in Berlin but I decided not to go because I felt he is so busy with any number of topical issues on the Indo German relations , so certainly talking to him about anything pertaining to my father would have just added a totally different issue which in essence would have been a burden on him I felt . And just to go and say Namashkar ( laughs ) I am sure he would have met me for a few minutes but I felt this would have been more symbolic than anything else . His office has been in touch they asked several times if I would be coming for the 23 January event ( declassification of files ) but few days ago I told them I won t be able to make it they even told me that he would meet me privately , but maybe I will go later in the year . The embassy told me that they would make an appointment for me to see him .
