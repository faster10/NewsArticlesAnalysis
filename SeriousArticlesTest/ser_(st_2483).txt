In doing what I do it will be more of a leadership role . We re shooting Season Two of I Am Cait , and I am learning more . I am so far ahead of where I was six months ago when I came out . Still have a lot to learn . Finances are certainly a big issue in the trans community . I was in New York , at the LGBT center there with a Latina group , and I asked them what their budget is . They do all this work . They ve got HIV testing buses and stuff . And she said , 10 , 000 a year . Are you kidding me ? ! I would like to do my best in the future to work with corporate America to help in fundraising efforts .
