Trump , like Ronald Reagan , has been around for decades . They know exactly who he is . I think that people are really responding because they really do believe that he s got the heft to withstand all the stuff that s going to come down on him and has been coming down on him . When Reagan was President and , for instance , wanted to put missiles in Europe , there were millions of people in the streets of New York and Paris and London and all this saying that he was a warmonger and he was going to kill us all and this kind of stuff . And he never relented . That s what you ve got to have here , is somebody who s got that kind of spine , who is just willing to look these people in the eye and say , too bad .
