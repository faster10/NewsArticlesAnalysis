A : First , I am convinced that if he were alive he would have involved himself in the politics of the time . That might have had a number of consequences . There would have been a prominent alternative to Nehru . Of course we must consider that on some issues they had very similar views . They were both in essence in favour of a political system which was not dominated by communal controversies . They were both modern in the sense that they wanted industrialisation . But on the other hand , there would have been differences for example , I imagine his position vis vis Pakistan would have been different . Nobody really wanted or expected what happened after Partition . The amount of genocide left wounds on both sides which were difficult to overcome but I imagine he would have a different view towards Pakistan . If he could not prevent Partition ? both he and Gandhi wanted to prevent it ? I think he probably would have tried and succeeded in having better relations with Pakistan India has been suffering less from the controversies ( since independence ) because with all the problems India faces , it is a functioning state , and from that point of view Pakistan is in a much worse position .
