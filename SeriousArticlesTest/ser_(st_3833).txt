The Bulls shot 42 . 5 on the night ? 36 . 8 from three point range ? and though their offense wasn t quite the vision new coach Fred Hoiberg must have had in mind , neither was it the slower tempo brand of Tom Thibodeau . It s just a matter of getting to the right spacing , Gasol , who was held to two points on the night , said . Obviously we have more freedom now to play the game , and it s more of a flow game , a transition offense . Every game might be a little different , but we have plenty of weapons and talent to score in a variety of ways .
