Since the NFL adopted a 16 game schedule in 1978 , only six teams have finished a regular season at 15 1 . Of the five previous teams to pull off that type of magical regular season , only two ( 1984 49ers , 1985 Bears ) won the Super Bowl in that year . The last three prior to Carolina ( 1998 Vikings , 2004 Steelers and 2011 Packers ) all fell before reaching the Super Bowl . Now Carolina is one win away from becoming only the third team to finish a year with only one loss and Super Bowl title .
