They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do . They do not want us to exercise religious liberty . That s why as commander in chief , I will take on ISIS , not only because it keeps us safe , but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls . As a Catholic , that s what I want to do . And no matter what your faith is , that s what I want you to be able to do .
