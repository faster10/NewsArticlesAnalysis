Perhaps it would be better to say stay away from the backhand . The Djokovic backhand is so strong , usually , that it pays to steer clear if at all possible . The forehand is much improved in the past few years but remains the side to target at the important times . Technically , it is not quite as sound as the backhand and when he is not quite on his game , Djokovic has a slight tendency to lift the ball long . It was a tactic that worked especially well when Murray beat Djokovic to win the 2012 US Open , using his serve out wide from the deuce court to great effect , often yielding an error or an easy third shot . As Murray said on Friday : You can t afford to do anything poorly . I need to execute my gameplan , not have any lapses in concentration and just play as best a match as I can . He knows that even if he does , it might not be good enough , but going after the forehand on big points will be part of that plan .
