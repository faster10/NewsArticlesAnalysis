A few things . First , in the context of a 700 billion military budget , counter terrorism ? which mainly involves small scale operations ? doesn t require much more than 10 percent . Second , maintaining the nuclear arsenal costs about 20 billion a year ? not hundreds of billions , unless calculated over decades . Does he think we shouldn t maintain the arsenal ? Maybe we don t need as many as 5 , 000 warheads , but maintenance wouldn t cost much less if the number were cut to 1 , 000 . Third , military manpower costs more than maintaining the nuclear arsenal , so how much of an increase does he want , and for what purposes ? Sanders never said .
