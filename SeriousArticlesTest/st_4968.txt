But before you jump to conclusions , this is not the problem with the movie . Though the cynical , adult edge to the comedy may limit the film ' s audience ( it is rated PG 13 ) it also qualifies as a welcome change . Hancock ' s reckless heroism and the wreckage he leaves in his wake inspires the film ' s funniest stuff ( which is why you ' ve probably seen it all in the trailers ) . Cussing , pulling on a bottle of booze as he chases down bad guys and dressing like a wino , Smith has fun playing against type , and in possibly his best big screen performance yet , Jason Bateman makes an engaging comic foil .
