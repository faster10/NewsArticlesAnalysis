Ravi did not invent homophobia , but he is being scapegoated for it . Bias against gay people is , sadly , embedded in American culture . Until last year people were being kicked out of the military because they were homosexuals . None of the four leading presidential candidates President Obama , Mitt Romney , Rick Santorum , Newt Gingrich thinks that gay people should be allowed to get married . A better way to honor the life of Clementi would be for everyone to get off their high horse about a 20 year old kid and instead think about how we can promote civil rights in our own lives .
