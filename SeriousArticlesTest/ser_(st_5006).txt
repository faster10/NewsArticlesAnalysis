After a couple scoreless possessions and three drops from Edelman , Brady s 42 yard connection with Keshawn Martin kick started the Pats fourth drive . And Brady punctuated it , as he scrambled out of the pocket toward the right sideline and tried to dive through a tackler for a score . But the 10 yard scamper was stopped shy of the end zone . Brady leaped over the line on the ensuing play for a 1 yard touchdown and 14 3 lead , and the score capped an 11 play , 98 yard march .
