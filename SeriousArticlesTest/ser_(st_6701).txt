The bigger concern as a head football coach is the video study , he said . Not that ( the coaches ) do but that they do on their own . They all have it on their iPads . It takes a lot mentally to make sure you get yourself in the right frame of mind to play . With all the distractions going on , those are the things that I m concerned about . We ll practice well . I know that . Can we lock in and focus and play our best ? Hopefully we can do that .
