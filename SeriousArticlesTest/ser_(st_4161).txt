At the end of an 8 yard second quarter run , Burfict brought down Bell with a hard tackle along Pittsburgh ' s sideline that appeared to twist the running back ' s knee awkwardly . The injury caused Bell to be helped off the field and loaded onto a cart on the sideline before being taken to the locker room for observation . Bell was quickly ruled out of the game with a right knee injury .
