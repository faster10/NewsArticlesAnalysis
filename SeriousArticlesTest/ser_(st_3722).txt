AG : We were trying to make graphite as thin as possible using lab equipment and for many months we struggled to make it thinner than 10 , 000 layers . Then we had a kind of Eureka moment . We were using scotch tape on a regular basis in the lab to clean the surface of the graphite . We would look at what was happening on the surface of the graphite and throw the scotch tape in the bin . Then we decided to take the tape out of the bin and look at it under the microscope and we saw really transparent pieces of graphite graphene .
