This is the first election since 1990 , when the National League for Democracy won a landslide a victory that was never acknowledged by the army . After years of stalling , now Myanmar ' s military regime is holding an election , which many analysts say is nothing more than a sham to legitimize its rule . Voters will elect representatives to two houses of parliament ( instead of one as before ) and there will be 14 state regional assemblies . The lower house , the People ' s Assembly , will have 440 seats and the upper house , the Nationalities Assembly , will have 224 . There are about 900 seats in the 14 state or regional assemblies . However , with 25 percent of the seats in each of these assemblies is reserved for the military , the seats up for grabs are reduced to 330 , 168 and 665 respectively . Each voter will be casting a vote for each of these three assemblies .
