Boulden believes Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger ' s model of investing time and money into youth players is also a shrewd move . " Arsene Wenger ' s theory is to buy someone when they are young and other clubs haven ' t even noticed them . By the time they come good , and most of them do , he would have to pay 20 million to get these guys . " He says these players can also be sold on for huge profit , like in the case of France striker Nicolas Anelka , who came through the Arsenal youth system before being sold to Real Madrid for 35 million .
