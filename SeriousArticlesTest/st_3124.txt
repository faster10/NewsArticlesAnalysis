Still , there are those two final songs , in which the swirling prog jazz slows to a gentle rocking and a more direct address . They seem to include both his kiss off to music as commerce ( those oligarchs with foaming mouths phone now and again ) and a soul kiss for his fans ? don t believe for just one second I m forgetting you . He lets us see him suffer , as he never was afraid to do : I m trying to , he repeats in Dollar Days , and I m dying , too .
