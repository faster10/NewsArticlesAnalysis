My parents moved us to a nice D . C . suburban neighborhood surrounded by opportunity , but it was isolating . At age 16 , I fell into a deep and dark emotional hole . The stress of school , sports and assimilation became too much to bear . I felt guilty for wanting to abandon my cultural heritage . I stopped feeling loved . I quit caring . I would later learn that this despair I felt was actually a suffering from depression . But at the time , I only knew that I was in unimaginable darkness and loneliness , even if I were surrounded by people .
