Contradiction 1 : Everyone seems to agree that women and men should have equal rights . But when was the last time you heard someone say that a man should make fatherhood a " career " ? It is true today that sometimes , men do become stay at home dads , but even in the consciously feminist families I wrote about in my book , " Gender Vertigo , " men share the " work " of raising their children I didn ' t interview one man who described fatherhood as a career . And it took me a long time to find couples that really shared the work equally .
