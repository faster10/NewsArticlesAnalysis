It looks like it might be time to start taking Blaine Gabbert seriously . Gabbert made two huge plays late in the game to lead San Francisco to the win . First , Gabbert somehow outran the Bears ' defense for a 44 yard TD with under two minutes left that tied the game at 20 . Gabbert followed that up in overtime with a game winning 71 yard TD pass to Torrey Smith . Gabbert totaled 271 yards ( 196 passing , 75 rushing ) in the shocking win .
