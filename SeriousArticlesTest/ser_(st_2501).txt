A " robocall " is an automated phone call that plays a prerecorded message . If you hear a live person and it ' s a telemarketing , advocacy , or survey call , it could still be illegal if it ' s unsolicited , but it ' s not a robocall . Robocalls from political campaigns or get out the vote efforts are allowed ( and legal ) under the FTC ' s Telemarketing Sales Rule , as well as under most state robocall laws ( except when made to cell phone numbers and a few other exceptions ) .
