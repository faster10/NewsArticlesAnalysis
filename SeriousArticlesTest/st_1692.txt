In short , Republican dominance of state and federal offices , with the exception of the presidency , continues . The aging Democratic national leadership team hangs on for now , but a weaker and weaker bench will deprive it of viable candidates for high offices for years to come . Democrats can console themselves with the notion that these are just the results of off year elections but one can easily say that absent a huge turnout that occurs only in presidential years , the Democrats cannot win outside deep blue enclaves ( and even there Republicans won governorships in Massachusetts and Maryland in 2014 ) .
