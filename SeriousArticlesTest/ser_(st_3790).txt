David Burstein , filmmaker and author of the forthcoming book on millennials , " Fast Future : How the Millennial Generation Is Shaping Our World , " tells me that " with sustained increased youth participation in 2004 , 2008 and now 2012 , it ' s impossible to say that young people don ' t show up to vote .
