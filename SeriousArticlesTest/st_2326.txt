Muslims believe that God granted the Prophet and his followers astounding military victories as a sign of his favor . But this expansion was eventually halted and reversed . There was the reconquest of Spain in the 15th century , the defeat of Muslim forces at Lepanto in the 16th century , and the fall of the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century . According to Islam ' s religious tenets , Islamic civilization ' s defeats , reversals , and retreats are not just unfortunate turns of history , but can be viewed as signs of apostasy and a need for reform of the ummah . It is not a coincidence that after the fall of the Ottoman Empire , Salafist and Wahhabist Islam grew . Wahhabism , for instance , grew out of the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence , which advocates a constant return to the sources of Islam as a source of renewal and purification for the faithful .
