On the night of the Iowa caucuses , I was with Dukakis in his Des Moines hotel when the numbers came in . Missouri congressman Dick Gephardt was first , at 31 . 3 percent . Illinois senator Paul Simon won 26 . 7 percent . Behind him was Dukakis , with 22 . 2 percent . The problem was that Dukakis was supposed to have come in first . It ' s what his political and financial backers expected it ' s why Boston TV ( which broadcast to the New Hampshire media market ) was going live with his Iowa victory speech . The only stumbling block : no victory .
