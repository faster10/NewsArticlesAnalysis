Good god , look who we ' re running against , South Carolina Sen . Lindsey Graham said , before unloading on Clinton and Sen . Bernie Sanders ( I Vt . ) , who is also running for the Democratic nomination . The number one candidate on the other side thought she was flat broke after her and her husband were in the White House for eight years . The number two guy went to the Soviet Union on his honeymoon and I don ' t think he ever came back .
