" My loyalty to country and team is beyond reproach . I humbly serve as a guardian to my fellow Americans , always ready to defend those who are unable to defend themselves . I do not advertise the nature of my work , nor seek recognition for my actions . I voluntarily accept the inherent hazards of my profession , placing the welfare and security of others before my own . I serve with honor on and off the battlefield . The ability to control my emotions and my actions , regardless of circumstance , sets me apart from other men . . . . In the absence of orders I will take charge , lead my teammates and accomplish the mission . . . . I will never quit . I persevere and thrive on adversity . My nation expects me to be physically harder and mentally stronger than my enemies . If knocked down , I will get back up , every time . I will draw on every remaining ounce of strength to protect my teammates and to accomplish our mission . I am never out of the fight . "
