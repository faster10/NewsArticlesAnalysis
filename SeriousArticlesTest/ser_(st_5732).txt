I did meet my mother ' s family briefly during an earlier trip as a journalist , escaping from the pack and the Cuban minders to sit in their modest white home and hear stories of how they lived . I answered so many questions about my life . It was awkward . The difference in our circumstances was so vast , and we only had a few hours to broach it . I did get to look at their eyes and freckles and cocoa black skin , the curls and the friendliness and the warmth of family ties , to feel familiarity and truly appreciate my Mom .
