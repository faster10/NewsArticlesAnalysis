" My father told me , just be good at something , " Newton said . " He said , if you ' re great at something , you ' ll always be compensated for it . Whether you ' re the best firefighter , the best police officer , the best artist , the best rapper , the best preacher , football player , basketball player , your skill will get you compensated for what you want in this life . I ' m happy I had the influence of the people like my father in my life , and it has carried me to the point I am right now . "
