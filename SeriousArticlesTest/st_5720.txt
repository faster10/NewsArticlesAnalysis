Kratz used Manitowoc County s unwavering belief in the honesty of authority figures to make people ignore the numerous issues with his case against Avery . The city of Cleveland can throw human error at us , but what is being done to remedy a system where a police dispatcher can fail to inform an officer that the gun being held by their potential suspect is probably a toy ? Does it make sense that the FBI analyst and the prosecutor both believe that opening fire on Tamir Rice mere seconds after arriving at the scene was reasonable ? Should we maybe reconsider how we legally define such a term when it comes to a fatality ?
