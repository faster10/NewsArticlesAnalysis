It was a filthy and stupid libel . And hugely influential too , the urtext for the asinine . If Charlie Hebdo is racist then it s not very good at it . Witness the routine and constant support of Charlie on the part of SOS Racisme , France s main anti racism campaigning group . And know too that justice minister , Christiane Taubira , the victim of the infamous monkey cartoon , was so wounded and offended that she gave an extraordinary , moving speech at the funeral of one of the murdered cartoonists . The New Yorker s arrogant libel was the equivalent of a French person who speaks no English confidently asserting that Chris Rock is a dodgy fascist . You don t have to sift Rock s act very carefully to find stuff that would make non English speakers hair catch fire .
