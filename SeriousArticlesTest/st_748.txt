Mr Trump has taken the politician s characteristic fudging of facts to new heights of mendacity . He is the first candidate to render journalists ? those who attempt to hold the powerful to account ? close to irrelevant , in so far as he can spout demonstrable nonsense ( and be challenged on it ) and gain all the while . This bespeaks a part of the US body politic that has simply lost all faith with traditional media , and now finds itself unmoored from any kind of objective truth , floating instead through the unsourced wildernesses of the internet .
