With the exception of state controlled flag carrier Aeroflot , the Russian airline industry has historically operated on a shoestring , using cheap old European and U . S . aircraft to fly its international routes , and even older Russian built ones to service domestic ones . As a result , the country has the worst air safety record in the world . The weekend disaster was the seventh fatal incident involving Russian airlines in the last five years ( one in 2011 wiped out one of the country s top hockey teams ) .
