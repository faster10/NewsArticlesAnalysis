Prop Mako Vunipola and scrum half Richard Wigglesworth will use the Aviva Premiership fixture for valuable game time ahead of the trip to Dublin to face Ireland next Sunday , while centre Brad Barritt will hope to push his case for a recall to the match day 23 . The main focus will be on Alex Goode , though , as the full back may be brought back into the England starting XV for the clash with the Irish , if Mike Brown is unable to recover from his concussion in time to play .
