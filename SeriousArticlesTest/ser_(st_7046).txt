Oh God . It was bad . I mean , it was bad . There s no way to sugarcoat it , Greenberg began . This is not a good running team , but they seem to really love to run the ball on 1st and 10 , and it s just ? it s not successful . They really don t do anything that a successful team would do , right ? They barely pressured Matt Cassel last night , he was only under pressure on seven of his 31 dropbacks . They didn t do a good job of stopping Dez Bryant , especially in a crucial situation . Jason Witten was catching balls all over the field . I mean this is just a team that seems to play more to its weaknesses than its strengths , and we see that in the running game , especially on first down .
