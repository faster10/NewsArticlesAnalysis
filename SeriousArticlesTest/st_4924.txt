What ' s left to learn is this : Les Mis rables provides compelling reasons for Crowe to be peeved , beginning with the humiliation of having to sing Broadway style , when it clearly is so not his thing , and ending with the Cap ' n Crunch wardrobe into which the gentleman is packed . ( O , for Crowe ' s costumed glory days in Master and Commander : The Far Side of the World ! ) Jackman has a right to be cranky too , although he ' s too much of a trouper to show it as he overemotes on demand and sings of finding God after he steals a pair of candlesticks from a nice priest . ( Long story . ) Hathaway looks happy enough channeling Liza Minnelli for her tremulous rendition of the Susan Boyle appropriated anthem ' ' I Dreamed a Dream , ' ' but that ' s no doubt because she knows that soon after the song , she ' s pretty much done for the night .
