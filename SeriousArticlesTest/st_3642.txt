" We have attempted to address this customer ' s service concerns , but offering increasing amounts of compensation based on a threat of a safety violation isn ' t really fair especially when the passenger himself said he didn ' t follow the crew members ' instructions and fasten his seat belt , " US Airways said in a written statement . " If there was a safety issue we will address that professionally and with the proper attention toward preventing it from happening again . We have already provided feedback on the service issues with the team involved , and thank Mr Berkowitz for making his concerns known . "
