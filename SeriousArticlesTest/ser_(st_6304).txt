Stephen Curry has elevated his game to an entirely new level this season , so it s considered a mild disappointment when he scores just 19 points with seven assists , three steals and three treys in 28 minutes . Klay Thompson kept his foot on the gas pedal with 21 points , seven assists , ? three boards , one block and four treys , and his fantasy arrow is pointing up now that he is over his back issue . Andre Iguodala stayed hot with 12 points on 5 of 6 shooting with two 3 pointers , three rebounds , four assists , four steals and one block , and he is a legitimate frontrunner to win the Sixth Man of the Year Award . He s adjusting to his bench role a lot better than he did last season , and he is currently returning top 75 value . Draymond Green got into some foul trouble , but he still managed to score 13 points with seven boards , four assists , one block and three treys .
