That ' s the kick of " Hot Sauce " the Beasties sound exactly like themselves , cutting loose without straining to fit anyone else ' s idea of relevance . Adam " MCA " Yauch , Michael " Mike D " Diamond and Adam " Ad Rock " Horowitz originally scheduled " Hot Sauce " for release in 2009 , until the project was derailed by MCA ' s battle with cancer . Now cheekily retitled " Hot Sauce Committee Part Two , " it ' s their first album in seven years , unless you count 2007 ' s stoner funk instrumental throwaway , " The Mix Up . " It ' s also a return to classic Beasties chutzpah : On " Hot Sauce Committee , " they ' re not sweating to impress anyone except one another .
