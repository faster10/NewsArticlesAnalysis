Morgenstern : I ' m a little bit involved . I ' ve heard bits and pieces they ' re still in the early stages of production , trying to assemble the best team to put the film together . Everyone is so enthusiastic and really loves the book , so it seems like it ' s in really good hands . So I hope they can take the book and make it stand alone as a film . I don ' t want to have that much input anyway it ' s not really something I do . I ' m interested but I definitely just want them to run with it .
