So my guess is that Hillary is hoping to brazen it out . Keep the FBI busy with the droppings from her server : the shocking intelligence breeches , the incriminating foundation solicitations , and forget not her tantalizing hints about yoga ? her yoga ! She will hope to cop the nomination at the Democratic National Convention and try for victory in November , though that now appears unlikely . She had a chance against former Republican Gov . George Pataki , but when he bowed out of the race I think her chances for the presidency went aglimmer .
