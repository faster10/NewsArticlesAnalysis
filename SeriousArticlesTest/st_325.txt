Today s political spotlight ? once again ? is fixed on Donald Trump , given the three new polls ( national ? NYT CBS , ? Fox News of South Carolina , Winthrop of South Carolina ) that show him leading the Republican presidential race . But now 53 days out from the first nominating contest , it s time to consider Ted Cruz another frontrunner in the GOP race at least when it comes to the Iowa caucuses . Ted Cruz , the no compromise conservative purist , is on the verge of securing the Christian conservative bloc , a linchpin that could secure victory in the 2016 Iowa caucuses , GOP insiders say , per the ? Des Moines Register . The question is whether Cruz can siphon enough tea party voters from front runner Donald Trump to vault Cruz into the No . 1 slot when votes are counted less than two months from now , they say . The ? Washington Post s Cillizza adds ? that Cruz is also set up well for the March 1 contests . Assuming Cruz is one of those candidates who makes it to March , the calendar starts to look very favorable to him . On March 1 is what s being referred to as the SEC primary Alabama , Arkansas , Georgia , Tennessee and Texas will all vote on that first Tuesday in March .
