" 2016 " has earned 9 . 1 million after seven weekends , making it the highest grossing conservative documentary ever , above " Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed , " which grossed 7 . 7 million in 2008 . While the film has already earned more than most documentaries could ever dream of earning ( Weintein ' s much publicized doc Bully grossed 3 . 5 million ) , its gross doesn ' t yet compare to Michael Moore ' s liberal doc " Fahrenheit 9 11 , " which grossed 119 . 2 million in 2004 , George W . Bush ' s re election year . Keep in mind that film had a major studio ( Lionsgate ) and marketing campaign behind it , and it opened in 868 theaters . 2016 opened in one theater in Houston and had to rely on word of mouth and talk radio promotions before its national ad campaign kicked off two weeks ago .
