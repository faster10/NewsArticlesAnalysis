In the late 1990s , Warner Bros . Pictures struck a three picture deal with then rising R B star Aaliyah . One of the star making vehicles was to be " Sparkle , " to which the studio owned the rights . Under their BrownHouse Productions shingle , Martin Chase and Houston were tapped to help bring the remake to life . But shortly after Aaliyah ' s second film , " Queen of the Damned , " wrapped , tragedy struck when the singer died in a plane crash .
