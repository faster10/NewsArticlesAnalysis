ABOUT THE DOLPHINS ( 4 5 ) : Miami is one of six teams within one game of the final AFC wild card spot but is struggling on offense and has oddly given up a safety in three consecutive games . We re over those issues , center Mike Pouncey told reporters . Every time , it s always been something different to why it happened . It s one of those fluke situations . I feel like when it happened again on Sunday , it kind of felt like it was going to go down that same path , but our team fought back out of it , we never gave up . The defense led the way last week despite losing several players to injury , and the Dolphins hope to at least have cornerback Brent Grimes ( illness ) back this week .
