Parents are covered , but only to 1996 welfare levels . This keeps a lot of parents , even those who are very poor , from qualifying for Medicaid . Two parents and a child living in Alabama , Arkansas , Indiana , Louisiana or Texas with an income of 4 , 850 a year actually earn too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid . And if you ' re not a parent , then things are even worse . In most states , if you have no children , you can ' t qualify for Medicaid no matter how little you make . In most states , even if you make no money at all , there ' s no Medicaid for you .
