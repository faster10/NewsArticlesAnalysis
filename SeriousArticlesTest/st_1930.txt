( On if it was hard to see that last year s Super Bowl was effecting the beginning of this season at that time : ) Well I was trying to not bring it to light any more than I had to , because I was working with it the whole time . This was no surprise . I continue to remind you guys that it s the same kind of bulk issue that you have to deal with when you win too . You still have problems and concerns that serve as distractions that you have to push aside . We ve been through it . We ve really seen what that s all about , and we ve learned from it , and our players know . They know what we went through and all . We were actively working to clear our minds , and to clear our focus , and to get right , and it just took a while . It took a while to work our way through it , and as we had said , it comes down to individual guys have to make it through . The coaches have to make it through it , and we have to put it behind us . Otherwise , you re distracted , and your performance comes out less than everything that you have , and that s why we saw games like that . Because you saw us turn out , and you saw how well we played for such a long time , and you can see the potential of this team . The exciting part of that is that our team knows that . They saw that . So that s why we re moving ahead , I think from a very , very good starting point , beginning today .
