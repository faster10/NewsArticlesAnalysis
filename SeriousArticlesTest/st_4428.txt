During the Ebola epidemic it was not only educational institutions that were affected , and the economy of Sierra Leone came to a screeching halt . During this time many families used their girls to bring in financial support by any means , including using sex as a bartering tool . Also many young girls had relatives who died due to Ebola and left the children to fend for themselves and again many used sex as a means of survival . A Save the Children study in July reported that 10 percent of extremely vulnerable girls were trading sex for basic life needs , teenage pregnancy also increased by 47 percent during the Ebola outbreak . Supposedly many men went to young girls because the older women were more knowledgeable about Ebola risks and were in a better position to deny these men sex .
