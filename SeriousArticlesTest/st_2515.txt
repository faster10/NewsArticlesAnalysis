But to win the primaries , Romney still needed the votes of that big block of conservatives . So he underwent a rebranding . For the record , the conservative movement never entirely bought Romney ' s conversion . That ' s why he lost Iowa to Santorum and South Carolina to Gingrich . Thereafter he was dogged for some weeks by Santorum , whose electoral coalition tended to be poorer , more religious , more conservative and more rural . In these truly competitive primaries , Romney ' s vote was often rich , moderate and elderly ( no wonder Mr Burns was such a fan ) .
