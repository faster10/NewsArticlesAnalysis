Instead , they foreshadowed an expansion of steps the U . S . is already taking , namely airstrikes and train and equip missions for rebels inside Syria . Obama also urged Putin to concentrate on fighting ISIS , and met with him to discuss it . Obama also plans to meet with European allies after the summit to attempt to bolster their common front in Syria , but there are no immediate plans for any major changes in current strategies .
