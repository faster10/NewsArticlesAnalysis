Brady is given credit for an 11 5 record in his career meetings against Manning . It ' s probably more accurate to say Belichick has an 11 5 record against Manning . Belichick has been a big reason Manning has just one Super Bowl title . It ' s also fair to wonder if that record would be reversed if Manning had Belichick as his coach for his entire career . He is one of the rare men who has significantly impacted the legacies of both Brady and Manning .
