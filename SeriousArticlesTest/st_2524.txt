While I can t see the Vikings entirely closing the 31 point gap that existed between these two teams when they met in Minneapolis in Week 13 ? a 38 ? 7 Seattle rout ? the extremely cold conditions that are forecast for this game should serve to somewhat restrict the Seahawks productive passing game and thus narrow the margin of Seattle s dominance . The Vikings will probably try to put matters on the shoulders of running back Adrian Peterson , asking him to carry the bulk of the offense and hopefully shorten the game . But if the freezing temperatures make passing treacherous , perhaps the return of Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch is a fortuitous turn of events that will help Seattle tough out the win in a difficult road setting .
