The rift between the RNC and the candidates will , eventually , prove disastrous for the long term viability of the party . What the candidates are really protesting here isn t the length or format of the debate . What they want is for the debate to resemble the echo chamber of Fox News and talk radio . They complain about the pressure to engage and confront one another , but isn t that what debates are for ? Ted Cruz wants sycophants to ask loaded questions that allow candidates to deliver rehearsed soliloquies , but that s what stump speeches are for ? debates are about forced collisions .
