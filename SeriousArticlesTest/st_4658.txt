We need that simple plan : A " nothing big " again this year . Not only to help those children , but to teach our own kids . We can get 24 , 000 down to zero . And we can show our kids that they can make a difference that every penny counts , that they can save a child and change the world . So they ' ll carry the boxes now , you and I can fill the bowl by the door to the brim and be ready , and this year Trick or Treat for UNICEF can make that change .
