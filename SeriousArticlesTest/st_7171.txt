I think that the joke very quickly got out of hand . And I think where I was at fault was that I was probably a little sensitive about it , because I could actually see the potential of this sort of thing to get out of control . And it did . We played in a game at West Ham and the terraces started singing something particularly defamatory about me and I remember being , you know , really , really shocked that it got to that level so quickly .
