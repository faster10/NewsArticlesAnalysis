Obviously seeing him play and thought he was good out of the backfield , caught a lot of passes out of the backfield , but once he got here I ve just been impressed with his football awareness , his knowledge , and his feel for route running , Manning said in a conference call Wednesday . He just has a natural feel , how to get open , where the lanes are , where the openings are , and has been impressive with his playmaking ability and what he can do whether out of the backfield or splitting him out wide , or running the football , catching the football , he s an impressive football player .
