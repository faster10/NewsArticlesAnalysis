As for the rest of the field , both Gov . John Kasich and Carly Fiorina gave decent performances that will keep them from sliding down in the pack , while Donald Trump and Ben Carson were just good enough to avoid damaging their brands and their standings . Jeb Bush still struggles with the format at one point , he had a hard time telling a joke and eventually abandoned it to make another point . At the same time ? and unlike the last debate ? Bush didn t do or say anything to tank his candidacy , which counts as a victory .
