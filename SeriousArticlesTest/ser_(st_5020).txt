Rick Santorum raised eyebrows this past weekend for saying Obama wants to impose a " phony theology " on America . Santorum has since tried to clarify that he was not trying to raise doubts about the president ' s religion and I ' ll take him at his word . Likewise , when Santorum compares GOP primary voters to members of the " greatest generation " called to act against the rise of Nazi Germany , I ' ll assume that Santorum isn ' t intentionally comparing the president to Hitler .
