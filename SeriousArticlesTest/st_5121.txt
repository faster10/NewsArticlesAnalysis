Most importantly , Democrats like Hillary Clinton will never again accept money from prison lobbyists or expect to win the presidency after voting for devastating wars like Iraq . If the Democratic Party learns the hard way , it won ' t be my fault . It will be the fault of pragmatists who ' ve coddled the DNC for fear of Supreme Court nominees , or the allure of political power . I ' m only voting for Bernie Sanders , primarily because we still live in a democracy , and I ' ll vote based upon my conscience . Bernie Sanders is a once in a lifetime political figure , and I won ' t settle for his antithesis , simply to appease the same people who ' ve allowed the Democratic Party to become what it is today .
