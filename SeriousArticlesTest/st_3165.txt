I kind of , as the season went along , I went a bit against the grain . Usually you re supposed to completely support your head coach whatever he says , whether he is crazy or otherwise . And I just couldn t do it , he said . I thought it was a championship caliber team and I got ostracized for feeling that way . It wasn t just one thing , just a bunch of different things I don t want to get into . I really believe in this roster , and really it was just a disagreement between me and Mark .
