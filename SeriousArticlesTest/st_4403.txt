In some cases in which I have been involved , victims have been left alone , were poorly guarded , did not try to escape or seemed almost compliant in a variety of ways in their victimization . Victims may even feel guilt , shame and embarrassment or blame themselves as a result of this . In my opinion , the victims who survived the odds did the right thing , whatever it was . The Patty Hearst case is one in which society and the criminal justice system struggled with abduction victim accountability for behavior that helped lead to survival .
