If you ' re cataloguing why things seemed ? somehow both off and on Sunday with Fox s musical Grease : Live ! ( 1 2 out of four ) , you can start with the use of that nonsensical opening title song , written for the movie and emblematic of the progressive ? dumbing down of the material . A Broadway musical that originally spoofed our ? rose tinted glasses view of the 50s has turned into a nostalgic wallow , leaving the show with an odd mix of tones ? ? and in this particular version , a book that sometimes seemed to get lost between songs and inside jokes .
