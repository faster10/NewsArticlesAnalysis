Speaking of which , Mad Max : Fury Road is still barreling on down the road to February . The film is up for Best Motion Picture , Drama , in the company of more typical Best Picture contenders Carol , The Revenant , Room and Spotlight . An action movie certainly has a better chance of winning at the Globes than at the Oscars , but the surest bet in a year in which there are no sure bets is Spotlight , which has hogged much of the attention thus far . In the race for Best Motion Picture , Musical or Comedy , The Big Short s rollicking take on the 2007 08 financial crisis seems poised to take that movie to the top ( of the Globes , at least ) , though The Martian is by no means stranded in outer space .
