Sooner or later , the lackluster offensive efforts have to land on the coaching staff . Tomsula needs to try something different , even with the RB injuries . Mix it up somehow and prove that a football mind can think of things no one else can , even if they don t work . This team is 2 6 and once again , the game was all but over by halftime . That s been the case in three road losses this season already . Tomsula has shown he can rally his team more effectively at home , but the road games continue to be a disaster . Why can t this team come out fired up away from Levi s Stadium ?
