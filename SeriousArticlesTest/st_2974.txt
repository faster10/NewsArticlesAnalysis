" To be realistic , it ' s going to be a daunting task , even with Romo , to get our feet back under us , " Jones said . " The team is playing at a level of effort . To some degree , with Cassel out there , we have a better level of execution . I think we have a chance to win games over the next two or possibly three weeks . Obviously , we think we ' ll play better when we get Romo back . "
