AK : My faith keeps me humble and keeps my feet on the ground . I pray and I do things privately . It gives me strength when I go in the ring . I know I ' m not on my own , I ' ve got God on my side as well , God ' s helping me , God ' s going to give me that inner strength to go in there and win the fight . Boxing in the ring is a lonely place , it ' s just you and your opponent , no one else , so you know spiritually when you have that help it makes a massive difference . It gives you so much confidence .
