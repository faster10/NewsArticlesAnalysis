Sooner is better than later . We have a good , liberal candidate who should encourage us to adopt a newer , smarter form of politics , one where we share responsibility for change instead of looking for a messiah figure to save us all . She s a lady , to boot . This is something to celebrate and yes , get enthused about . I won t be crying if ? Clinton wins in 2016 ( much , anyway ) . But I will ? probably be grinning .
