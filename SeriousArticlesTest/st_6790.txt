DAKOTA : I ' m proud of ( the movie ) . I completely disagree with people who think Ana ' s weak . I think she ' s actually stronger than he is . Everything she does is her choice . And if I can be an advocate for women to do what they want with their bodies and not be ashamed of what they want , then I ' m all for that . My mom came up for a day during filming . She ' s proud of me . But I don ' t want my family to see the movie , because it ' s inappropriate . Or my brothers ' friends , who I grew up with . I think they ' d be like , Blegh ( mimics vomiting ) . Also there ' s part of me that ' s like , I don ' t want anyone to see this movie . Just kidding .
