Because North Korea is a nuclear armed country , responding with military action has been largely ruled out . Any strike against North Korean nuclear facilities , much less an attack on the nuclear armed country , would result in catastrophe for the Korean peninsula and the entire region . Instead , the US and South Korea will probably escalate their show of force in upcoming joint military exercises , as they did in the spring of 2013 . But overflights of B 2 bombers and large scale troop movements will only reinforce Pyongyang s view of America s hostile policy and make North Korea even more determined to maintain and increase its nuclear deterrent .
