Pederson : Reid could care less about Lurie and the Eagles . He ' s about him and the Chiefs . Something tells me he has a guy on his staff he ' d like to move up and wants Pederson out of the way . Kind of like when he was recommending Brad Childress for jobs , so he could promote Marty Mornhinweg . The coach on the KC staff who should be getting interviews is defensive coordinator Bob Sutton . But Reid is talking him up , because he doesn ' t want to lose him .
