I wrote a HuffPost article almost four years ago entitled " People Before Profit , Rahm ! " that wrestled with Mayor Emanuel ' s persona and our Chicago reality . Well , with the revelation of a grand coverup and conspiracy in the brutal , savage and merciless killing of 17 year old Laquan McDonald by Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke , we are at the crossroads of truth and justice vs greed and class . Our young and capable Black Lives Matter ( and Chicago ' s own Black Youth Project 100 ) warriors are confronting the ' powers ' . The ' powers ' can be defined as those who have chosen profit over equality ( i . e . , a level playing field ) . It is plain to those who have taken to the streets that this video cannot be explained away by the most contrarian of pundits . Jason Van Dyke has had 20 complaints in his career and no disciplinary reprimand . Can you imagine all the people Van Dyke crippled before video ?
