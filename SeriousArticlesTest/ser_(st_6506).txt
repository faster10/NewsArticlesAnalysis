Bernie Sanders is more an idea than a person . An idea does not need to comb its hair . An idea can get away with skipping the task that occupies so much of most politicians ? ? ? time ? ? phoning the rich to ask for money ? ? by instead writing fundraising letters , which contain words that make people with money anxious , like ? ? ? oligarchy . ? ? ?
