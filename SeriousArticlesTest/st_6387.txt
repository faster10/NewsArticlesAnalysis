Feel bad for Maclin , such a great guy , such a good player , and great teammate . However , Philly didn t want to go as high on that contract as KC did for this reason . You ll get one season , then he ll be out for a year , spend the next year at 75 recovering and then while having a great year in the third year , boom this sad and horrible type of thing happens . So KC just guaranteed over 35M for about one season and like 3 games . In year four you re going to cut him because the cap hit and risk are too high . So unfortunately for the Chiefs they got the one season of greatness out of the way already and it was sadly wasted with garbage Alex Smith on a team that has literally a negative percentage of winning a title . Maclin deserves so much better . He should have better luck , better knees , and a much better QB than sad AS . So KC will get demolished next week in NE and poor JMac is out till 2018 . Sorry KC , maybe if Andy drafted a real QB ? Just thinking .
