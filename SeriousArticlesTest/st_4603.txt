There ' s a lot of room for growth with this team , and hopefully we ' ll continue to get better and better as the season goes on and play our best basketball at the end of the season , Butler said . But yeah , the execution ' s got to continue to get better . I know our guys have been kind of in and out of the lineup , we ' ve had some difficulty with that , but it shouldn ' t matter who ' s on the floor . You should be able to go out and execute your plays .
