In fairness , a lot could still change . It s still early . The history ( 2008 ) suggests overconfidence by the Clinton camp would be folly . There are three more debates before the voting begins , and a strong showing by Sanders ? or a serious mistake by Clinton ? could shake up the race . So could more revelations about Clinton s e mails . What s more , we have little polling with which to gauge what is happening in many of the states that come after the early contests , so Clinton s demographic edge could prove illusory . And as noted above , a comeback win in Iowa for Sanders really could scramble the dynamic in a very significant way .
