Ted Cruz is still in fourth place , and he also received a bounce from the last debate , although much smaller than Rubio ' s . Cruz rose from 8 . 4 percent to 9 . 6 percent , and has seen some double digit polling ( though not as consistently as Rubio ) . Cruz , however , continues a slow rise in the polling that has lasted for the past few months . He has always positioned himself to reap the biggest benefit if Trump or Carson ever do fall , by attempting to appeal to the voters who are currently supporting Trump and Carson . Their fall hasn ' t happened yet , but he ' s still got a great shot of corralling their voters ( greater even than Rubio , most likely ) should such a collapse ever actually happen , of course . Cruz has been targeting Rubio of late , so this will be an interesting dynamic to watch in the debate .
