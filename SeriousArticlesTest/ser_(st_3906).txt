Quincy Jones : I always wanted to be a trumpet player . By the time I got to Garfield High School I was starting to be pretty good . I was in all the bands at the school concert bands , dance bands , the gospel bands . Back then , Ray Charles and I used to pretend we were older than we were so that we could sneak into the jazz clubs around the city . Later we started playing in nightclubs it was brilliant .
