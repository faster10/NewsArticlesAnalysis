" Our guys strike people out . So if we ' re not striking people out , we better catch the baseball , " Collins said . " We ' ve really got to make sure defensively we ' ve got the right people there . But I still think we ' ll strike some people out , because I think our guys have got good stuff . That ' s why it ' s going to be exciting for me to watch these matchups as they unfold our good pitching against their good hitting . They ' ve got pretty good pitching , too . We ' ve seen Edinson Volquez for years , and he never threw like he ' s throwing now . "
