Nii Quaynor : Actually I don ' t know , but perhaps I made a lot of effort to get my colleagues to understand and to participate and to begin to contribute to the internet . And I have been fortunate with a very good educational background and so I also wanted to impart the knowledge and I was a major contributor in building some of the important technical institutions that make up the internet ecosystem in Africa . In the process of doing that a lot of people perhaps felt that my leadership was good for them , and you might say , gave me that kind of description .
