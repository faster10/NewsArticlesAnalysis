Feeling outraged ? Then please remember two things : First , every election matters . A responsible governor in Michigan would never have allowed these decisions to be made . Responsible state legislators would never have passed laws that subvert democracy . Second , it was ordinary citizens whose voices finally brought this situation to light . They were ignored . They were belittled . But they didn ' t give up . As a movement , this is our most powerful force : people like you and me , standing up for what we know is right , and never giving up until justice is served .
