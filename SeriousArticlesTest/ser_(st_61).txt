It works like this : Customers who use debit cards to fill up can enter their mobile phone numbers when they buy a lottery ticket at the pump . Their lottery numbers are then sent to their phone via text message , and the pump prints out a receipt . After the drawing , drivers get a text message telling them whether they won . Drivers can track their playing history and choose to have winnings of 599 or less paid directly to their accounts . Credit cards are not permitted .
