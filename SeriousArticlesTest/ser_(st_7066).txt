Diversity notwithstanding , the Academy typically draws ire for what critics see as its praising mediocrity and overlooking actual groundbreaking work . The Best Picture nomination for The Blind Side in 2010 , for instance , came as a shock for many because of its lack of critical acclaim . On the other hand , now classic films such as The Shawshank Redemption , It s a Wonderful Life , and Scorsese ' s Taxi Driver were never awarded the golden statuette . Cinema icons Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick also represent famous snubs , with neither having won a single Oscar for Best Director .
