When Season One was over , I sat down with the other transgender women who are regularly on the show and said what did we accomplish ? And we all kind of agreed that we opened up a conversation which has been swept under the rug for so long . I want to continue that conversation , I want to take it a little deeper . But more importantly , I feel like our show is not a show about me . I don t want it to be about me . I want this show to be about all these stories that are out there , the people , the hardship . For the second season , I ve got my whole tribe of girls , and we re all on a bus . It s kind of trans across America . We went to the Grand Canyon . Then we went to Santa Fe , New Mexico , where they just for the first time have gender neutral bathrooms . Eventually , because of what Houston did , we re probably going to work our way there , see what we can do , what might work , what might not work to help the cause . We re all over the place .
