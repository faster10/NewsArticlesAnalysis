It ' s very weird how genes are . Dave Grohl , Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear came over to a house where I was living . It was the first time the ex Nirvana members had been together in a long time . And they had what I call the " K . C . Jeebies , " which is when they see me , they see Kurt . They look at me , and you can see they ' re looking at a ghost . They were all getting the K . C . Jeebies hardcore . Dave said , " She is so much like Kurt . " They were all talking amongst themselves , rehashing old stories I ' d heard a million times . I was sitting in a chair , chain smoking , looking down like this affects total boredom . And they went , " You are doing exactly what your father would have done . "
