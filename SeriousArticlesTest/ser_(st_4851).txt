Israel ' s cabinet has been ordered not to speak publicly about Morsy ' s overthrow , presumably for fear that if Israeli officials comment , they ' ll immediately be blamed , in a region prone to conspiracy theories . In fact their feelings are likely to be mixed : Israel sees the Muslim Brotherhood ' s ideology as a profound security threat , but they had continued to cooperate with the Egyptian authorities on border security , and will now be concerned that the fresh political uncertainty could distract the army from securing the large and often lawless Sinai region along Israel ' s border , home to a number of jihadi movements .
