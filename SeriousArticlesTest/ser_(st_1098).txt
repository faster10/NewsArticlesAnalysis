Guiliano : Balance that ' s what it ' s about . At the end of the day , each of us is responsible for our own balance . It starts with the physical because when you are healthy physically , of course , you have more energy , you are more bubbly , you are more productive , you ' re a happier person . And I believe it ' s contagious . Your spouse will notice it , your colleagues will notice it , and it will have a tremendous positive effect on the way you work , the way you think and the way you do everything .
