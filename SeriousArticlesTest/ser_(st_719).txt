What he has made happen is undeniable : Stone Temple Pilots roaring grunge era anthems ? ? hits like Interstate Love Song , Plush , and Big Empty ? ? owed much to the snake hipped , narcotic swathed allure of Weiland himself , whose rock roll excesses were constantly , almost gleefully chronicled in the press .
