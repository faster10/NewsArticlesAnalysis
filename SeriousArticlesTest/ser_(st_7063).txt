Cornerback Malcolm Butler mostly took Bills receiver Sammy Watkins out of the game , tight end Charles Clay had a quiet night and for the most part the Pats kept running back LeSean McCoy in front of them . Late in the game , when the Patriots had a seven point lead , they ran into the line three straight times and punted , trusting the defense wouldn t give up the lead at the end . And New England ' s defense came through , never letting the Bills cross midfield before time ran out .
