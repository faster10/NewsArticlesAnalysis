This is easily the most wide open NFL playoff field in years , and a case can be made ? or not ? for half of the entrants to emerge as the champ . What gives ? The New England Patriots , having lost four of their past six games , seem ripe to be dethroned , weakened by so many injuries . Their momentum is kaput . But they still have Tom Brady ? or at least a couple of weeks to get him healthy ? and they have Bill Belichick , challenged to create coaching magic . Don ' t count out the Patriots just yet , especially when considering the flaws of the other AFC contenders . A great quarterback can still make the difference . But the inconsistency that Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos have shown is nothing to bank on . The Arizona Cardinals , Seattle Seahawks and top seeded Carolina Panthers have their big time quarterbacks , too . But Arizona ? despite getting clobbered by surging Seattle in the regular season finale ? will bring the Carson Palmer armed offense that will match up best to exploit the Carolina secondary if the Seahawks don ' t upset Cam Newton and the Panthers first . To get to Santa Clara , Calif . , the Cardinals just might have another date with the proud two time defending NFC champs , who have grown another dimension with the exploits of Russell Wilson . But it would be so fitting if the Cardinals got that opportunity . Maybe it ' s just a hunch that Bruce Arians and his balanced team will push through . As it stands now , that hunch might be as good as any for the wild ride this NFL postseason promises to be .
