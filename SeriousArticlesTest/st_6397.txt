People who like the Nexus phones would most likely welcome the news that Google taking full charge of the Nexus programme . The Nexus phones like the Nexus 5 and the Nexus 6P came close to perfection but something or other held them back . With Google driving the programme , it is possible there is a sort of perfection in the Nexus phones that has eluded them so far . But such a move may not go well with companies like Samsung and HTC that are partners of Google and use Android in their high end phones . With its own Nexus phones , Google would not only directly compete with the iPhone buy also devices like the HTC M9 and the Galaxy S6 , which are made by its partners .
