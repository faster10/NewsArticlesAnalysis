" Citigroup just laid off 11 , 000 . UBS laid off 10 , 000 worldwide , so I ' m still in a holding pattern , " Alvo says . " I ' ve been in and out of markets for 25 years , and there ' s always an excuse there ' s an election coming up , or it ' s the end of the year , wait ' til the budgets get finalized . . . . But as time passes , it gets more difficult . People look at you a little differently you ' ve been out two and half years now , it ' s not one year that ' s my only discouragement . "
