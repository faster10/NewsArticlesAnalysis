Raonic is off to a great start this year he has won all of his eight matches , including the final in Brisbane against Roger Federer but hasn ' t had nearly the success Curry has enjoyed in the past year . While Raonic did rise as high as No . 4 in the rankings last May , he also suffered a foot injury that sidelined him from a number of tournaments , including the French Open . He eventually fell to No . 14 . The injury often left him depressed , but it also helped because it gave him time to consider working on improving different aspects of his game .
