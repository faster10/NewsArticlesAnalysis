Denver will cover Carolina ' s wideouts . The Broncos are formidable up front defensively , Wade Phillips is outstanding as a coordinator , they are good in the secondary . The only holes line up with the two things Carolina can do . One is Cam Newton ' s ability to run . Denver had some issues with Alex Smith picking up key third down conversions . Cam can do that . The other matchup is Greg Olsen against Denver ' s safeties , who are very average to me . Their corners are special and I would not be surprised to see them match one of their better corners on Olsen .
