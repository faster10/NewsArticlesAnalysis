Here ' s how Google explained the omission in November : " We try to cover as many streets as possible but occasionally we miss the odd one or two for example there may have been road work that day , a street may have been inaccessible or simply because of human error our drivers may have missed a street , " a spokeswoman said in an email to me . " It ' s also possible that we did drive a certain street , but discovered that when processing the imagery , the photographs collected did not meet our high quality imagery standards due to unforeseeable challenges like shadows , poor visibility conditions , etc . Hopefully we can come back and photograph it at a future date . "
