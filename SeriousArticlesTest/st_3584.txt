But a lower level doesn ' t mean it ' s safe to be here long . We stop in a neighborhood to check the radiation . On the pavement , the surface reads a radiation level of 0 . 042 millisieverts per hour , which is 10 times what you ' re exposed to in a dental x ray . Not a significant problem since we ' re in the exclusion zone for a short visit and wearing protective suits . But living on this street carries possible long term health risks , especially for children .
