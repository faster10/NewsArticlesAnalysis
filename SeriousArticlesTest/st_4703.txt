One of the first high profile writers to put his foot down is SI MMQB s Peter King , who published an open letter to NFL players on Tuesday . Just seeing the words open letter instantly makes you smell sanctimony , and this one reeks . In a sport that can t seem to grow out of the violent tendencies of its dirtiest players , who continue to play with disregard for long term mental health , something has to be done and the words King wrote today have to be said ? but from him ?
