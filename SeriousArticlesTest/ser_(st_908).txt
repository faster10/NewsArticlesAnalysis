To be sure , some fans have behaved in a shockingly racist way over the decades . In the 1960s , when black players were a rarer sight , two black players for West Ham United , Clyde Best and Ade Coker , were the victims of monkey chants and banana throwing . As late as the 1980s , bananas were thrown at black players : In one infamous photo from 1987 , black Liverpool player John Barnes could be seen kicking off the field a banana that had been hurled at him . Yet it is rare indeed to read newspaper reports of such behavior today .
