De Waal : Well , I think that morality is older . In the sense that I find it very hard to believe that 100 , 000 or 200 , 000 years ago , our ancestors did not believe in right and wrong , and did not punish bad behavior , did not care about fairness . Very long ago our ancestors had moral systems . Our current institutions are only a couple of thousand years old , which is really not old in the eyes of a biologist . So I think religion came after morality . Religion may have become a codification of morality , and it may fortify it , but it ' s not the origin of it .
