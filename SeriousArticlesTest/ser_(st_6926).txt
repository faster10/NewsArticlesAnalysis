To start the GST in 2016 , Modi needs parliament to act quickly . Both houses must approve the tax , but the BJP controls only the lower one . The upper house is dominated by the BJP s opponents . This is legislation almost every politician , bureaucrat , and party fundamentally agrees on , says S . L . Rao , former chairman of the Institute of Social and Economic Change in Bangalore . Yet non BJP politicians aren t keen to pass legislation that gives Modi a victory . The BJP blames the rival Congress party for blocking passage of the law . The Congress strategy was to disturb the house and not allow it to function , says Finance Minister Arun Jaitley .
