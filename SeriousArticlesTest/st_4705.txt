I believe that the only way to convey a message of safety to the players is to deliver it with a former player . Even better , one that didn t play with regard to safety ( read : most NFL players ever ) , and is now paying the price . Post it on the Players Tribune , a . k . a . the Voice of the Game . Slap a suit on him and put him on Outside the Lines and Inside The NFL . Active players might listen at that point .
