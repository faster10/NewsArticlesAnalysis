I ' m always amazed when I see comments like these . People are pretty worked up over the growth of the Latino community and the role that immigration played in fueling it . Many of them can talk your ear off about that . And yet , not many of them seem to know any flesh and blood Latinos . If they did , they would know how ridiculous it is to treat U . S . citizens and illegal immigrants as if they are one and the same . Besides , they seem to put a lot of stock in what it means to be an American . So shouldn ' t they be able to recognize Americans when they see them ?
