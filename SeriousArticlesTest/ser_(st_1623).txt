Goodacre : That ' s a good question . There is actually nothing in second century writers that says that Jesus was married and Clement of Alexandria ( died 215 AD ) takes for granted that Jesus was not married . When the " Gospel of Jesus ' Wife " was published in 2012 , it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of Jesus being married from as early as the second century , but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery .
