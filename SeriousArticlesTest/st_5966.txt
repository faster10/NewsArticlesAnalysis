Davis suffered the injury ? a broken right forearm ? in the second quarter of the Panthers victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Sunday night s NFC championship game after a collision with Darren Fells . It hurt . It was painful , Davis said . At the same time I believe in our training staff and I believe in the process . If it is at all possible I know they are going to get me back and I will do my part to make sure I m ready .
