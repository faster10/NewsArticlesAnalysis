Royals : Salvador Perez . The big catcher earned his third straight All Star nod and should be a favorite for his third Gold Glove in a row , too .

He also connected twice in the Division Series and has six RBIs overall . Remember , too , he homered off Giants ace Madison Bumgarner in the World Series opener last fall .
