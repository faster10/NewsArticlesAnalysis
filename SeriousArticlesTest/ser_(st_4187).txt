Syria : On the American air war against ISIS in Syria , where the terror group makes its headquarters , Obama warned against escalation . That s a recipe for quagmire , spilling American blood and treasure , Obama said . It s the lesson of Vietnam , of Iraq ? and we should have learned it by now . But Obama faces a chorus of calls to intervene more assertively , from Republican presidential candidates and from Syrian activists seeking a conclusion to the nearly five year civil war there . Obama said Tuesday that on issues like Syria the US will mobilize allies and make sure other countries pull their own weight . And while he didn t name names , Obama also managed to squeeze in a thinly veiled dig at Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz , who has vowed on the campaign trail to carpet bomb ISIS . That may work as a TV sound bite , but it doesn t pass muster on the world stage , Obama said .
