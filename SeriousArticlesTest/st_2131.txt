VIKINGS 1 . 5 VS . SEAHAWKS : We ' ve picked the Vikings a ton this season and we ' re not going to stop now on a week when they ' re actually getting points at home . Minnesota doesn ' t get a ton of attention , but its defense is much better than Seattle ' s . QB Teddy Bridgewater hasn ' t played as well as you ' d like over the past few weeks , but RB Adrian Peterson is rolling over the past six weeks . One more nugget to consider : The Vikings are 7 2 1 against the spread in its last 10 games at home . This will be the game where Minnesota sends a message to the NFL that it will be dangerous in the playoffs .
