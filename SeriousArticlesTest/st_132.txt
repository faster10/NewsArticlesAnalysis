Paul Ryan to support budget deal : Finally , Speaker to be Paul Ryan issued a statement this morning saying that he will support the budget deal that outgoing Speaker John Boehner struck with the White House and congressional Democrats . " As with any budget agreement , this one has some good , some bad , and some ugly . It does include meaningful reforms to strengthen our safety net programs , including significant changes to bolster Social Security . It would allow us to return to regular order in our budget process . And it would mean our men and women in uniform have the resources they need to carry out their mission What has been produced will go a long way toward relieving the uncertainty hanging over us , and that ' s why I intend to support it . " Ryan ' s support makes sense : He has to keep the folks who take the tough votes in line . But how will the Freedom Caucus react ?
