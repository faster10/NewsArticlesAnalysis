That all changed in 1972 when Bowie dreamed up an intergalactic alter ego named Ziggy Stardust , whom he introduced on the album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars . One of the first ? and most important ? concept albums in rock roll , Ziggy told the tale of an Earth on the brink of Armageddon and the interstellar rock god sent to save it . The album also paved the way for future generations of androgynous , gender bending icons in pop . He was emaciated , he had bright orange hair and silver lipstick and no eyebrows , and he looked fantastic , the Cure s Robert Smith told EW in 1997 . The potency of the image was so strong that the next day at school everyone was saying , Did you see Bowie on Top of the Pops ?
