So what was at stake ? Primacy in the Big 12 , for one . The No . 1 ranking in the country , that s another . And more than that . Because the last time Oklahoma had won at Allen Fieldhouse was Feb . 17 , 1993 . That was 10 months before Buddy Hield was born . In his 12 plus seasons at Kansas , Bill Self has lost only nine home games . Meanwhile , he s won 11 Big 12 championships . For Oklahoma to pull off the upset would have indicated a possible changing of the guard , at least for one season , in the Jayhawk ruled Big 12 .
