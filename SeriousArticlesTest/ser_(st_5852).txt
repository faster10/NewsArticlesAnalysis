Golden State slipped behind the Michael Jordan led Bulls with a loss at Detroit on Jan . 16 but responded with five straight wins over the likes of Cleveland , Chicago , Indiana , San Antonio and Dallas by an average of 25 . 4 points . Shooting guard Klay Thompson and forward Draymond Green both received well deserved All Star nods on Thursday , joining MVP Stephen Curry to make a trio of Warriors headed to Toronto next month . The 76ers are at the complete opposite end of the spectrum with no All Stars and the worst record in the NBA . Philadelphia seems to be putting together a better stretch of late and has alternated wins and losses over the last six contests , including a 113 103 triumph over Phoenix in its last home game .
