" According to its website , Southwest Airlines requires customers who do not fit in their seats ( which are 17 inches wide ) to purchase an extra seat before boarding , but will refund them for the seat if the flight is not full . AirTran , which is being purchased by Southwest , has the same policy . Continental and United require passengers to be able to lower their armrests and fasten their seat belt with no more than one seat belt extender . Delta requires that passengers lower their armrests and fasten their seat belt with no extenders . Passengers may be required to purchase an additional seat if they fall outside of this protocol .
