I ' m firmly on the under in this game . Both defenses are fantastic and while both offenses can put up points , I don ' t think the strength of either matches up well with the opposing defense . I ' ll double up on a total under with a pair of team under plays . Alabama ' s offense torched Michigan State through the air , but the Tigers have much better players in the secondary and big plays won ' t be as easy to come by for the Tide . I think Alabama lands in the low to mid 20s in this one , coming in under this number .
