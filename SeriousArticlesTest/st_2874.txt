How can it be part of the necessary expenses in carrying out MPs ' duties , they ask , to charge for children ' s buggies and the eradication of moles from their country lawns ? Just how many have been paying inflated " rents " to close relatives or claiming the " additional costs allowance " for second homes they do not actually inhabit on more than token occasions ? Why should it be legal for ministers who live in " grace and favor " apartments ( where they are allowed to live for free ) to claim additional costs allowances for properties they are meanwhile renting out ?
