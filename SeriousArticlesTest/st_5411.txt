6 . The film : Almost Famous , Cameron Crowe ( 2000 ) The song : Tiny Dancer , Elton John The scene : On the tourbus the band sing along to Tiny Dancer 1960 ' s rockers , Stillwater , are stuck on the tour bus . No one is talking and the tension is palpable . " Tiny Dancer " comes on the radio and slowly one by one they start singing along . Everyone grins and tensions drain away . Touching without being cheesy , this scene is full of nostalgia for good times had with friends and will stay with you long after watching the film .
