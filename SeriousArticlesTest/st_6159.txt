I m going to repeat what every poster said during the Norman ODB mess . Their just words , don t lose your cool . First we don t have evidence of porter saying or doing anything . What we do see , is burfict with a handful of porters jacket , porter standing there semi laughing as if to say please fool then Jones losing it shoving a ref and taking a swing at porter . Go back and watch a dozen games this year and you will see on multiple occasions where a player was hurt and players from the bench as well as assistant coaches are on the field . Stop pointing the blame at the refs , the rain , your own head coach and man up and accept that 2 hour up of control players , burfict and jones lost their composure at the worst possible time .
