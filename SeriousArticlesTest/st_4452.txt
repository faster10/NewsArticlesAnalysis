Though wall chalking and pamphlets in support of IS in various cities in Pakistan have been showing up since 2014 , two recent incidents in Karachi indicate more support for the group . The vice chancellor of a private university is being held on charges of material support to IS and a group of 20 influential women was arrested by the Counter Terrorism Department ( CTD ) in Karachi , who are said to be the financiers for the group . The accused were behind the Safoora carnage in which 46 Ismailis were ruthlessly massacred on a bus in May 2015 . Reports have started to pour in from all major urban centres of the country about active recruitment for the group . The latest revelation came out on December 27 that the CTD had busted an IS cell in Sialkot and , according to investigators , the eight operatives arrested from the cell had vowed to overthrow democracy and introduce khilafat in Pakistan through armed struggle .
