I want to talk about construction and reconstruction at the same time . Haitian soccer has existed for more than 100 years . Soccer is a tradition deeply involved in the culture , the life of the country . The misery of the country affected its international evolvement but not its creativity , its popularity , its power and national weight . In this domain , with no doubt , everything exists , we will have to motivate sensibly , because the human factor exists in order to create an elite of players , to allow young talents to use soccer to get out of the misery , with the goal of obtaining a major professional contract and bringing money back to the country , or attending school abroad .
