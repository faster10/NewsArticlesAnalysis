The Bengals enter the postseason with a major question mark surrounding quarterback Andy Dalton . He missed the season ' s final three games with a thumb injury and doesn ' t appear likely for the Wild Card Round . He ' s only just now preparing to get the cast off his hand , which makes the probability low that he ' d be able to practice fully and be prepared . Cincinnati is 2 1 in games started by AJ McCarron but hasn ' t scored more than 24 points with him at the helm .
