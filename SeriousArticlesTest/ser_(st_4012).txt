KOCHHAR : Right . So if we have fewer people in the middle , the question is , where are they moving to ? And we find they ' re moved both to the low end of the income distribution and to the high end of the income distribution . But when we take a deeper look within the lower end , we find that they are moving to the lowest end of the income distribution . And then when we take a deeper look at the upper end , we find that they ' re moving to the very top end of the income distribution . So the movement out of the middle is not just to the margins but to the farthest edges of the income distribution . In other words , there ' s a deeper polarization underway in the American economy .
