Google , like Facebook , owns trillions if not quadrillions plus bits of information . They mine it , use it to sell ads , algorithm it . But my real fear is not Google . My real fear is that computer technology has turned into an arms race between good guys and bad guys . Google may see itself as a jaunty white hat wearer , valiantly protecting all our information . And it may be doing it to the best of its ability . But hackers are hard at work all the time .
