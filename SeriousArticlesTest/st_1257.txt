Lyrically , there s a lot of songs that are influenced by my wife . They re about my wife and I . Hotel Rio is about my wife and I , but it s also sort of a fictitious sort of story . As I ve gotten older and my life is a lot more stable , I ve gotten more into storytelling . I ve listened to a lot of Dylan and listened to how he wrote stories . So I took a lot of influence from that and applied it to my own process of writing and my own style of writing . I ve gotten more into storytelling . On my earlier albums , the lyrics were about my feelings of being down or my apathy , and I don t feel that way any more . It s been a long time . So I am more into storytelling . Being off of heroin for almost 15 years , it definitely changes things . It s opened up my writing a lot .
