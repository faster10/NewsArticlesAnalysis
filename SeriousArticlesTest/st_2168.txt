The downsides are more insidious . First , although policy reform , meaning free market based pricing would be easier to implement under circumstances when prices are low , the compulsion is less . It is quite likely that kerosene will continue to be subsidised and so will fertilisers ( which are petrochem based ) . Second , there will be less enthusiasm for creating solar and wind based power capacities if coal , gas and naptha remain cheap . Third , there will be less investment into the exploration and production sector while prices remain low . There will also be less incentive for the government to rejig the NELP , which is supposed to move through multiple policy changes .
