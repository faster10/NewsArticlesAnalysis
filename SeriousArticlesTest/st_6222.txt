Said Olynyk of the late game looks : " I had one at the end of regulation . That was a good shot I had to get off quick obviously with 0 . 7 or whatever on the clock . I obviously missed it . I thought Isaiah got a great floater at the end of one of them . Evan got a great look . And that three by Jae , that was a makeable shot . They re all great looks . We ve just got to knock them down . "
