Landry Jones : Quarterback Jones wasn t awful , and his second interception wasn t his fault , but he couldn t get much going despite elite weapons around him . Jones couldn ' t bottle the two touchdown momentum from last week . Jones had a 24 . 1 passer rating through his first 18 passes . He finished 16 of 29 for 209 yards , one touchdown ( a beautiful fade to Martavis Bryant ) and three turnovers . Decent performance but the turnovers place him in the " down " category .
