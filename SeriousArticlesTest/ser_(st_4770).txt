My second piece of advice is that after you have remained strong you must now persevere . Keep continuing to participate in your sociology class discussions even though that one kid keeps calling the diversity initiatives on campus a " white genocide " and even though his frat bro came to his defense by asking you why there is no " White Entertainment TV ? " Register for that political science course that is taught by that one professor who told you in astonishment , " I didn ' t think someone like you would make it in my class . " Take that route home from the bars even though that same cop continues to ask , " do you go here ? " And don ' t forget to apply for that once in a lifetime school sponsored internship in LA offered by that department chair who told you he was " uncomfortable " around you during your interview , and when you confronted him he repeatedly called you Jerome Jones even though that is nothing close to your name . Continue to date even though your long time crush just confessed to you that her dad doesn ' t allow for her to date black guys .
