Can that not be that , please ? The mainstream political media has such a pathological dedication to the notion of balance and objectivity that it often finds itself at a complete loss when it comes to dealing with someone like Trump . But the kind of filth that he and others are putting out has long since moved past the debatable stage . There is an Islamophobic crisis building in this country . To oppose discrimination against Muslims is not to take some partisan stand . It s to be a human being . To oppose a prominent political figure s use of fascistic slander toward black people is not to shirk your objectivity . It s the least the elite media should be doing .
