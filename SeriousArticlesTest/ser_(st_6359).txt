Royals : The starting staff is the weakest aspect of the sound Royals . Yordano Ventura became a star during last year ' s postseason and was the team ' s opening day starter , but the flame thrower struggled with his control and emotions and was briefly demoted to the minors this season . He ' s been inconsistent in October , brilliant at times and beatable at others . Free agent signee Edinson Volquez had his second 13 win season in a row , after one with Pittsburgh . Volquez tossed six shutout innings in the ALCS opener , then fell apart in the sixth inning of a Game 5 loss . The big trade deadline arrival , Johnny Cueto , has been perplexing . He was 4 7 with a 4 . 76 ERA in 13 starts for Kansas City , then went out and was nearly untouchable in the deciding Game 5 of the Division Series vs . Houston before having one of the worst starts of his career in Game 3 of the ALCS . Chris Young , the 6 foot 10 Princeton grad , got the call in Game 4 after a long layoff and was superb for 4 2 3 innings .
