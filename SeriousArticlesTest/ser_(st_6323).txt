You ' re right , one of the reasons we have separate men and women bathrooms is the potential for violence . But another reason is due to the discomfort of being checked out by someone who could be attracted to you . No honest straight man can say if he was put in a locker room full of naked ladies he wouldn ' t check out one , a few , or all of the women . It wouldn ' t be creepy , it wouldn ' t be deviant it would be normal . And no one would suggest in that situation : Get over yourselves ladies , don ' t be so narcissistic , your discomfort is your problem .
