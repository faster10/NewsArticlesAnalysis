Little is publicly known about the full scope of the FBI ' s activities . Much of it is shrouded in secrecy . But we do know that , according to one former senior FBI counterterrorism official , the FBI conducted nearly 500 , 000 interviews of Muslim and Arab males from 2001 2005 , and not a single one of those interviews led to information that would have allowed the government to detect or prevent the 9 11 attacks . Think about that : For every hour an agent spent talking to someone who had nothing to do with terrorism , that was one hour less spent tracking down a real threat , in this case at least 500 , 000 hours in four years alone not spent on actual criminals .
