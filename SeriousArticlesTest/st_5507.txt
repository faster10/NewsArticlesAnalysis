That s their choice . What would it mean ? I was blessed to talk to Tom a few weeks ago , just out of the blue . I just wanted to give him a call and see how his wine was doing . He s a special guy . He s a special player in the history of this game . And so , obviously , to be in the same Hall as Tom Seaver is an honor . So anything from here on out would be just complete icing on top of the icing . I m not assuming anything , but Tommy is great . And the one thing about the Mets is just the unique connection the fans do have with the history of the game .
