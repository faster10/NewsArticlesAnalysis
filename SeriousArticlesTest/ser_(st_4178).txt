Keep this stat in mind : Kirk Cousins finished 2015 with more touchdown passes and yards than Aaron Rodgers . He also had a better passer rating , completion percentage and yards per attempt . If you would have given me 200 1 odds on that before the season , I wouldn ' t have taken it . Or at the very least I would have believed Rodgers suffered a catastrophic injury . Or was hit by a bus . Or had his talent sucked out of him Monstars style . ( Which can ' t be totally discounted at this point but still . )
