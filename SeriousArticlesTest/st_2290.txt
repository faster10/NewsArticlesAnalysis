Palin being Palin , her own family undermined her political return , as back in Alaska her son Track at almost the same time Sarah appeared on stage reportedly hit his girlfriend in the face and then threatened to commit suicide with one of the numerous firearms lying about the Palin residence ( he lives with his mom ) . Palin responded in true pitbull fashion , and blamed Track ' s troubles on ( you betcha ! ) President Obama . Her reasoning , as always , was insane . Even though the Palin family is wildly wealthy from successfully grifting the rubes for eight solid years , Track ' s mental problems must be Obama ' s fault , for not " supporting the veterans " with post traumatic stress disorder . So Palin is arguing for more government spending for a family that could easily have paid for mental health treatment on its own , but chose not to . Track ' s 0 . 189 blood alcohol level wasn ' t mentioned by mom , of course . Ah , the Palins ! How we ' ve all missed you !
