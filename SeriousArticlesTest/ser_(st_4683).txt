Marino : I did a lot of teacher trainings . I was studying Iyengar Yoga , and I just resisted teaching as much as I loved it . A friend of mine was teaching at a gym in Hollywood , and he said there were like three students that came . It was in an air conditioned room at seven in the morning . He said , " I ' m going away . Will you please teach for me ? " I said , " Absolutely not . I will not . Cannot . " He said , " I ' m going away . You have to teach for me . " So I went and did it .
