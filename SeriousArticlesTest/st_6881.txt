The 20 year old Parker , whom the Bucks took with the No . 2 overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft , missed the first four games of the season while working his way back from the torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee that he suffered last December . He returned against the Philadelphia 76ers on Nov . 4 , playing just 16 minutes as he and the Bucks stuck to the slow and steady reintegration plan set forth by Robert Altchek , the surgeon who operated on Parker ' s knee , and Bucks strength and conditioning coach Suki Hobson .
