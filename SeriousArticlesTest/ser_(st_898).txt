" God is light and in him there is no darkness at all . Yet on the part of the people , there are times of both light and darkness , fidelity and infidelity , obedience and rebellion , times of being a pilgrim people , and times of being a people adrift , " the Pope said . " In our personal history , too , there are both bright and dark moments , lights and shadows . If we love God and our brothers and sisters , we walk in the light . But if our heart is closed , if we are dominated by pride , deceit , self seeking , then darkness falls within us , and around us . Whoever hates his brother writes the Apostle John is in the darkness he walks in the darkness , and does not know the way to go , because the darkness has blinded his eyes . "
