Farrell : Socially , we ' ve never really hung out , although these days , I ' m inviting the guys to things that I do just because I love ' em . But we definitely go to different parts of the universe . Some bands , they all have to like the same thing , and as a result , the sound is very linear , and once the time passes , they sound dated . When it comes to our prescription , we like to have different elements of music and influence coming together . That ' s what makes a new sound .
