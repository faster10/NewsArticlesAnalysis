I still believe that few states will choose to refuse the expansion money . It ' s hard to say no to a full funding of insurance for millions of constituents when it will cost you nothing . Moreover , it will be politically difficult to say no when so many other states are saying yes . There will also be enormous pressure from physicians , hospitals and other providers , who stand to lose a ton of money if people aren ' t insured . Let ' s remember that there were holdouts when Medicaid was passed decades ago . Today , threatening to take away that program is " coercive . "
