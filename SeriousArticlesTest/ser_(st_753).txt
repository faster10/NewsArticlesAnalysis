That s the attack part . Do you think Sanders is saying it s unfair to take money from big banks and then regulate the heck out of them ? Or that you shouldn t take their money in the first place ? Probably the latter , but it s not exactly an attention grabber when Republicans are running spots calling each other a bully or a jerk . ( Both of those were aimed at Donald Trump , and I believe I speak for much of the nation when I say , Why not ? )
