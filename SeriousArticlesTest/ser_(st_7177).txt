" The Taliban , those of whom who are Afghans and the sons of Afghan soil , who have been driven to violence by various factors beyond their control and beyond ours caused by circumstances in Afghanistan , we want them to come back to their country , " Karzai said . " They are like kids who have run away . . . from the family . The family should try to bring them back and give them better discipline and incorporate them back into their family and society . President Rabbani assuming chairmanship today of the peace council is exactly in that spirit . "
