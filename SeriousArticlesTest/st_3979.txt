I watched the steady hand of my first officer , Jim , advance the thrust levers of our Boeing 777 . With the assistance of 115 , 000 ponds of thrust from each of two GE engines , the airplane began its lumbered roll down the center line of Runway 22 Left at JFK . We accelerated toward a rotation speed of 153 knots . At rotation speed , Jim applied gentle pressure to the control yoke , lifting the nose of our 602 , 000 pound airplane skyward . This would be one of the most critical phases of our flight to London .
