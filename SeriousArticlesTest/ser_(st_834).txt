" The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn Part 1 " ( Geez , typing that whole title never gets any easier . I half expect the next installment to be renamed " The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn Part 2 : The Finale 2 Love or 2 Die " ) grossed 62 . 3 million over the Wednesday to Sunday period , with 42 million of that coming in over the regular three day frame . That gives the vampire drama a ten day total of 221 . 3 million , ahead of the 214 . 3 million " Eclipse " had earned at the same point in its run .
