Sanders weathered Clinton s attacks competently enough , but he remains curiously opaque on foreign policy . It s bizarre that , after all this time , he still flounders around so much when asked about the wider world . For one thing , you should be prepared for this stuff . But more importantly , foreign policy is much more in the president s control than domestic policy . President Obama has been able to conduct a massive drone campaign , launch multiple wars and negotiate deals with Iran and Cuba with virtually no Congressional input whatsoever . In fact , his foreign policy has been one of the most deeply un progressive aspects of his entire presidency .
