Royals : Wade Davis showed in that nerve racking ninth inning of ALCS Game 6 that he has the stomach and the stuff of a top closer . Previously a stellar setup man , Davis stepped in last month to replace Greg Holland , who had Tommy John surgery . And with the return of Luke Hochevar from elbow surgery and the addition of reclamation project Ryan Madson , the Royals ' beast of a bullpen might be just as good as last year ' s crew . Kelvin Herrera , Davis and Hochevar were unscored upon against Toronto . Danny Duffy and Franklin Morales are the left handers who could be called on to contain New York ' s dangerous left handed hitters .
