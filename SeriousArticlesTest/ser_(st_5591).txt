Europol has been able to ascertain that some of the missing migrant children are being used as child labor in some European countries . In Turkey , a huge increase can be seen in the child labor force . Turkey has taken in over a million refugees from Syria . Most of them are not able to work in Turkey due to Turkey sparingly handing out work permits to Syrians who have skills that are considered to be highly skilled . With many of the refugees not being allowed to work , the burden falls on the refugee children , who get paid far less than adults would . Up to 400 , 000 children are forced out of receiving their education in order to be used as child labor .
