Sympathy is a bit more complicated . Sympathy is that you want to take action . You want to help somebody else who ' s in trouble . So sympathy is a bit more specific , it ' s a bit more action oriented . Empathy is just a sensitivity . Empathy is not necessarily positive . If someone wants to sell you a bad car for a high price , he also needs to empathize with you in order to get you to buy it . So empathy can be used for good purposes I think most of the time it is , but it is not always used for good purposes .
