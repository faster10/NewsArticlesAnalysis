Unconditional Love : Campaigning is hard work . Lots of people say mean things , challenge your beliefs and assumptions , and even expect you to give them pragmatic answers to everyday problems whose solutions are contrary to your political agenda of enriching the top 1 percent by any means necessary . The last thing our candidates need is to feel negative energy or unsupported . It is therefore important that all participating moderators do their darndest to make each individual candidate feel cared for , special and unconditionally loved at all times . Warm smiles , ingratiating laughs , encouraging pats on the back and pre debate hugs and snuggles are more than welcome .
