" Anytime I ' m out and about and people ask me what I do , I say , ' Oh I make the movies for the Syfy Channel , ' and people are like , ' Oh ! I love those things ! ' Anyone from a hairdresser to a guy in a grocery store , guy parking the car . I think it ' s really a wide spectrum of viewers for these movies , and I think the age range also varies very much , too . "
