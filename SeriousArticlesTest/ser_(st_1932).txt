( On if there is anything the team needs to address personnel wise : ) Really like our team . Yeah , there s some stuff , there s always stuff , but I really like our team . I like the balance of it . I like the youth of it . The attitude , the mentality , the toughness , but it needs to be more competitive in a number of spots . So that s what the draft will do . That s what putting the roster together will do . I m not able at this time to talk to you about any individual guys because it s today , it s Monday , we don t know anything yet , how we re going to get through all of this . But we have issues , like we do every season . There s difficult decisions that we ll have to make , and we ll make them , and we ll move forward in hopes of making our roster more competitive . There s a lot of guys on this roster right now , the young guys that you don t know a lot about , that I think have a chance to really push other guys that are on our team right now . It s an exciting group of young athletes , and speed , and mentality , and stuff that will have a chance to maybe give us a boost . So that s part of it , and then the draft , and whatever else we can do there , will also fit in . Then we ll come back and try to make this the most competitive camp we ve ever had , and see what that leaves us with . I think that s going to leave us with a pretty strong group . But we have some areas that we want to work on for sure .
