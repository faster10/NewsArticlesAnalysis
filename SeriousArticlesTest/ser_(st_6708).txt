THE ARGUMENT : We re seeing the Washington establishment abandoning Marco Rubio ? I think they ve made the determination that Marco can t win , and they re rushing to support Donald Trump , Cruz said . And just yesterday Bob Dole explained why the establishment is supporting Donald Trump . They say he s someone we can make a deal with , he continued . So if as a voter you think what we need is more Republicans in Washington to cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer , then I guess Donald Trump s your guy .
