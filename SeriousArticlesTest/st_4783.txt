Moving Dez to the slot makes a lot of sense , though , for sure . As you well know , Norman ' s given up three receptions and a touchdown on three targets in the slot per PFF . I think the ideal situation for Carolina would be to leave Norman on Terrance Williams in those instances and double Dez with Bene Benwikere or Charles Tillman if he ' s healthy enough to play and a safety . We ' re definitely going to see Dez there he ' s got a pair of scores from the slot this year .
