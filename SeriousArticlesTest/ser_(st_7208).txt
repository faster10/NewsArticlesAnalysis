The running back was tired of talking , and who can blame him ? The party beckoned , and then the Super Bowl , and he s been singing Newton s praises for months . What more is there to add ? Even talking about the best must sometimes get old . Newton s stat line Sunday ? 19 of 28 for 335 yards , two touchdown passes and two rushing touchdowns ? has become par for the course here , par for a season that was one score short of perfection . Even blowing out one of the NFL s best teams in the conference championship game seemed , if not expected , then at least understandable . He s just that good . They re just this good .
