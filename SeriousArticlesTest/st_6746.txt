Labor force participation : It ticked up a point , to 62 . 5 but is still 3 . 5 percentage points below its 66 peak way back before the downturn . Maybe 2 of those points can be ascribed to retiring boomers , but that leaves 1 . 5 of the labor force over 2 million people missing in action , i . e . , not counted in the jobless rate because they ' re not looking for work ( some are picked up in U6 but most probably aren ' t ) .
