On record , James Murphy s genius got given consistent , clinical write ups in the music press . But it was the live shows in the last decade , which got progressively better , beefier , to their most dementedly happy point before the band decided to bury themselves , that allowed LCD to transcend arch , knowing acclaim to becoming ? sorry ? a sentimentalised cornerstone of contemporary pop culture . Where can they go from that now ? Well , shut up and play the hits . Nosheen Iqbal
