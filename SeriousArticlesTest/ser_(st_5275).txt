" I ' m excited , I ' m not nervous , " Salim Akil said . " I think when I feel like I ' ve done my job and I ' ve respected the audience and respected the material , there ' s no reason to be nervous . I don ' t read reviews so I don ' t go down that road . So I ' m just excited . I ' m excited for all of the actors . I ' m excited for people to see Whitney . I want them to see her , how beautiful she is and what a wonderful actress she is . This is the closest I think I ' ll come to giving birth . "
