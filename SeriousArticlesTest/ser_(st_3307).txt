I am not privy to what sort of security arrangements go into planning the Boston Marathon , but there ' s only so much you can do along a 26 . 2 mile route that passes through seven cities and towns in addition to Boston . As I write this , there is some speculation that bombs may have been placed in trash cans . That may or may not prove to be accurate , but can you imagine securing every trash can , every manhole , every nook and cranny from Hopkinton to Boston ?
