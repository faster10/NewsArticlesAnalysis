While in the short run privatising Eurostar , Royal Mail , RBS or the Green Investment Bank might reduce government assets , and hence expenditure ( making the deficit look artificially low ) , there have been no proper studies showing the long term costs of such sales . The effect of the latest Eurostar sale may be to increase public debt as the state loses out on future dividends . Paradoxically , because the UK is so allergic to industrial strategy , it has started outsourcing strategy to other states ? hence the recent decision to sell off public assets to long termist China . It s almost as if the anti state ideology only applies to the UK s public sector .
