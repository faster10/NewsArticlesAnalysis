The most pressing concern now , according to Holmes , is the fact that over 100 , 000 people are currently crowded in a " very small pocket of land " that is about five square miles , or about twice the size of New York ' s Central Park . " It is a very small area indeed for what we believe is very large number of people " Holmes explained . The crowded population , primarily comprised of Tamil civilians , is subject to the continuing Sri Lankan government assaults .
