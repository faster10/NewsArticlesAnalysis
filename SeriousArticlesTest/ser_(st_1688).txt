Maybe it would be easier to vote for Hillary Clinton if she wasn ' t such an insistently unconvincing liar . Bill Clinton used lies the way Van Gogh used yellow , to intensify and transcend reality .

Most Sanders ' supporters , armed with facts but not hip waders , are forced to back slowly away from her speeches lest the rising effluent suck them down to the cretinous levels of centrists , neoliberals , and Joan Walsh .
