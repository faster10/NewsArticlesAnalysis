( An aside : Mason s steal was one of the many questionable calls , or in this case , non calls , in this game . As plenty of people pointed out on Twitter , Mason was standing too close to Hield as Hield inbounded the ball . " Right before the play started the ref told me not to get close to the line , " Mason said . " But after he handed the ball in , there was nothing he could do . So I took a step closer and went all out on the deny . I got a deflection and the steal . " But a little end game controversy makes a great game even better , doesn t it ? )
