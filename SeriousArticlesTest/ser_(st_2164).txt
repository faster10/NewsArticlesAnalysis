NQ : I think governments now do understand for most governments it ' s important . They may not know what they want to do with it , but they understand it ' s very important . That sometimes explains why government actions are seen as not coordinated or erratic , because they think it ' s very important but they yet don ' t have a full , sufficient understanding to know exactly how they want to interact with it or manage it or grow it . But certainly they recognize it is very important and many in governments are engaging with the internet technical community and other multi stakeholder organizations to support them to evolve .
