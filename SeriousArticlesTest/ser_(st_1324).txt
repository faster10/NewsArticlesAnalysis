The biggest problem the Cavs have had offensively is finding the balance of weapons after LeBron in the hierarchy . Some say Kyrie needs to defer to Love more and let him get involved . Others say Irving is the clear No . 2 option on the team and Love needs to find ways to contribute like Chris Bosh did in Miami when LeBron signed there . But the message that LeBron eats first and then everybody eats second is loud and clear . If Irving and Love can focus more on the team and less on individual success , it does create a better team culture .
