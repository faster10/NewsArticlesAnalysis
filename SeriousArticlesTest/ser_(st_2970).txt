Billion : We can discuss democratic rights , we can discuss curtailment of freedoms . It must be done . Things must not be manipulated . Some people , for instance , say we should break off all relations with Turkey because there are these attacks on human rights . I think that position is totally wrong . It is because there are such attacks that a dialogue worthy of the name must be pursued and relaunched . But we can t have a moral position with regards to Turkey . There must be a political reasoning . That means restarting partnerships , relaunching the negotiation and in that context addressing all questions . I am very worried about the policy that the president of the republic , Mr Erdogan , moved along by getting good economic results in the past few years . He put Turkey on the international map with a lot of positive initiatives for mediation , and so on . Unfortunately , what a waste . Today , Erdogan s rationale is one of confrontation , polarisation , political positioning according to a strategy of tension , and evidently Turkey today is going through a bad time .
