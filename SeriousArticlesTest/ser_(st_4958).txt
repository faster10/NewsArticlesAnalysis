Like many Cantabs , my mind is haunted with the apocalyptic scenes of our devastated city . I am sick to the pit of my stomach at the wrenching loss of life and casualty toll . Why did so many modern buildings implode ? In hindsight , were we too impatient and " she ' ll be right " in agitating for the city center to return to " business as usual " so soon ? How long should it be closed for now ? What will it take before people trust our city center , and feel safe in the buildings that remain ? How many people will trust the land they have lived and worked on ?
