Conference USA Championship : Southern Miss vs . Western Kentucky ( 7 . 5 ) : This game would be way more fun to play with a pick on the over ( 72 ) and root for touchdowns from the two most potent offenses in the league . Western Kentucky and Southern Miss each average over 500 yards per game and average more than seven yards per play , so I think I ' d take the over on anything under 80 . It ' s awesome to see Southern Miss back in contention after a tough couple seasons for Todd Monken , but I think WKU gets the win here , close . Pick : Golden Eagles 7 . 5
