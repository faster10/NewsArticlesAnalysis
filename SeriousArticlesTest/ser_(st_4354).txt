Olsen had his second playoff game in a row with quality stats , and he had eight targets against the Cardinals , which was a team high . In last week ' s victory against the Seahawks , Olsen had six catches for 77 yards and a touchdown on six targets . He is closing out the postseason the way he played all year when he had 77 catches for 1 , 104 yards and seven touchdowns on 124 targets . That left him tied with Reed for the No . 2 tight end in standard leagues behind Gronkowski , and it ' s the second year in a row Olsen had at least 77 catches , 1 , 000 yards and six touchdowns . He had 84 catches for 1 , 008 yards and six touchdowns in 2014 , his lone year playing with Benjamin , and that should be considered his floor entering 2016 . Benjamin is going to take away production from Olsen , but he should still be drafted as a Top 3 tight end in all leagues . After Gronkowski , the choice will likely be Olsen or Reed . I like Reed ' s upside a little more , but Olsen as a safe alternative . You know what you ' re getting , and he should continue to deliver in a big way . He ' s worth drafting by Round 4 in the majority of leagues .
