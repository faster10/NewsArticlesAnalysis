Mexico s film industry has churned out narco peliculas since the 1980s , when the low budget movies were on VHS rather than DVD . Today , movies are still often shot in less than two weeks , featuring real life desperadoes , strippers and guns in stories that flick between scantily clad women and firefights in monster trucks . With names such as The Hummer , Narco War and Massive Extinction , they can inspire up to seven sequels . The down to earth style of the movies is extremely popular in the ramshackle Mexican villages and rough barrios that many traffickers hail from , as well as in migrant communities in the United States . Many of the films have been put onto Youtube , where they win millions of views .
