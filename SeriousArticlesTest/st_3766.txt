Cornwell : When I was shopping my first book around , it was rejected by the major publishing houses and that was because a lot of people didn ' t think morgues and labs were interesting , and that ' s a huge statement about how things have changed . I remember one time , I called my literary agent at that time , and I said I was in a toxicology lab , and she said , I hate talking to you because you ' re always in these awful places . Forensic science was not viewed as cool , as it is today .
