According to Davis , up and coming actors like Creed star Michael B . Jordan and Beasts of No Nation actor Abraham Attah are still relatively unknown to most Oscar voters , who view someone like best actor nominee Leonardo DiCaprio as a peer . Jason Mitchell who played the late Eazy E in Straight Outta Compton is a nobody to all these people , and in my opinion he gave the performance of any person in 2015 , said Davis . He also thinks so so reviews sidetracked Will Smith s campaign for Concussion and an anti Netflix bias may have hurt Idris Elba s chances of breaking into the best supporting actor race for Beasts of No Nation .
