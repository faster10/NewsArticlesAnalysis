It worked : Rodgers was by no means great he missed a few open receivers , he had more incompletions than completions but the entire game , you felt like he was in control , and he was sacked only twice . Crosby nailed all five of his field goal attempts , including a 52 yarder . Jones had 109 yards on six receptions , including the two most important ones of the game . Lacy had his first 100 yard game of the season . And the Packers defense recorded six sacks .
