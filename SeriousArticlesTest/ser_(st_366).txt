The truth is that killing innocent people is always wrong ? and no argument or excuse , no matter how deeply believed , can ever make it right . No religion on earth condones the killing of innocent people , no faith tradition tolerates the random killing of our brothers and sisters on this earth . . . . Islamic law is clearly against terrorism , against any kind of deliberate killing of civilians or similar collateral damage .
