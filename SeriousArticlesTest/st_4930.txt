This problem is not unique to Flint . It s occurring all over the USA to poor families who live in cheap housing . I ve learned that many laws are misapplied . And mostly poor and disenfranchised individuals are hurt . ( Nearly 42 of Flint s population falls under the poverty line . ) When it s convenient , laws don t seem to apply to those in powerful positions or those with friends in high places . In America , justice isn t blind it s for sale !
