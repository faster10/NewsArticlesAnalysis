MF : That s a great question . For those who are paying very close attention , Sophie , in 30 seconds , just describe the incredible complexity of this environment that we are in . What we have to do is to step back ! We re going to have to step back from this thing , instead of diving in with tactical capabilities and trying to think that we re going to solve this by killing more people . Sadly , for all the people that want peace peace is not the normal state , if you look at world history , and that doesn ' t mean I believe in warfare , I just know that in order to you know , the best defence to have is a function of being able to demonstrate that , and I think that we re going to have to demonstrate more of our military capabilities for a period , but what we really have to do is to step back and say , Okay , how do we want this region to be ? because it s not just two countries , it s not just Syria and Iraq . It s not just Lebanon and Jordan and the Saudis it s much greater than that . It stretches all the way over to West Africa , it stretches over . we know the IS now exists , they have a component in India , they have a component in Burma , they have a component in Afghanistan , and we have already seen ? threats inside of the Russian Federation , we have seen direct and very active threats inside of Europe and we just had one in the U . S . So , it s an idea that came from afar , this ideology came from afar , but know it is actually being home grown . So , we are going to have to step back .
