Tonight , the Democratic candidates for president gather to debate for the last time before the Iowa caucuses . Compared to their GOP counterparts , Hillary Clinton , Bernie Sanders , and Martin O ' Malley have been making their way through a rather drama free primary . But tonight , despite the soul sucking timing ? a Sunday night of a holiday weekend ? there might actually be some friction . The race between Clinton and Sanders is tight in Iowa and New Hampshire , and the two have finally started going after each other . Does that mean the debate ? the fourth of the primary ? will be full of biting attack lines , keen insights , and hilarious jokes ? Who knows . But we ' ll be here all night to record the best of the best , and also the stuff Martin O Malley says .
