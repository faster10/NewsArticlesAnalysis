Wilson and Newton have taken turns bouncing each other out of the playoffs in each of the past two postseasons , with Wilson currently holding a 4 2 lead in head to head matchups . Both are still young ( Wilson is 27 , Newton just 26 ) , both have great support around them and both seem just as keen on embracing the archetypal public personas being thrust upon them during their fledgling rivalry as Manning and Brady were in theirs . No , they don t play in the same division and aren t guaranteed to play each other every year , but neither were the Patriots and Colts Broncos . But that s the great part about the money first NFL : If there s another Brady Manning matchup waiting in the wings , the league will have no problem wringing every viewer and dollar it can out of it .
