" I appreciate more than you will ever know that you are honoring me , but the thing that thrills me the most is that you are honoring classical music , " Cliburn said . " Because I ' m only one of many . I ' m only a witness and a messenger . Because I believe so much in the beauty , the construction , the architecture invisible , the importance for all generations , for young people to come that it will help their minds , develop their attitudes and give them values . That is why I ' m so grateful that you have honored me in that spirit . "
