Mets : They ' re young , they throw hard and they have imposing nicknames . But there ' s so much more to all those live arms the Mets rebuilt around . New York ' s fearsome foursome of Matt Harvey ( The Dark Knight ) , Jacob deGrom ( the deGrominator ) , Syndergaard ( Thor ) and Steven Matz is polished beyond their years . The steady poise and nasty stuff they ' ve shown in the postseason has been something special . Harvey will start Game 1 in Kansas City , all that uproar about his innings limit a thing of the past . He went 13 8 with a 2 . 71 ERA in his first season back from Tommy John surgery . The star right hander is a drama magnet , but he loves a big stage . He shut down the Cubs in the NLCS opener and won both his playoff starts . Last season ' s NL Rookie of the Year , deGrom gets Game 2 . He was 14 8 with a 2 . 54 ERA before going 3 0 with a 1 . 80 ERA in three postseason outings . Syndergaard ( 9 7 , 3 . 24 ) hits 100 mph with his fastball and even made his first career relief appearance in Game 5 of the Division Series against the Dodgers . Fellow rookie Matz , the Long Island lefty who grew up a Mets fan about 50 miles from Citi Field , hasn ' t been asked to go very deep in his two postseason assignments . But the team thinks so highly of him , it pegged him for the October rotation after only six major league starts ( 4 0 , 2 . 27 ) . The group has combined for 147 career regular season starts , by far the fewest for a World Series foursome , according to STATS . New York threw 5 , 752 pitches clocked at 95 mph or faster this season , STATS said . Kansas City ranked second with 4 , 315 .
