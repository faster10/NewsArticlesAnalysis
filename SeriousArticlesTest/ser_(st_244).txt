The flip side of the decision is even more interesting , in a way : The Cardinals baited Dalton into checking out of the run play and going for it all , knowing that they were going to be huge underdogs if Dalton hit Green for a touchdown . It speaks to the faith that Bruce Arians and rookie defensive coordinator James Bettcher have in their players that they were willing to leave their backup cornerback on an island against one of the best wideouts in football with the game on the line . That was no accident . They dared Dalton to win the game for his team .
