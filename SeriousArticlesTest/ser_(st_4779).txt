Dubin : I won ' t lie . I did have to double check you on the red zone efficiency thing . Turns out , you ' re right . Carolina is sixth in red zone touchdown percentage ( that ' s exactly what it sounds like the percentage of red zone trips that end with a touchdown ) this season at 63 . 41 percent . That ' s up significantly from last year ' s 48 . 15 percent mark , which was 26th in the NFL . That ' ll go a long way toward explaining their increase in scoring .
