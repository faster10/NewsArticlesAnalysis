When asked why I would jump in into a primary ? kind of stirring it up a little bit , maybe ? and choose one over some friends who are running and I ve endorsed a couple others in their races before they decided to run for President , I was told , you know warned left and right , you are going to get so clobbered in the press . You are just going to get beat up , and chewed up , and spit out . You know , I m thinking , and ? You know , like you guys haven t tried to do that every day since that night in 2008 , when I was on stage nominated for VP Vice President , and I got to say , yeah , I ll go , send me , you betcha . I ll serve . And , like you all , I m still standing . So those of us who ve kind of gone through the ringer as Mr Trump has , it makes me respect you even more . That you re here , and you re putting your efforts and you re putting reputations , you are putting relationships on the line to do the right thing for this country . Because you are ready to make America great again !
