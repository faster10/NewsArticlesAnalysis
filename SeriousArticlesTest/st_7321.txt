Room is of course inspired by two cases from Austria : Natascha Kampusch , who was abducted and imprisoned in 1998 at the age of 10 , and the even more horrendous case of Elizabeth Fritzl , who in 2008 was revealed to have been kept captive and abused for 24 years in a basement of her father Josef s house . It s not a new subject in the cinema . Michael ( 2011 ) by the Austrian director Markus Schleinzer , showed some months in the life of a paedophile who keeps a child locked up in a dungeon . That s a film which is more pitiless , more shocking and more despairing than Room , perhaps because it focuses more directly on the abuser .
