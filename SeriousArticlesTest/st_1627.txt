Manuel Villacorta , a Bay Area based registered dietitian and specialist in sports nutrition , says , " We used to have to run for our lives , literally , but we ' re not doing that anymore . Now most of us are sitting for our lives and livelihoods . People think all that sugar they eat is going to their cells and some of it does . But the extra sugar floating around is going straight to the fat cells . It usually builds up in your waistline . And that ' s how stress is related to gaining weight . "
