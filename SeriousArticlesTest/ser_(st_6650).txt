Coaching : Head coach Todd Bowles kept his team together during a 1 4 midseason slide , and kept it together again Sunday , even when the Jets trailed late . Offensive coordinator Chan Gailey had a nice play call on the 25 yard screen pass touchdown to running back Bilal Powell in the second quarter . Gailey smartly kept things simple on the Jets ' final drive of regulation , which ended with a 9 yard jump ball touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick to Marshall , who used his size to go up and get it . That ' s exactly the sort of thing Gailey should be calling in the red zone . ?
