I don t think that is really the case . Immediately after 26 11 , the Pakistan army started crying wolf that India is about to attack , though we had not done anything . It was clear that they wanted you to ( attack ) . It was a time when three or four things had happened : Lashkar itself had split with Ilyas Kashmiri there were parts of the Lashkar which were saying that why are we sparing the Pakistani government . Pakistan army s stock was very low . It served both their interests to actually get you to react . So , why give them the authenticity ?
