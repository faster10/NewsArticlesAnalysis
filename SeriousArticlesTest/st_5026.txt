Iowa has a trio of capable running backs headed by Jordan Canzeri and his 12 touchdowns . The Hawkeyes and their always powerful offensive line grind teams down before breaking off big runs ( They ve had five that went for at least 50 yards this season ) . Michigan State s defense has fared well against teams that try to run them over this season . A defensive line that mixes experienced players such as Shilique Calhoun and young talent such as Malik McDowell does a good job of clearing the way for the fastest group of Spartans linebackers in recent memory .
