That ' s an easy one : the governor and his administration ' s total lack of urgency when it comes to the poisonous water in my community . Even today , they still seem to be missing the boat on the crisis in my community , the credibly that a number of individuals and departments have . This is not a political issue , this is a public health ? basically an emergency disaster ? issue , and that ' s how it should be treated . I think if everybody treated it that way , we ' d have a lot more work and cooperation , we ' d have a lot more action that would be moving in the right direction a lot quicker , and unfortunately that ' s not be the tact that they ' ve taken .
