Sanders stands out for his earthy language . His speeches are salted with the casual ? ? ? bulls ? ? ? s , ? ? ? damn ? ? ? s , and ? ? ? crap ? ? ? s that you ? ? ? d expect from a cranky old liberal .

His favorite tactic with a hostile audience is to declare that they won ? ? ? t agree on some crucial issue such as abortion or gay rights but can come together on a far more important problem : The rich are screwing us .
