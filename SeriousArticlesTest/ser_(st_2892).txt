A guy who could get some run there is Rich Rodriguez of Arizona , who has the Wildcats bowl eligible in all four of his seasons in Tucson . Rodriguez has a track record of knocking off high level competition : at Arizona alone , he has victories over opponents that were ranked No . 2 , No . 5 , No . 10 ( twice ) , No . 13 , No . 18 and No . 20 . There may be others in front of him on South Carolina s highly fluid list , but he d be worth a look .
