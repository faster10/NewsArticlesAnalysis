Massing bemoans that Gates and Zuckerberg aren t interested in radical change or wealth redistribution , and it s true billionaires tend not to be big advocates for these things . But it s absurd to expect them to be . Rather , it s here that they become scapegoats for our own failings . While Zuckerberg and Gates have a great deal of influence owing to their money , that power is magnified by the sheer lack of public will for governments to fix our most pressing problems . Given the amount of effort it took to make an incremental fix to our health insurance system in the form of Obamacare , the next drastic steps in health care reform may very well come not from government but from the private sector doing an end run around the big insurers . There is a massive investment void in America , and with our political system s inability to utilize it , it is inevitable that private parties will start to fill it . Their judgments may be reasonably good ( I ll give this one to Gates ) , or they may be bad ( hello , Koch Brothers ! ) , but they definitely will be autocratic . But that s not on them . It s on us .
