The cars are electric , and work much like a gigantic version of the slot cars kids play with . This is the same technology that powers Test Track , an Epcot ride . After boarding the six person car , you take a leisurely , scenic tour of Ornament Valley . Soon you enter a nighttime section , where you ' ll find old friends from Radiator Springs and have adventures including tractor tipping with Mater . Next , after an upgrade of tires or paint , and a quick visit to Doc Hudson , your crew chief , the ride turns into a thrilling race for Piston Cup glory .
