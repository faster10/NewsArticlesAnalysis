A . Preparedness is the key to this . People need to be prepared all year round , especially for the loss of power . Have a NOAA radio with batteries that are fresh . A survey has shown very low percentage of people get information from weather radios . I have tried to remind viewers that it is available . You need to be educated on whether you are at risk , if today is going to be a tornado day . Where is my safe place ? It is the lowest level of your home , away from windows . Cover yourself up . If you are outdoors , you need to know if there is a risk of storms . Know where there is a sturdy building with a bathroom . Where am I going to evacuate ? You need to take that responsibility .
