" My New Year ' s resolution is to get out of the cab and back into a 9 to 5 . It ' s just a matter of closing a deal . . . . I also want to write a book . I could call it ' From Street to Street ' from Wall Street to having to work the street , so to speak . I think it would be a story of survival understanding that you can have everything at times and sometimes when things get tough , you ' re forced to take other routes . But there is light at the end of the tunnel . And if you stay focused you can get through anything . "
