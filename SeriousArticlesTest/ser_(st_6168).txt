While these public prayers have been called proclamations of thanksgiving , they have expressed much more than gratitude over the years . As all prayers , they have been used to petition God for assistance , to thank him for his mercy and abundance , to atone for our personal and national sins , and to praise him as the Lord and Ruler of Nations . These declarations are an overt recognition that while America has a government that neither promotes a given religion nor prohibits the free exercise thereof , belief in God is an integral part of the nation s history , culture and society .
