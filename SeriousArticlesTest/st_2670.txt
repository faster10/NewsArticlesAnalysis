Prime Minister David Cameron said on Thursday it was time to join air strikes against Islamic State in Syria because Britain cannot " subcontract its security to other countries " . Many Britons are wary of entering into another war in the Middle East after Western intervention in Iraq , Afghanistan and Libya failed to bring stability to the region and some believe led to the rise of militants groups such as Islamic State . But after Islamic State claimed responsibility for killing 130 people in Paris , some members of parliament who were reluctant to launch further military action in the Middle East now feel it is needed to protect Britain from such attacks .
