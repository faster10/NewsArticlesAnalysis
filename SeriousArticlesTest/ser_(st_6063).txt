I m not sure saying he had a loving relationship with Donald Trump was such a hot idea , even in jest . It s just weird . But that s Jeb ! He also droned on about his proven record over and over again and tried to sound as hawkish as the rest of the bloodthirsty crowd with a startling comment : Get the lawyers off the damn backs of the military once and for all , which can only be interpreted to mean that as president he would authorize war crimes . He s a real Bush , after all .
