NOTED : CLINTON S PITCH IN THE GRANITE STATE . Clinton ' s campaign appears to be pulling out all the stops in New Hampshire , despite repeatedly acknowledging that the chances of a win are little to none . At a campaign event in Derry yesterday , the Democratic presidential candidate charged against critics who questioned why she is spending time in the state , ABC s LIZ KREUTZ reports . I come here well aware of the fact that a lot of political pundits have been opining , as political pundits do , that I should have just skipped coming to New Hampshire , Clinton told the crowd inside here at a Boys Girls club . I have to tell you , I could not ever skip New Hampshire , she added , So I m gonna be out here , making my case . http : abcn . ws 1X4aV8e
