A supernova ' s spectrum ( how light is distributed across the blue green yellow red optical spectrum ) reveals the speed with which it is receding from us due to the expansion of the universe . You ' ve probably noticed how the tone of a siren changes as it moves toward or away from you , and that the change is larger the faster the vehicle moves . Light emitted from supernovae shows the same kind of frequency shift , so its speed can be measured very accurately .
