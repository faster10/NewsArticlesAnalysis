I would sit in church and think , in God s eyes , how does he see me ? Am I doing okay with this life ? And after talking to my pastor and telling him my whole story , I kind of had a revelation that maybe , at this point in my life , this is why God put me on this earth . Maybe it is time to speak on this issue . I was getting destroyed in the rags , every week walking through the grocery lines there s some BS story . Never talked to them once . But maybe , maybe out of all the things I ve done in my life , this could be by far the biggest thing I ve ever done , to be able to live my authentic self and make a difference in the world , you know ? And I thought , what an honor . What a life , to be able to reinvent yourself like that . And I am not a spokesperson for the trans community , I am not . The media kind of projects me as being the spokesperson , but from my standpoint , I am not . I am a spokesperson for my story and that s all I can tell . And hopefully by telling my story , I can make people think .
