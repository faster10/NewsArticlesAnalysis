The last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was " Twilight , " which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller . Directed by Karyn Kusama , who made " Girlfight " and " Aeon Flux , " " Jennifer ' s Body " isn ' t anything like that . It ' s a much edgier , snappier , bloodier film , aimed primarily at young hipsters and horror fans plus anyone else curious to see Megan Fox get nasty . ( That ' s got to include a sizable chunk of the audience , surely ? )
