The Europol chief said national police forces needed to have better access to a database compiled by its international counterpart , Interpol , of stolen and fake documents . " There are many criminal actors that have become more active , more sophisticated and also the quality of the faked documents they are providing ( has improved ) , and they responded to the opportunities that the migration crisis in 2015 gave us , " he said . " So we need to make sure that our border guard officials are alive to that threat , that they are better trained , of course , and to make sure that there is access to the right databases , including the dedicated database that Interpol has on lost and stolen documents .
