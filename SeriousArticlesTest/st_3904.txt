About the Cardinals : The biggest reason they are in the conference championship game is they ' ve kept quarterback Carson Palmer healthy . Palmer ' s only dud of the season came in Week 17 when the entire Cardinals team failed to show up in a 36 6 loss to Seattle . Palmer is among the MVP candidates , but Carolina counterpart Cam Newton is the consensus favorite . . . Wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald has 53 receptions for 912 yards and 10 touchdowns in eight postseason games . Simply double those numbers to put it in perspective of a 16 game season : 106 catches , 1 , 824 yards and 20 TDs . Wow . . . Remember when David Johnson torched the Eagles for 187 rushing yards in Week 15 ? He has 99 yards total in the three games since . Coach Bruce Arians says his o line is getting manhandled . " It ' s not anything David is doing , " Arians said . " There ' s just not a lot of holes there , and we have to do a better job . " . . . Arians was not interviewed for the Eagles ' head coaching position in 2013 , so he took the Arizona job .
