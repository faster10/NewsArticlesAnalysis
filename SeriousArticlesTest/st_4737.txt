In addition to some American boots on the ground , the U . S . should aim to enlist those who are now most directly affected by the ISIS monstrosity Syria ' s neighbors and Western Europe to carry the larger part of the ground combat burden . Perhaps Paris and Washington can spearhead a NATO response to a wanton attack on a member state . Perhaps a coalition of the willing can be assembled . Competent ground forces supported by American led air power can make reasonably short work of a rabble , even though operations in built up areas will be difficult . The alternative is to wait for indigenous forces to attain critical combat mass . It would likely be a long wait , leaving ISIS free to sink roots inside Syria and commission atrocities abroad .
