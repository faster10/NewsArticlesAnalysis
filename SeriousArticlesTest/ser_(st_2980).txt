While some of the anti military plots were serious , in particular the deadly assault on Fort Hood , others were more aspirational than operational . Rezwan Ferdaus , for instance , is charged with hatching a harebrained plan to attack the Pentagon and U . S . Capitol earlier this year using remote controlled model aircraft loaded with explosives . Ferdaus was snared by government informants who supplied him with the cash to take his " scouting trips " to scope out the targets , and even to buy the model planes that were to be used in the plot . He has pleaded not guilty .
