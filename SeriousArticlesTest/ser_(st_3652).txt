Well , consider the fact that Lincoln garnered an 85 , 846 average upon its debut in 11 theaters last weekend . When the film went wide this weekend , that number dropped all the way to 11 , 831 still a strong result , but a substantial dilution that naturally occurs upon expansion . Silver Linings Playbook and Anna Karenina can ' t afford to let their per theater averages drop by a similar ratio , and both will need to expand much more slowly and rely on terrific word of mouth to carry them to profitability .
