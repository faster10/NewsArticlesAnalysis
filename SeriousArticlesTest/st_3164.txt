That s the big one . You have to completely face guard Klay Thompson . You have to take a defender out of the play , and that opens the floor for Draymond Green , Andrew Bogut and Andre Iguodala , explained Scal . It s the shooting overall , and especially the shooting off of transition . That is the biggest thing . If you can eliminate the transition buckets , you have a chance can beat these guys . I m not just trying to gas the Celtics , but if Klay Thompson isn t 100 percent I think the Celtics will win this game .
