The boycott was very effective . Most black residents stayed off the buses . Within days , the boycott leaders formed a new group , the Montgomery Improvement Association ( MIA ) . At Nixon ' s urging , they elected a hesitant King as president , in large part because he was new in town and not embroiled in the competition for congregants and visibility among black ministers . He was also well educated and already a brilliant orator , and thus would be a good public face for the protest movement . The ministers differed over whether to call off the boycott after one day but agreed to put the question up to a vote at a mass meeting .
