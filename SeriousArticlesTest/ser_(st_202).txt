I was able to help people in a terribly vulnerable time in their lives . I successfully created families through adoption . I would shepherd them to help that child who was severely malnourished , depressed , delayed , and emotionally deprived become a really solid , juicy little butterball , happy it was really like being the stork . In the best of both worlds , it was the stork , not just the delivery of a baby in a hospital room , it was really the delivery of a baby by a collaboration , a team effort , by adoption service professionals , myself , the families . We were helping a little tiny child who had no potential become a person . I ' m very proud of that work . I ' m just so proud of that work .
