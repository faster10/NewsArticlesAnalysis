But having said that , there are things that are just like now , and I ' ve got to tell you that " Mission to Paris " has an awful lot of just like now . The kind of political warfare they had then is a lot like the kind of political warfare going on now . There ' s a lot of propaganda , a lot of manipulation , a lot of trying to destroy people ' s reputations , a lot of lowdown tough stuff . I think most Americans don ' t like it , but it ' s the way the game is played , and it hasn ' t changed . That ' s the way the game was played in the 1930s . I haven ' t changed anything , not one thing to make it sound more like what goes on today . I was amazed when I discovered what was going on back then . I didn ' t know that it went on to that level of sophistication .
