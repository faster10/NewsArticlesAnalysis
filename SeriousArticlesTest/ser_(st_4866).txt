These sorts of questions are not going to be decided in three pages , not even if you set the font to two points and give a government subsidized magnifying glass to every taxpaying individual and business owner . Nor will shrinking the tax return to a postcard allow us to get rid of the IRS , as Ted Cruz bizarrely claimed . ( Where do we mail the postcards ? Publishers Clearing House ? ) Fiorina , having run a business , and Cruz , having spent a little time in Washington , presumably understand that what they ' re saying makes no sense .
