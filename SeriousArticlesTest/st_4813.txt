If Miss Golden Globe looks familiar , it s because she owes 50 percent of her DNA to Jamie Foxx . This year s Miss Golden Globe ? the poised young lady ( or , on rare occasion , young man ) who makes sure winners don t walk in circles on their way off the stage ? is Corinne Foxx , daughter of presenter and 2005 Globe winner Jamie Foxx . The honor is typically bestowed upon Hollywood progeny , and has included heirs to Hollywood royalty like Melanie Griffith ( 1975 ) , Laura Dern ( 1982 ) and Freddie Prinze , Jr . ( 1996 ) . The younger Foxx is an aspiring model actress and a student at the University of Southern California .
