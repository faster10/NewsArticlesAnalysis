Conservatives like to say that women are the " victims of abortion " and that laws such as the Indiana " feticide " measure are intended to " protect " them . Years ago , the president of the anti choice Susan B . Anthony List made assurances that the specter of women being prosecuted and jailed under anti choice laws was nothing more than fearmongering by pro choice activists . The website of the Ohio Right to Life association similarly argues that " no one is interested in sending women to jail . "
