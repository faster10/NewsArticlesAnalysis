One of the best shows in New York I had was the week after 9 11 . I was surprised this comedy club was even going to have a show . They said people were looking for a diversion . I went up and said I ' m not trying to make light of what happened , I ' m just trying to forget about it for an hour . I find it ' s similar to what is happening with the economy . Obviously , it ' s not as serious as 9 11 , but people are looking for an escape . I think people want to laugh .
