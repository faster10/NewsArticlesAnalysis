Mass audiences finally caught up with Bowie at the dawn on the MTV era . He had been crafting music videos long before there was a proper outlet for them , but the cable channel gave him a platform for clips like 1983 s China Girl , which helped turn him into an international pop sensation . Even as MTV boosted him , though , he was never afraid to bite the hand that fed him . It occurred to me , having watched MTV over the last few months , that s it s a solid enterprise , really . It s got a lot going for it . I m just floored by the fact that there are so few black artists featured on it , he told VJ Mark Goodman during an on air interview in 1983 . Why is that ?
