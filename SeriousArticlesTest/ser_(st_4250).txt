Boundless fantasy optimism is Snoopy ' s domain , after all , and maybe it ' s no surprise that the beagle ' s moments in The Peanuts Movie are the most charming . It ' s giddy watching Snoopy conjure his Red Baron battles in widescreen , piloting his doghouse through a European countryside like something out of a Howard Hughes film , backed by an all Woodstock pit crew , a rousing orchestral score , and those Melendez cackles . This peculiar sense of childlike ( or doglike ) playfulness has been slumbering for decades inside that red doghouse ? and for whatever doesn ' t work in this new incarnation , abandoning Snoopy in the purgatory of MetLife commercials would have been a far greater crime . The Flying Ace flies on , and all ' s right with the world .
