Watt first missed a practice with the injury on Dec . 2 but hasn ' t missed a game with it . A week later , on Dec . 9 , Watt broke his hand during practice . He played with a club shaped cast that constricted his fingers against the Patriots , Colts and Titans , and notched one sack during that stretch . Watt was able to play without a cast in the Texans ' regular season finale against the Jaguars and had three sacks and two passes defensed . The hand injury will not need any surgical repair .
