" We ' ve seen the power of having young adults serve in our school through AmeriCorps , " said Los Angeles Superintendent of Schools John Deasy . " When a student doesn ' t show up to school , they get them back in . When they ' re behind academically , they help catch them up . These young people bring an infectious energy and idealism that makes a huge difference . The only problem is that we don ' t have enough of them we need to scale up national service and tap more young people to give a year of service . It ' s a resource you can ' t put a price tag on .
