The president ' s linkage of climate change and terrorism makes sense . Americans view groups like ISIS as a much bigger threat than climate change , despite the fact that climate change already affects many more people around the world in far more countries . It s unfortunate the problem isn t considered worthy of action on its own , and I m not sure the language of military threats is the best one to apply to every major challenge the country faces , but it s hard to beat the threat of terrorism when you re trying to motivate Americans to act .
