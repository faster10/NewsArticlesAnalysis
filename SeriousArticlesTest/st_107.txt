The 5 to 10 percent tax on admissions for events of more than 2 , 500 people was initially proposed by City Councilman Sam Torres , who believes that the cost would add an average of 18 to each ticket . Torres belives this would generate 4 million for Indio , which recently had to cut almost 4 million from its budget through layoffs and leaves of absence . Tollett , however , estimated that the tax would make tickets approximately 36 more expensive , a cost he did not want to make festivalgoers pay the tax , then , would cost Goldenvoice an extra 4 to 6 million .
