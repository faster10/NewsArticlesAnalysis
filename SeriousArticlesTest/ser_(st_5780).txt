Ruah : I think when it comes to buzz , and I ' m just saying this on a very general note and from what I see , it could be completely wrong , but from what I see , buzz tends to come from younger generations , people who buy the products , people who go on the Internet , people who go on blogs . The generation that watches our show seems to be a little bit of an older one and I think that might be the reason . I know a lot of procedurals have huge viewership yet they ' re never nominated for awards . You never really see , as you say , a lot of buzz around them .
