Trumbull : High frame rates do make what you want fantastical to look raw and video like . I agree that that ' s a quality " The Hobbit " started to assume and a lot of people felt really uncomfortable with that . ( But ) I ' ve seen the movie all ways I ' ve seen it in 2D at 24 frames , I ' ve seen it in 3D at 24 frames , and I ' ve seen it in 3D at 48 frames . And because I ' m so adapted to it , I really like the 48 frames .
