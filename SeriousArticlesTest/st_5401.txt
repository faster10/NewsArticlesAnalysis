Russian President Vladimir Putin has his own plan for Syria . Sergey Lavrov , his top diplomat , has made a point of stressing the point that without the Syrian regime on board , any attempt to defeat ISIS won ' t work . A similar scenario to the one that had been used to prevent the U . S . bombing Syria last year is shaping up nicely in Moscow . Russia will ask the U . S . to cooperate with Assad in the battle against ISIS , without the Syrian President having to fear that he might be bumped off along the way . The hawks in Washington might not like this script , but hey , stranger things have happened in power politics in the past .
