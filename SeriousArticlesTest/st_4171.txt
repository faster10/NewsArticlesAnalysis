Despite all he played through , Watt finished the regular season with 17 . 5 sacks ( the most in the NFL ) , 76 tackles ( 57 of them solo ) , eight passes defensed and three forced fumbles . He also had 50 quarterback hits this season and 29 tackles for loss . It ' s crazy to think that Watt ' s stats could have been even better had he not been forced to play with one hand wrapped up in a club cast for three games .
