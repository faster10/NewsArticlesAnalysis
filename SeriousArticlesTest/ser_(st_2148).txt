The Mets swept the Cubs thanks in large part to Daniel Murphy , who had to be one of the more obvious choices in NLCS MVP voting history . In Wednesday s clincher , he set a playoff record by homering in a sixth straight game . He has seven overall for the series and his victims include Clayton Kershaw , Zack Greinke , Jon Lester , and Jake Arrieta . Murphy has been a good hitter since he debuted in 2008 , but he s never been a major power threat . He had just 14 homers this season , a career high . Perhaps the stat that best illustrates how locked in he is at the moment is that he s had more hits in the playoffs ( 16 ) than swings and misses ( 12 ) . Murphy has also been an asset at second base and on the bases , where he s often had lapses in his career . In other words , the Mets are getting the good Murph ( a really , really good Murph ) without any of the bad Murph .
