Dmitri Kovtun had called a friend known only as D3 out of the blue to suggest they meet up so that he could ask for a favour . As they left the upmarket Tarantella restaurant and strolled together to a casino , Kovtun told his friend that he wanted to track down a mutual acquaintance , an Albanian chef , to ask him to put some " very expensive " poison into Litvinenko ' s food or drink , according to D3 ' s later account to police . " Litvinenko was a traitor , there is blood on his hands , " Kovtun allegedly told him .
