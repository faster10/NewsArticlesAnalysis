One more time , Peyton Manning tries to win the second Super Bowl we thought he might be about to win until Tracy Porter made an interception for the Saints in Super Bowl 44 that was the equivalent of a walk off home run . He gets one more Sunday like this , what might be his last . He can walk away at the top of his sport , even if he doesn t do it at the top of the game . Hardly anybody ever does . Michael Jordan averaged 20 a game at the age of 40 for a mediocre Wizards team . You saw what Derek Jeter was like in his last years with the Yankees , as much as we celebrated the bleeder that got him one more walk off RBI at Yankee Stadium .
