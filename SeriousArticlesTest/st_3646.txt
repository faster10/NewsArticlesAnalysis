Fortunately for Summit ( a Lionsgate company following their acquisition earlier this year ) , who spent about 120 million to produce Breaking Dawn Part 2 , that cult of loyal fans is still gigantic . The film scored a blazing 34 , 717 per theater average from its 4 , 070 theaters the best average at the entire box office . Twihards are known for rushing to the theater at the first possible moment , so Breaking Dawn Part 2 is expected to fall quickly from here , but with the lucrative Thanksgiving frame coming up , it should enjoy at least one more massive weekend and climb to about 300 million total .
