noise isn t really a problem at Levi s stadium . Part of that is because of the mild 49er fan base ( which includes many corporate types in the stands ) . But the other reason is because of the open area design of the stadium . It was supposed to emphasize the nice Northern California sunny weather . But the result is a stadium that doesn t hold in sound ( which doesn t allow the crowd to effect the opposing team which gives the Niners little homefield advantage ) .
