Some caveats : House leadership is not going to pass immigration reform over the heads of conservative Republicans . It will pass it only with them with their support . The House is not going to take up the Senate immigration bill . Any movement in the House will be piecemeal , smaller measure by smaller measure , each addressing a different aspect of what ' s wrong with the immigration system . Leadership is not going to waive what ' s known as the Hastert rule , under which every bill that passes must command a majority of the majority at least 118 Republican votes . And there will be no path to citizenship for most unauthorized immigrant adults it ' s going to be enough of a stretch for the House to deliver a path to legal status that stops short of citizenship .
