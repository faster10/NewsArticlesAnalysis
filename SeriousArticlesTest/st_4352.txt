On Dec . 9 , 2014 , Newton got into a car accident that left him with two traverse fractures in his lower back . He missed one game , but since then he ' s been a beast for the Panthers and Fantasy owners mostly without a true No . 1 receiver . Sure , Greg Olsen is a stud tight end , but can you imagine how good Newton will be once Kelvin Benjamin ( torn ACL ) is back after missing all of 2015 ? Newton has played 22 games since the car accident , including the playoffs , and he ' s averaging 26 . 3 Fantasy points over that span . To put that in perspective , Andrew Luck was the No . 1 quarterback in 2014 and averaged 24 Fantasy points over 19 games , including the playoffs . Newton , barring an injury in the Super Bowl , enters 2016 as the clear cut No . 1 Fantasy quarterback , and he ' s worth drafting in Round 2 in all leagues . But here ' s what Newton is facing . The last time a quarterback finished first in Fantasy points in consecutive seasons was Manning in 2003 04 . And the last time the first quarterback drafted in most leagues finished No . 1 at the position was Aaron Rodgers in 2011 . Still , we expect Newton to be exceptional again , especially with Benjamin back , and he ' s worth drafting with an early round selection .
