I found myself in Maison Premiere , a new bar made to look old . Dim lights , bourgie cocktails , mounds of oysters , and within minutes I was behind a drink and slurping the briny insides of cold shells . Looking around the horseshoe bar , I noticed that everyone else seemed to be taking this well appointed , affordable bar in stride . I , on the other hand , was delighted with myself for stumbling across it . ( I shouldn ' t have been Brooklyn has a disproportionate amount of handsome drinking establishments : Hotel Delmano and Night of Joy , for two . )
