True , he earned his astronomic salary playing a game ? a fun , popular game . No one mistakes pro basketball for ditch digging . It ' s not an entirely cushy gig , though . Kobe fractured one knee and had surgery on the other , tore an Achilles tendon , sprained a shoulder , strained a hip flexor and tweaked too many ankles to count . He ' ll feel pain most days for the rest of his life . In the end he ' ll hobble . Even in retirement , I ' ll bet he ' d pay 100 million for a body wiped clean of bygone injuries ? a sum he earned over his last four seasons , proving once and for all that he was wise not to waste his first four in college .
