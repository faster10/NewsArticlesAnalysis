The citizens of this country are rejecting the career politicians . They do not like the direction the country is being pushed by the politicians in Washington . The politicians create problems and then cannot agree on a resolution to fix anything they only want to blame each other for the problem . There could be a lengthy debate over which is the worst accomplishment by the people we hired . It could be the monumental debt , or the inability to secure the borders , or illegal immigration , or rampant crime and drug trafficking , a stagnant economy , or a record number of people receiving food stamps .
