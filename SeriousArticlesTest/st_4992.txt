" Words can ' t describe how I feel for Hogan , " said Lloyd , who arrived at Stanford as a quarterback . " Spending my first two years in the quarterback room with him , being able to follow in his footsteps and seeing how he approaches the game with his calm demeanor . He ' s a stud with his smooth confidence . If he ' s hurt , he ' s going to play through it for the team . It ' s not about himself . He ' s always been a person for the greater good . We love him . He ' s the best leader I ' ve been around . "
