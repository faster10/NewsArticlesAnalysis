Flint went off Detroit water and started drawing and treating water from the Flint River in 2014 . Residents immediately complained about the water ' s smell and hardness , though it wasn ' t until later that the water was determined to be corrosive and leaching lead off the pipes . The testing that ultimately resulted in the issue being exposed was conducted by Marc Edwards , a professor at Virginia Tech . Then Hurley Medical Center Dr Mona Hanna Attisha tested children in the area and determined that they had higher levels of lead in their blood , too . Flint has since been declared to be in a state of emergency by state and federal authorities .
