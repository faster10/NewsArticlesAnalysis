For Guetta , both continents played a role , " this is what happened . . . it was born in the U . S . , but the U . K . made it trendy . And it became a massive movement in Europe , but never in the U . S . , which is crazy " . He later adds , " I think America is always creating the new movement and then the U . K . has this genius of taking this concept and making it accessible to the masses . "
