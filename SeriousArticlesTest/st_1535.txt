Slot machine payouts vary state by state . Some states set a required minimum : 83 in Arkansas , for example . Others leave that decision up to the casino , as in Georgia and California . Some states require casinos to disclose their payouts . In others , that information is kept confidential . Based on what is published , however , it ' s a fair generalization that a player can expect to lose 10 to 15 of his or her stake at every session . The cheaper the game , the lower the payout : slots that charge 5 per round pay better than slots that charge a penny .
