Saletan previously wrote a piece denouncing Hillary Clinton for teasing Sanders over a moment in the Democratic debate when Sanders told her not to shout . The anger of that piece felt like an overreaction Hillary and her supporters delivered more of ? a mild nose tweaking than some outraged accusation of misogyny . Now Saletan s overreacting to an even more reasonable point ? ? though not a joke ? that Clinton is making about one of Sanders talking points justifying his lax voting record on gun control : That there are some ugly racial implications to it .
