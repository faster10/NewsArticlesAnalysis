The director of Star Wars : The Force Awakens , appearing at TCA Tuesday to promote his TV show Roadies , talked about the lineage of the film ' s mysterious heroine Rey ( Daisy Ridley ) . " I know quite a bit , " he teased . " Obviously it ' s not for me to talk about in this moment because this is Rian ' s story to continue now . The last thing I ' m going to do is reveal something that he would be upset about . I want to make sure that Rian gets the courtesy that he showed me . "
