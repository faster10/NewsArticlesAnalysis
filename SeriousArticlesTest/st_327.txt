Essentially all five defendants are accused of being part of a criminal conspiracy which involved them in illegally procuring and successively revealing information and documents concerning the fundamental interests of the Holy See . All five are charged under section IX of the Vatican s Crimes against the Security of the State , a law strengthened by the pope in the wake of the 2012 Vatileaks 1 case which saw Pope Benedict s butler , Paolo Gabriele , convicted and eventually pardoned for having stolen confidential documents from the papal apartment . If found guilty , the defendants could face an eight year prison sentence .
