When I first wrote about the series last month , based on watching just the first two episodes , I misunderstood the premise of the series Making a ? Murderer is about the particular fallibility of the courts system , not incarceration . Specifically , Steven Avery s life is dominated by three court cases ? two where he is the defendant and one where his nephew Brendan Dassey is the defendant ? and the docuseries spends several hours focusing on the arguments and processes of just one of those cases , the 2006 trial against Avery for the rape , mutilation and murder of photographer Teresa Halbach . Making a ? Murderer reveals the trial to be a breathtaking display of police and district attorney misconduct , as Manitowoc County law enforcement go well out of their way to pin Avery for the crime despite any and all evidence to the contrary . That includes planted evidence , tainted evidence , coerced confessions , memory manipulation and , when that fails , outright lying . Making a ? Murderer excels in uncovering the frustrating , warped details . The most riveting moments of the docuseries are in what should , by all rights , be nothing but dry courtroom back and forth Making a ? Murderer makes Avery s defense lawyers , Dean Strang and Jerry Buting , into careful , brilliant , avenging heroes as they steadily chip away at piece after piece of the prosecution s flimsy case .
