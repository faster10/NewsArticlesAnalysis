I don ' t really like Nirvana that much grins . Sorry , promotional people , Universal . I ' m more into Mercury Rev , Oasis , Brian Jonestown Massacre laughs . The grunge scene is not what I ' m interested in . But " Territorial Pissings " on Nevermind is a f great song . And " Dumb " on In Utero I cry every time I hear that song . It ' s a stripped down version of Kurt ' s perception of himself of himself on drugs , off drugs , feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation .
