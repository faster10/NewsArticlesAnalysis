Those small gradations allow the UK government more leeway in their response ( what they actually do , rather than the bluster of first reactions ) and they blur Putin s alleged involvement more than Kremlin may have feared , however indignant Russian spokespeople appeared to be yesterday . So bad are UK Russian relations overall and such is the UK interest in improving them , because of Russia s mediating role with Iran and Syria that I would hazard that there is a strong probability , to borrow Sir Robert s technique , that bilateral relations will not actually become much worse . ?
