There s another reason not to laugh . Which is that this brand of populism is not new : it has a l ong and ignoble history in US politics , and it s poisonous . It channels genuine , understandable rage and frustration ? at stagnant wages , say , or rising healthcare costs ? and directs it not at the real source of those problems but at much easier targets . Those always include the media or the Washington establishment , but it rarely ? ends there . Eventually it turns on ? an easily despised minority .
