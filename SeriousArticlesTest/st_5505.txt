As I ve said many times before , when you put everything in historical perspective , Yogi Berra had like four ballots . Joe DiMaggio had three ballots . And so myself being sort of a student of the history of the game , and having respect for the process , it was nail biting at times but I had a tremendous amount of support throughout my career from the writers and the fans . . . . I don t want to say it was difficult . All of the emotions came into it every year , but again , knowing the history of the game and how many great players throughout this game had to wait years , sometimes many years , it keeps it in perspective .
