? Trump s previous inclination to let the Russians lead the charge in Syria ignored the fact that Putin s forces are not in Syria to defeat Islamic State they are there to prop up Syrian President Bashar Assad . Until Assad goes , Turkey and Saudi Arabia will hold back from full engagement in fighting Islamic State because they are enemies of Assad . Most foreign policy and military experts agree that it would be far better to have Muslim troops taking on the terrorists than an army of Americans . That is why the Turks and Saudis need to be on board . That is also why Trump s new pledge to flatten Syria with American bombs is such a bad idea . The result would be thousands of civilian casualties . Rather than finishing off Islamic State , such an indiscriminate military assault would likely produce a new generation of terrorists .
