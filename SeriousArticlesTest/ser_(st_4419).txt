Head coach Andy Reid has a 5 0 career record against the Texans , including two victories since his 2013 arrival in Kansas City . This includes the Chiefs ' 27 20 win over Houston in the 2015 season opener that was more lopsided than the score appeared . Reid appears to have sound knowledge on how to stymie Houston although the Chiefs must do a better job blocking Texans defensive end J . J . Watt , who had nine tackles and two sacks in that Week One encounter .
