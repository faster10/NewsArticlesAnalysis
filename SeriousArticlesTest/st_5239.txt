England cricket outcast Kevin Pietersen has been tweeting more about golf than cricket , especially about playing at Wentworth . Certainly , KP would find becoming a member at European Tour headquarters Wentworth rather easier than at nearby Sunningdale , where arch foe Andrew Strauss plays his golf . However , Pietersen did tweet yesterday that Jaguar were ending their England cricket sponsorship as revealed last summer by Sports Agenda . But KP didn ' t say that one of the reasons why the endorsement ended was his refusal to drive a Jaguar when on international duty .
