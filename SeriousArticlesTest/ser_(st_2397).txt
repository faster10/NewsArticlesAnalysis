The Jets simply don ' t have the linebackers to compete in coverage against running backs over the middle and down the sideline . Outside linebacker Calvin Pace and inside linebacker David Harris look a step slower than we ' ve seen them in recent years , and they have both struggled when tasked with pass coverage . Inside linebacker Demario Davis has the speed , but lacks the awareness to be a successful coverage linebacker . The Giants need to exploit this weakness with a heavy dosage of Vereen and the hurry up offense . Vereen hasn ' t been a major part of the offense recently , as the Giants have shifted to a full blown four man committee at running back , but this is a game where the matchups dictate that he stays on the field .
