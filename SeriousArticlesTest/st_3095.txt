The drivers Jeff Gordon , Kevin Harvick , Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr . have displayed gentlemanly behavior all week . You could see the sometimes snarky and quick witted Harvick and Busch bite their tongues to the point where you wondered whether they would spit blood , but they ' ve all had plenty of experience in these situations . Thanks to the four round , elimination style format , they ' ve all been asked just how far they would go to get out of the first round . And then the second round . And then the third round . They ' ve also been asked about the role of teammates and of retaliation .
