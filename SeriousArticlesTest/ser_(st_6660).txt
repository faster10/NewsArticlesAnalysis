So it is pretty bad , and it ' s actually a real problem . I have to do certain things now . I have to sit in the front seat . Sometimes I ' ll ask the guys to let me drive . I ' ll drive even in New York , because I don ' t get sick when I drive . All your senses are firing on the same level when you ' re driving the car . I open the windows , even in the colder weather to get some fresh air . That seems to help . Sometimes I will eat something that ' s calming on my stomach beforehand so I at least don ' t get the nausea associated with it . It ' s very problematic for me . It ' s like a migraine . If I get there , if I allow myself to get to the point where I ' m motion sick , then I ' m pretty much toast . I ' m going to have a bad 45 minutes or so .
