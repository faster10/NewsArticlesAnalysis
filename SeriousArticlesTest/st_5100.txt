From his grandfather , former Boston Mayor John F . " Honey Fitz " Fitzgerald , young Ted heard of the great wave of Irish immigrants to America that included their family . And in the 1990s , the efforts of Ted and his sister , U . S . Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith , to bring peace to their ancestral homeland seemed to reflect their deeper sense of being Irish , of being Catholic and of being members of a family coming from an often oppressed immigrant minority . Ted went back to Ireland many times , including to the old Kennedy homestead in Dunganstown .
