Fans of Star Wars : The Force Awakens ? may complain that the serviceable but unremarkable reboot of the beloved franchise failed to make the best picture list . ( It did far better in such technical categories as visual effects and sound . ) But it bodes well for the industry in general that popcorn blockbusters such as Mad Max : Fury Road ? and The Martian ? were artful and sophisticated enough to merit Oscar recognition , just as it bodes well that such adult oriented dramas as Steven Spielberg ' s Bridge of Spies ? are still getting made and , more important , getting seen .
