ABOUT THE RAPTORS ( 12 8 ) : Toronto is just behind the Warriors in defensive field goal percentage ( 42 . 7 ) but is not nearly as efficient at the other end of the floor ( 43 . 6 ) . Toronto had to rally from 17 points down to earn a 96 86 win at Atlanta on Wednesday and did not have enough gas in the tank to overcome another large deficit on Thursday . Teams are coming out aggressive and we aren t matching their intensity , point guard Kyle Lowry told reporters . We have to figure out how to match other teams intensity or come out with more ourselves .
