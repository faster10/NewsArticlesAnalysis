ChristopherM " I am a soldier in the U . S . Army . I am a 20 year old combat veteran . I returned home this past summer and enrolled in college with hopes of going to law school . Unfortunately , with future deployments likely to postpone my schooling , I will be in college long past traditional college years . That is just a minor nuisance compared with the fact that relating to my family and friends is infinitely more difficult since I ' ve returned . I find myself zoning out and going back to the war during family functions and when I ' m out with my friends , I apparently talk in my sleep about the war and occasionally sleepwalk . "
