" The old man wanted help finding his kid , " the intelligence official said . " If he thought he was a bona fide terrorist , and he wanted him back , the embassy in Nigeria would have been the last place to go . The U . S . doesn ' t send terrorists home , no questions asked .

But it ' s the season for second guessing , so anything goes . "
