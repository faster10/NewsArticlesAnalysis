Al Assad turned out to be a false reformer . I remember a meeting I had with him in 2003 in Damascus , and I asked him why the reform movement seemed to be stalled in Syria . He answered that the people had to be ready for structural reforms and one had to proceed slowly and deliberately with , first , administrative reforms . I concluded at the time that he was in no hurry to push for reforms , but was struck when I heard this same incremental approach repeated in public statements by the regime in Damascus in the spring and summer of 2011 .
