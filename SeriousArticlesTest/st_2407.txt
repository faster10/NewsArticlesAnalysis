The Ukrainian president pleased with the respect shown to him by the president of the neighboring country relaxed and talked , which seldom happens to him . He said to the Moldovan president , but loud enough so the whole world heard , that for both Ukraine and Europe it would be useful to take a break from their relationship and to forget about each other for a while . Clearly Europe is tired of Ukraine but president Yanukovych has made it clear that Ukraine is sick of Europe , too . Moreover , neither Russia nor the United States are behaving in a humane way and also call for the release of the above mentioned Yulia Tymoshenko as if she was a common victim of judicial abuse .
