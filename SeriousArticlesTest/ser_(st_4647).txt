One explanation for the persistently high support for cannabis prohibition is the concern that ending the war on cannabis will result in increased use . Interestingly , comparisons between the U . S . and the Netherlands , where cannabis is de facto legalized , indicate that despite the U . S . ' s record rates of anti drug enforcement expenditures , 42 percent of U . S . adults report that they have used cannabis , which is more than twice as high as that observed in the Netherlands , where only 20 percent report a history of cannabis use .
