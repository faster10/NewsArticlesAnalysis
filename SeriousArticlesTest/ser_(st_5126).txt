By the time of the surrogacy , Logan had had a third child of her own , this time delivering at home , after two hospital births . Her homebirth experience had been so profound that it was actually a stipulation for her to do the surrogacy in the first place . Explains Tamara , " As you can imagine for my husband and me , getting on board with a homebirth was difficult because we had really needed the medical support of a hospital . But once I became educated about homebirth and the more the pregnancy progressed , the more we relaxed . We trusted Logan and Nathan , and that they knew what they were doing . I felt strongly that it was going to be OK . "
