Although it is not playing much of a role in the election , Turkey s policy towards the war in Syria has been a complete failure . Its aim was to get rid of Mr Assad and his regime , but both are still power . Even more seriously , whatever Ankara s intentions at the start of the conflict in 2011 , it did not dream that four years later the Syrian Kurds , 10 per cent of the Syrian population , would have established a de facto state they call Rojava in north east Syria which runs along half of Turkey s 550 mile Syrian Kurdish border . ?
