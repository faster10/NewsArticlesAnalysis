The goal that sparked it was something special . Winning the ball just inside his opponent ' s half , Ridgewell dribbled past two players , beat a third for pace and planted a left foot finish into the net . ' I ' m not the quickest in the world but I ' ve gone past him like Gareth Bale , ' he says . ' I scored one like it in a Stevie Bull testimonial for Aston Villa when I was 19 . No one has seen it . ' Cameras caught this effort , preserved for eternity online .
