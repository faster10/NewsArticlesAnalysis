Our global neighbors tend to go for what we do best , which is make big budget films with state of the art special effects , a minimum of dialogue ( explosions speak a universal language ) and lots of mayhem . Lots . Just to take two recent examples : the just opened X Men film has grossed 168 million in the U . S . , and twice that much overseas . And the new " Captain America " flick " Captain America , " no less ! has grossed 255 million domestically and a whopping 454 million overseas .
