Gupta : I do that because you ' re able to look at those things moving around you , you have much more window space , you ' re able to have a sense of what the driver ' s doing . So if the driver ' s hitting the brakes , you see that happening and it matches up with your inner ear . If you ' re sitting in the backseat and all of the sudden the driver hits the brakes , you get that queasy feeling in your stomach because your brain wasn ' t expecting that . Your inner ear is telling you that they hit the brakes , you know that it ' s happening , you may even clutch the hand rest and stuff , but it takes a second for your eyes to catch up . That whole process can make you motion sick .
