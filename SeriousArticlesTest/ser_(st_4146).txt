Rachel Nichols : It ' s complicated . That ' s part of the problem . That ' s why nobody ' s come up with some genius solution . Do you give them a stipend ? If you do , where does that money come from ? The athletic departments will tell you that the money they use that they get in from this tremendous revenue from football has gone to the women ' s lacrosse team or the men ' s gymnastics team . If they use some of that money to pay the football players , then the lacrosse team or the gymnastics team doesn ' t get equipment or they don ' t get funded anymore . Do they pay all athletes ? Does the lacrosse team also deserve payment ? Is it just the football team because that team earns revenue ? That doesn ' t mean we shouldn ' t pay these athletes . It doesn ' t mean that the answer should just be " we give up , " but I do think that it is more complicated than simply saying " they should get paid . "
