When Ginn is on the field , the Panthers are a different team and a better team . Much like Cam Newton s running , Ginn s pure speed is not always used but is always a threat . Safeties don t creep near the line of scrimmage with designs on stopping the run nearly as often when Ginn dances outside , ready to sprint 50 yards down the field again . Because of that , the defense has one fewer unblocked player trying to make a tackle on a Carolina running back .
