I don t know . I think there are a whole set of issues in Nepal which are primarily their own business . It is very easy in Nepal to blame India for Nepal s problems . Until they come to some accommodation among themselves , each one will either come to India and ask for help or blame us . Ultimately , we are so closely linked with our open border and in terms of economic interdependence and people that I am confident that it will work out . You could argue that there has been tactical clumsiness over the way it was done in the last few months , but that s not important when it comes to India Nepal relations . ( Khadga Prasad Sharma ) Oli ( Nepal PM ) said he will be visiting India . I believe ultimately good sense will prevail , though there will be patchiness in the relations for some time . We also have to lighten up and look at how far Nepal has come from a vicious 12 year insurgency .
