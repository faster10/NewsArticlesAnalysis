Let s hear it for the old guys . Sunday is championship round Sunday in the NFL playoffs and for the first time since 2004 the top two seeds in each conference , the league s four best regular season teams , do battle for a place in the Super Bowl . A rich feast of football is predicted , after a distinctly non vintage NFL year . But forget the details , that the near perfect Carolina Panthers and the Arizona Cardinals are meeting in the NFC title game , while the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos face each other for the AFC crown . Only one thing matters this weekend . For what surely will be the last time , it s Tom Brady versus Peyton Manning .
