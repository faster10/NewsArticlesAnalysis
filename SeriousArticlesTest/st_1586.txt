Describing the aftermath of Avery s exoneration , Beernsten writes , Steve was made out to be a hero , and I went from having sympathy to being this horrible person who made a mistake and is responsible for someone else s suffering . She also expresses frustration at the flawed methods the police used in leading her to identify Avery from a lineup , and their subsequent unwillingness to acknowledge their role in what happened . One of the things that really troubled me is that I was one of the only people who apologized to Steve , Beernsten writes . It would have been nice if the prosecutor and sheriff had said , Actually , we all got it wrong . I felt like I was the only one taking any responsibility .
