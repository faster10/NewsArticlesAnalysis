Trumbull : The important aspect of " 2001 " is it ' s designed to be a first person experience , very much of it . It ' s like ( the computer ) HAL ' s point of view . Kubrick wanted to get out of the way and not use traditional melodramatic production techniques . It ' s very much long shots that aren ' t much editorial intrusion . I think there ' s one that ' s 17 minutes long that ' s purely visual , with no dialogue , no suspense , nothing else , except the experience of you , the audience member , feeling like you ' re in space , going on this trip . That ' s first person cinema .
