" Now maybe if I lived in a place like New Hampshire , with your governor , I would feel okay about that . But if I lived in a state that had a Republican governor , particularly a Republican governor who already turned down Medicaid expansion matching funds , I don ' t think I would be comfortable , right ? Because I don ' t want to live in a country that has an unequal health care system again . "
