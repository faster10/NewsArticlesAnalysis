Weinfuss : Great question , and hard to answer . Despite Newton having more postseason experience than Palmer , neither has played in a conference championship game . On the one hand , I d say Palmer because he s older and more experienced . When the pressure is on , he s a quarterback who comes through in the clutch just look at how he led Arizona to an incredible overtime win over Green Bay last weekend . On the other hand , Newton is such a freak physically that I d want him to lead me to the Super Bowl . He s so dynamic and so dangerous he can run like a tailback but then throw a spot on dart down the field . Overall I d side with Palmer and not because I cover him , either . This is the type of game where nerves will be running high and whoever makes the biggest plays late will win . Palmer has proven he s more capable of that .
