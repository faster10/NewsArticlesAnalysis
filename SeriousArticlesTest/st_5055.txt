Lampe : It seems like because Instagram allows you to post as much as you want that you should post everything that you have . What works best is the idea of restraint : Which photos tell or continue your story the best way . I think portraits tell a story really well even if people don ' t read the caption below . For example , with the stories from Sandy , I was amazed that when I took peoples ' portraits , you could see almost the whole experience of the year in their eyes . I didn ' t see that until I went back and reviewed the photos .
