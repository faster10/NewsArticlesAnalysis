So I think it ' s about showing that and just having fun . I ' m really excited to compete . I ' ll be doing the sprint , the 5K and the 10K plus the biathlon . It ' s going to be extremely tough , cold , of course . But I ' m really excited for the transition . The coaches have been very supportive and really understanding and have a lot of patience for me , because I ' ve been spending a lot of time looking at the snow instead of actually skiing , but the transition has been so much fun .
