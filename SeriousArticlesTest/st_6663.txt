Gupta : They ' re all basically designed to prevent the nausea part of it . For the diaphoresis and the sweating and all that , they ' re not going to help you that much . You have different receptors histamine and muscarinic receptors . Once you have these chemicals released in your body for whatever reason , they trigger those receptors . Histamine will cause you to release acid into your stomach , it will cause your skin to turn red , it feels like an allergic reaction . Muscarinic is sort of a similar thing , it ' s a different type of receptor but it ' s similar . But they do the same thing , they sort of quiet your stomach , quiet some of the symptoms associated with motion sickness but they don ' t really take care of the cause of it in the first place .
