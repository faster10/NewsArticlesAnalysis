Then you have everyone else in fact , the strong majority of Americans who support comprehensive immigration reform , including a workable path to citizenship . This crowd certainly includes President Obama and Democrats , who have reiterated that passing immigration reform is one of their key legislative priorities . And it presumably includes leaders in the Republican Party , who want to curry favor with business interests and Latino voters who support fixing our nation ' s broken immigration system . So the question is : Do Republicans have the cojones to ignore the " cantaloupe caucus " and do the right thing ?
