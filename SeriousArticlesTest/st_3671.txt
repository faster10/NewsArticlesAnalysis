You don ' t need a tinfoil hat , here Murray isn ' t necessarily a Clinton shill . He might quite simply be participating in the same pattern of denial that conventional political wisdom has displayed about Sanders since he announced . Even so , somewhere within all of that denialism , there must be those who know precisely what they are doing when they apply a finger to the scales in these and other contexts . Those people know that Sanders is doing far , far better than the mainstream narrative would have us believe and if they are Clinton supporters ( really , who else could they be ) , they are running scared .
