No US highway hits more iconic national parks than US 89 , starting with Glacier near the Canadian border in Montana . Hugging the east side of the Rocky Mountains it passes Yellowstone at the Wyoming border and then drops down behind the iconic Grand Teton . In Utah it passes the mineral laced waters of the Great Salt Lake and in the south cuts between Zion and Bryce Canyon National Parks . Over the line in Arizona is the biggest spectacle of all , the Grand Canyon . Although US 89 officially ends at Flagstaff , you can follow its original route south through Tucson and Saguaro National Park to Nogales and the Mexican border .
