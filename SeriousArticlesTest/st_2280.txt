At the end the end of the day I know I ' m one of the better playmakers on this team . So I just got to do a better job of staying on the field and making sure I ' m helping my team , ' cause when I ' m not on the field I ' m not helping out and they need playmakers on the field and I am a playmaker . So just I got to do a better job of just being a reliable option in all areas so I can help out this team and be a playmaker . ?
