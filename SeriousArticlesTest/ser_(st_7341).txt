Trumbull : That ' s where the confusion has come up . When I talk about it , they think I ' m talking about a revival of Showscan , which it is not . I was contacted by the people who own Showscan about three years ago and they asked : ' Is there anything we can do with Showscan that would be a digital version of it ? ' And I said I do have an idea for an invention that would be a method whereby you could change the frame rate on any pixel or any character or any object or any scene . . . dynamically throughout any movie .
