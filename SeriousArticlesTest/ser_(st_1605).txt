Once in my New York hotel , I overheard some enigmatic conversations about Tate among the launch s organisers and then reread Boyd s ? short book . I decided to check out some of the detail in it . I went to inquire about Tate s life at Alice Singer s 57th Street gallery where Boyd wrote that he had first seen one of Tate s drawings . 57th Street indeed existed . Alice Singer s gallery did not . Nor did any of the other galleries referred to in the book . ?
