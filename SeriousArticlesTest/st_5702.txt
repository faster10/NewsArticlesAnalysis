" We need a history that ' s going to represent the righteousness of the American way , said historian John Kemp , colonial training specialist at Plimoth Plantation in Plymouth , Massachusetts . ? ? Intellectuals of the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries picked out the Pilgrims because they seemed a little more ' American ' than anyone else . ? And they seemed better than others , said Kemp . ? If you look at Jamestown Virginia , which , in fact , was the first English colony ? well , those guys had slaves . ? And in the Victorian period beginning in the mid 1800s , the slave states in the U . S . were seceding from the Union just prior to the Civil War and stirring up nasty things . ? So you didn ' t want your ' original ' Americans to be Jamestown settlers . ?
