The National Front , which also got the most votes in last year s European Parliament elections , is now the most popular party in France . It s getting much harder to dismiss the possibility that Le Pen could win next year s presidential election ? a remarkable shift for a party seen as an untouchable xenophobic fringe movement just a few years ago . Part of this shift is thanks to Le Pen s success in making the party more palatable to mainstream voters by cutting ties with her father , the party s founder , who embarrassed her with overt anti Semitism and jokes about the Holocaust . But the party s core nationalistic message has also undoubtedly gained more appeal as a result of the two horrifying Jihadist attacks in Paris this year . That s a cause for concern , and not just for France .
