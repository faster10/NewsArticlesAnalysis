Why this photograph , and not the one of the arguably more meaningful first flag placement , which was taken by Staff Sgt . Louis R . Lowery ? Its dynamic and masterful composition is part of the secret . The flag structures the picture , its diagonal back leaning position contrasting with the forward motion of the soldiers . They seem to rise out of the ash and other detritus of the battlefield , and there is already something sculptural in their massed bodies , in their muscular legs and arms that strain to hoist up the heavy pole . The leg of the lead bearer crosses the flagpole , adding a further sense of solidity .
