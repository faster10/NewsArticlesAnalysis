Then , I was at another class at the gym I belonged to , and the teacher didn ' t show up . There were a whole bunch of students in the room , and they said , " You should teach ! You ' re good at it , and you ' re always here . " So I it did it again , and it was fun . Then it just started unfolding for me . I started substitute teaching at Yoga Works for Shiva Rea and Seane Corn and Eric Schiffmann , which is really funny . These are big names in yoga . It was really funny at the time .
