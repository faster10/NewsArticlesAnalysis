What happens to the children left behind ? Some are institutionalized , and others are forced to live on the street or in refugee camps or as slaves to other families : for example , restaveks in Haiti . Children are bought and sold as prostitutes or forced into a life of crime , drug dealing and alcoholism , and many are child laborers making up a large part of the major work force of countries abroad . Still others become child soldiers fighting ethnic wars in tyrant run countries .
