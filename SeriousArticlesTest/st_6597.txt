This tiny little loud mouthed Jewish woman was my hero . When Joan Rivers walked through the curtain on " The Tonight Show , " nobody in my house was allowed to utter a sound . Her gait was full of pep and purpose and her voice unmatched . Her first appearance was in 1965 , when I was 3 . Johnny Carson called her over to the couch and whispered , " You ' re going to be a star . " She looked behind her to see if he was talking to someone else .
