Trump says he is in good health , but voters may have to take his word for it . Trump once said that all presidential candidates should release their medical records . But so far in the 2016 race , he has declined to release his , and a campaign spokeswoman has not responded to multiple requests for comment about the candidate ' s health records stretching back to October . While the health of a presidential candidate is always important , and nominees release their medical records as a matter of course , Trump ' s age , diet and self professed lack of workout regimen makes the issue more pressing in his case . If elected , the businessman would take office at the age of 70 , making him the oldest person ever to ascend to the presidency . Ronald Reagan was 69 at the time of his first inauguration . Hillary Clinton ? who , at 68 , is 16 months younger than Trump released a summary of her health records in July . Jeb Bush , 62 , and Chris Christie , 53 , each released records in October : Politico
