Bradley : I think the most crucial thing is picking your spots against him . When I m defending a shooter , I always think of what they do well and try to take that away from them . You want to keep them from getting into a rhythm or getting to the line , because I feel like that s what gets them going . That s something Curry excels at , finding those easy looks . Everyone worries about his perimeter shooting , but the backdoor layups can hurt you just as much .
