The obvious answer is the loss of Jordy Nelson . The Packers haven t found anyone else to give them the deep threat that has made Nelson one of the NFL s best receivers the last few seasons . But the Packers have enough other weapons to compensate , and they re guys who ve been in the system so finding a rhythm shouldn t be a problem . But it has been , which makes me think the larger problem is the play calling . ? Remember that Mike McCarthy gave up offensive play calling duties so he could be more involved with the defense and special teams , a definite trouble spot last year . Tom Clements knows Rodgers and the offense as well as anyone , having worked with Rodgers first as his quarterbacks coach and then as the offensive coordinator . But there s a creativity that is missing from Green Bay s game plan this year . McCarthy and Rodgers both said there was no need to make a change , but it s telling that McCarthy spent much of his week with the offense .
