Throw a dart in the AFC . The Patriots get the nod here because they have the best quarterback , and improved health at receiver and along the offensive line would provide a boost . The NFC seems to have a clearer divide ? it ' s the Panthers , Cardinals and Seahawks , then the rest ? and Arizona sure looks like a tough matchup for Carolina because of its ability to spread the field offensively . That ' s the only team the Cardinals would have to play on the road , and the Panthers might need to get past the Seahawks first . In an Arizona New England Super Bowl , the Cardinals ' speed and depth at receiver would stress the Patriots ' secondary , too .
