The atmosphere includes general circulations that are affected by each other , and by the dynamics of the ocean and rotation of the earth . Depending on the temperature , pressure and humidity of the air , clouds will form and eventually result in rain . Any anomaly can change the entire system . ( Just think of the Butterfly Effect , in which a small change such as a butterfly flapping its wings can affect something bigger , like a bird flying by , which can affect something even bigger , like an airplane , until a storm is formed . ) Once we find that anomaly , we can track it because we know how the surrounding circulations can affect it .
