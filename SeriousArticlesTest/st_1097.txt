Guiliano : The word that I found comes back over and over again in women ' s lives when it pertains to their professions is the word fear . They ' re afraid to make a move . They ' re afraid to take a job in another state or another city or another country . They ' re afraid to go for an interview . They ' re afraid to take a promotion because they might not be up to the job . It comes from our culture , of course , the low self esteem and low confidence we have , and we have to change that .
