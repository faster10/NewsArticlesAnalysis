The biggest challenge , the thing that you really would have liked to see not be an issue , would have been the Flint water situation . Again , that ' s not something you ' d ever want to see in terms of elevated lead levels , and as we were alerted to those issues , we became proactive and worked hard to address them by offering free water testing , free water filters , free blood testing , follow up work , helping in the transition back to the Great Lakes Water Authority . This whole issue , we ' ve gone into the schools now to do testing of the water down to the particular fixture . That surprised me that there was no federal or state requirement to do water testing in schools if you didn ' t happen to be on your own well . We found the issues tend to be isolated , actually , at the fixture . The drinking fountain itself . So the water doesn ' t have an issue in the system itself , coming in , and even throughout the school until it happens to hit a fixture that has particular problems , so far , in terms of what we ' ve found .
