The younger Manning and Romo seem like the most likely rivalry , what with the two of them playing in the same conference and , under ideal circumstances , meeting twice a year . However , with both cresting the hill at 35 years old , there s still a whole lot of ground between them . Cowboys fans will argue that Romo s 97 . 1 career passer rating puts Eli s 83 . 5 to shame ? with Manning s low completion percentage and high number of interceptions not looking great compared with Romo s . However , Giants fans will note that Manning s 44 , 000 yards far eclipses Romo s 34 , 000 , but they ll also rub in the fact that not only does Manning have two Super Bowl wins to Romo s 0 , but Romo basically opened the door to the Giants run to Super Bowl XLII in 2008 by throwing an interception in the end zone during their only playoff matchup .
