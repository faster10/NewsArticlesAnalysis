ISIS keeps coming , we know that , as if everything they have done so far , with televised executions and Russian planes blown out of the sky , is somehow just preamble . A week when there is great celebration in this country because we take out one of theirs , a masked executioner from the gates of hell known as Jihadi John , now ends with these innocent people slaughtered in Paris . And who knows how many more die on Friday night if the suicide bombers outside Stade de France somehow had gotten inside ?
