But most adults were like my folks . They were sacrificing , hardworking people who wanted one thing : a better life . Better for themselves , better for their children . My story is very similar to that of my partner , whose mother worked hard to feed him and his sister , and that meant peanut butter and jelly sandwiches everyday . Our stories are similar to that of Starbucks president Howard Schultz who grew up in the projects in Brooklyn and whose father never made more than 20 , 000 a year , or to that of William Jefferson Clinton , who started off as a poor kid from Arkansas and 46 years later was in the White House .
