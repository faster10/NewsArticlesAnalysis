Jennings : I would think that if you go that inward that even more demons would come up , but it was the opposite . I started doing a lot of yoga , pretty intensely , right when I started recording these songs . So I have a feeling that it was a big part of getting into my body getting physical and connecting with my spirit and allowing me to get free . It was a big part of this record , strangely , because the record is so dark and raw , but the whole time I knew I could handle it .
