Every quarterback gets worse in this situation , but Brady was way below the norm . The average quarterback posted a 15 . 2 QBR when pressured by a four man ( or fewer ) rush . Brady was all the way down at a QBR of 4 . 1 , which was 28th among the 35 qualifying passers this year . It also happened relatively frequently , as 19 percent of Brady ' s dropbacks ended with him being pressured without a blitz , which was the ninth highest percentage in football .
