Hill shouldn t take that on himself . Burfict targets players for injury . Karma s not going to let someone like that get the INT that seals the game . It s unfortunate that Hill was the instrument for Pittsburgh getting back the ball . But Burfict s brutal behavior is what put the Steelers back in FG range , and Jones s lack of discipline made it a short kick . None of that was on Hill . The team s problem players created the team s problems .
