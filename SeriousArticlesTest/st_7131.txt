Which free agents will be priorities to re sign ? Unlike last offseason , when Revis , running back Shane Vereen and defensive tackle Vince Wilfork were among the significant free agent departures , the Patriots don ' t have the same caliber of players set to hit the market this year . Running back LeGarrette Blount , defensive tackle Akiem Hicks and special teams standout Nate Ebner are the top three free agents , and Hicks based on his size ( 6 5 , 324 ) , physical traits , the value of the position he plays and his age ( 26 ) is in line for the richest contract . The Patriots presumably would like him to return , but as is often the case , the market will dictate whether it happens .
