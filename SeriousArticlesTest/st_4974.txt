" Tonight , the machinery of death in Virginia extinguished the beautiful , childlike and loving human spirit of Teresa Lewis . . . " Rocap said . " Teresa asked that I send her thanks and love to all of those who have supported her in this fight for her life . In her words , ' It ' s just awesome . ' It is our hope that Teresa ' s death will cause a re examination of the badly broken system of justice that could allow something as wrong and unjust as this to happen . "
