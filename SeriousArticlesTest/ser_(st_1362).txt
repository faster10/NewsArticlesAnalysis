How can Hollywood be so liberal , but seem blind to the fact that excellence in film comes in all colors ? The industry certainly gets that superbness comes in all sexual orientations . Let s be honest , the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ? community has gained more ground in Hollywood over the past decade than black folk have covered in 50 years . The evidence is plentiful : We see gay characters on hit TV shows and in more than a few Academy nominated roles this year . ? Not to mention the prominent presence of gay executives in the upper echelons of Hollywood film studios . ? To be clear , I m unequivocally ? in favor of expanding rights and opportunities for all . ? But , clearly , Hollywood doesn t seem nearly as interested in equal opportunity . ? How can arguably the most progressive community in America ? be so slow to recognize and revel in the humanity and talent of its black members ?
