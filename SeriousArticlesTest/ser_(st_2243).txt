Talk about unlikely heroes . Colon had not appeared in any of Kansas CIty ' s previous 15 postseason games , yet he got the call with the go ahead run at third base in Game 5 of the World Series . With the game in the 12th inning , Ned Yost ' s bench was running pretty thin , but like most of the buttons he pushed during the postseason , it worked . Colon stepped up , looking like a cool , calm and collected veteran , and came through , lacing an RBI single to left field . When pinch runner Jarrod Dyson touched home , Kansas City had the run it needed to win the World Series .
