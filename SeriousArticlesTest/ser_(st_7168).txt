On Jan . 23 , I filmed my question at the Youtube Space in Los Angeles , California for the Republican debate . My question , originally intended for Donald Trump , was powerful and direct . I was proud of my delivery and even more proud of YouTube , Google , and Fox News for welcoming a fresh perspective to the debate . This was huge for me , my family , our community , and this country . This was an opportunity to start a dialogue on an important issue .
