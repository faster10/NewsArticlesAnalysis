" We pull from the environment , " said drummer Perkins . " Jane ' s Addiction wrote our ( first ) music in Hollywood in 1986 . You hear Los Angeles . You hear that Mexico is only 100 miles away from us . You can hear the struggle , and also the glory , of being a musician in L . A . Our music was never negative , but it had that strong urge . You wanted to go f k , not to go punch . And I think Jane ' s still has that . "
