" Alan Rickman is undoubtedly one of the greatest actors I will ever work with . He is also , one of the loyalest and most supportive people I ' ve ever met in the film industry . He was so encouraging of me both on set and in the years post Potter , " he wrote . " I ' m pretty sure he came and saw everything I ever did on stage both in London and New York . He didn ' t have to do that . I know other people who ' ve been friends with him for much much longer than I have and they all say ' if you call Alan , it doesn ' t matter where in the world he is or how busy he is with what he ' s doing , he ' ll get back to you within a day .
