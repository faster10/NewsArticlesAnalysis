( On where he feels the offensive line is at right now : ) Well I think it s still a work in progress . I don t think we ve nailed it yet . I think this needs to be a really competitive spot again , and we re going to work really hard to build it up . For the course of the season we weren t consistent enough . We found a real good rhythm , but we can t start and go through that again . We don t want to have to experience that if we can avoid it . I think that s a real area of focus again , so we ll be talking about it . We ve got a couple unrestricted guys there , we re going to have to deal with how that s going to work out . There s just stuff that we re going to have to work through . But we are young , and we are athletic , and we do like our guys . I like the fact that Mark Glowinski got a chance to play . We ll see how all that works out , and it ll be exciting . It s a really important area for us , of course .
