The Rams ' quarterback situation has been a mess all season and really , the only reason to watch them this season has been to see Todd Gurley run and to see the Rams defense smash people . Sadly , neither of those things were watchable . Gurley only totaled 41 yards and the Rams defense was shredded for 524 yards , the second most yards St . Louis has given up since 1997 . If that ' s not ugly enough , the Rams were also ugly on third down , converting only 1 of 12 attempts .
