There ' s some evidence that the unnamed candidates score worse in this survey than in other polls where all the candidates are included . For example , in the six NBC News Wall Street Journal polls conducted since April , these five candidates never broke 2 percent . Two of them ? Santorum and Jindal ? reached 1 percent twice , while Pataki reached 1 percent just once . ( All five , however , are at 0 percent in the most recent NBC News WSJ poll that Fox Business included . )
