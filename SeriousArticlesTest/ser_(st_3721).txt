Andre Geim : It ' s the thinnest material you can get it ' s only one atom thick . A tiny amount can cover a huge area , so one gram could cover a whole football pitch . It ' s the strongest material we are aware of because you can ' t slice it any further . Of course , we know that atoms can be divided into elementary particles , but you can ' t get any material that is thinner than one atom , or it wouldn ' t count as a material anymore .
