Khan will doubtlessly revive the Pakistani film industry , which has hit a long trough after General Zia ul Haq s pious decade in the 1980s . I have no doubt he will appreciate that he can t be cavorting around in them with half naked heroines , the way he does in vulgar India . Pakistanis , who flock to cinemas to see his films , turn their faces away when such love scenes come on . I hear Indian filmgoers , too , will soon observe such pieties .
