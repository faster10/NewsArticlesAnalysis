The simple truth is that no governor in the 50 states would accept such an assault on American citizens . The state ' s delegation would fight it , and such unfair , pernicious cuts simply wouldn ' t be accepted . The same is happening in Puerto Rico , but we have no delegation , no seat at the table when decisions are made , no votes in the federal government that makes our laws . This is perhaps the ultimate price we pay because of our territorial status . If Puerto Rico were a state , we would have full parity in all federal programs , including Medicaid .
