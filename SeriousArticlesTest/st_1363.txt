Is being snubbed by the academy the real problem ? ? I ve had more than one white academy member say to me that the Oscars are about rewarding the best actors in the best films , regardless of race , and that some years black actors just don t turn in the best performances . ? I couldn t agree more . In any given year , the best performers might be white . And even then , some of the white ones get overlooked . ? ( Think Ridley Scott , director of The Martian , and Emily Blunt in Sicario . ) ? Art is subjective , and snubbed is such a loaded term .
