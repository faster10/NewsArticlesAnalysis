Two part track : Look , Ma , no spikes ! A new surface on the Olympic track in London means runners won ' t have to wear spiked shoes . " Unlike other track designs that combine traction and shock absorption in an upper layer of rubber granules , the Mondo track separates these functions , with a cushion backing for shock absorption and a solid upper layer that optimizes slip resistance , traction and durability , " the BBC writes . " This design cuts the need for the spikes on athletes ' running shoes to penetrate the running surface . "
