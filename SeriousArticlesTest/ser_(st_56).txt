The Eagles knocked off the New England Patriots on Sunday , and a big reason why is because of their play on special teams . They blocked a punt for a touchdown and returned another for a score , which ultimately helped lift them to victory . Additionally , they recovered a drop kick by the Patriots , giving them good field position which they turned into a touchdown . The Bills will need to limit the Eagles ' special teams , particularly return man Darren Sproles , if they want to win this one .
