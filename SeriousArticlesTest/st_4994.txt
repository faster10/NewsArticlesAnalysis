" Who Knew , " the opening track , gains an ominous intensity : " Who knew Not me , not you or anyone else Come to think of it , it ' s true We ' re misinformed and always warned to look out Who knew , " he sings , a lonely sax moaning behind his voice . ( Listen to " Who Knew " in the MP3 box under Cale ' s photo . )
