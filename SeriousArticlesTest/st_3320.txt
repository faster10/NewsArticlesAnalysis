Sometimes I would have to hurry home to get my homework done before nightfall and an unpaid electric bill put the house in the dark . We depended on the cinder blocks of cheese , powdered milk and canned meats encased in saturated fat that the government distributed . School clothes shopping typically began and ended at Goodwill .

Most everyone I encountered on my block was poor .
