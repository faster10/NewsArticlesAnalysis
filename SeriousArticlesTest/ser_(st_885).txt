Then there ' s the matter of field position . This is again not something that is often considered , but intuitively , you know a team is more likely to score when starting a drive in its opponent ' s territory as opposed to its own , or when starting from the 40 yard line as opposed to the 5 . The average Green Bay drive began on the 28 . 3 yard line through the first six weeks of the season . Over the last five weeks , it ' s been the 26 . 1 yard line . That 2 . 2 yard difference isn ' t massive , but it is the difference between the ninth best starting field position and the 23rd best . Given that estimates have played 10 yards of field position as being worth less than a point , it ' s not likely that the 2 . 1 yard difference in drive starting position has had much effect on the Packers ' output .
