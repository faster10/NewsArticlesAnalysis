According to a report by Dylan Scott at Talking Points Memo , a Seattle woman named Donna received a cancellation letter from her insurance company regarding her current plan . The letter steered Donna and her family into a more expensive option and said , " If you ' re happy with this plan , do nothing . " The letter made no mention of the Washington State insurance exchange , where Donna could find plenty of other more affordable choices , because the company wanted a convenient excuse to jack up Donna ' s rates .
