This month , Britain ' s Channel 4 broadcast a new documentary on the historical origins of Islam , written and narrated by the distinguished classicist Tom Holland and based on Holland ' s previous book on the subject . Holland ' s book and documentary presented in accessible form the fruits of recent scholarship , widely accepted by leading academic authorities . That research points to Islam originating in Syria , not Arabia points to parts of the Quran being translated from other languages , especially Aramaic and points to the probability that Islam coalesced as a religion after the conquest of Mesopotamia and Persia rather than beforehand . As I mentioned , these are not new insights , but to date they have been published mostly by academics in books written for academics .
