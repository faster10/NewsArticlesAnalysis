One name to remember is Kirsten Gillibrand , a Democratic senator from New York . She is 45 and not only is she firmly ensconced in her political career , she ' s also the mother of two sons , ages 9 and 5 . Gillibrand is on at least one short list ( if Hillary Clinton keeps her word about not running for president again ) of potential Democratic candidates for the White House in 2016 . With the launch of her recent bipartisan Off the Sidelines project to encourage more women to run for office , as well as her online book club , it certainly looks like she ' s laying the social media groundwork for something in four years .
