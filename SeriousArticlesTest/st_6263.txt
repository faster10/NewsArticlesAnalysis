There is good evidence that sanctions are working . The Russian economy is already suffering from low global prices for its No . 1 export ? oil ? and the E . U . and U . S . sanctions have further inhibited investment , as well as the availability of imported goods . The Russian economy is in recession , and its budget deficit in 2016 is predicted to be somewhere around 3 percent . Why would we want to hand the Russian government a lifeline now , or in any way reward bad international behavior ?
