This season s unpredictable Premier League title race took yet another twist in midweek , as Claudio Ranieri s fearless Leicester City side consolidated their unlikely position as league leaders . But just five points separate the top four and the highly competitive nature of the division means Leicester have by far the lowest points per game average of any of the leaders of the top five leagues in Europe just 2 . 08 compared to the continent best of 2 . 74 by Paris St Germain in France . Now the Foxes face a severe test of their title potential as they visit Manchester City and Arsenal in successive matches but if they can come out of those two matches with their confidence largely intact , then they could soon be thought of title favourites for the first time . Man City haven t lost to Leicester in more than 12 years and they will expect that run to continue on Saturday , but writing off Ranieri s team has become a dangerous game . Prediction : Man City 2 Leicester 1 .
