" I don ' t even want to touch on the topic of ' black quarterback , ' " Newton said . " I think this game is bigger than black , white , or even green . I think we limit ourselves when we just label ourselves just black , this , that or the third . I want to bring awareness because of that , but yeah , I don ' t think I should be labeled just a black quarterback . There are bigger things in this sport that need to be accomplished . "
