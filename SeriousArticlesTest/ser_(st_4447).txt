In 1979 , when the one child policy was introduced , China ' s population was just under one billion . The following year , the government projected the population would reach 1 . 2 billion by 2000 , at which point the country would achieve its target of zero population growth . In actuality , China hit that number of people seven years too early , and its population now stands at a little shy of 1 . 4 billion and growing . However , the government estimates the one child policy has prevented 400 million births and has helped lift countless families out of poverty by easing the strain on the country ' s limited resources . Many demographers counter that the birthrate would have fallen anyway as China ' s economy developed and education levels rose .
