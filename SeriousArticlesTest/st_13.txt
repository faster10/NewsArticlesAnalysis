Bush is simply the latest in a long line of politicians whose candidacies demonstrate that all the money in the world won ' t make people buy a bad product . Consider former eBay executive Meg Whitman , who spent 140 million in her bid to beat Jerry Brown in the California governor ' s race in 2010 . The more she spent , the less voters liked her . Or take Dave Brat , the barely known Virginia college professor who spent less on his successful Republican primary challenge to former House majority leader Eric Cantor than Cantor ' s campaign spent on meals at steakhouses . There ' s no easy correlation between money spent on politics and electoral outcomes .
