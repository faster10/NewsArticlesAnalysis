Francis starts his trip in Nairobi , where he will visit the Kangemi settlement , one of the city s poorest neighbourhoods . He will meet congregants of the Jesuit led parish of St Joseph s the Worker , where he has reportedly instructed no special arrangements should be made for his visit . We will not give him gold or silver . Our richness will be in the form of the congregants that this church was set up to reach . We will have the poor , the sick , the needy seated right next to him . It is they we will present as our riches , Peter Magu , chair of the Catholic Men s Association , told the Standard newspaper .
