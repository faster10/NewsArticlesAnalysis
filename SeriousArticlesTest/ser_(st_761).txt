I think beast mode had probably 2 3 very good years in him , if you watch him run and play he looks faster than I can every remember just has had some unfortunate injuries like this abdomin thing and his back spams . You can t look from afar and think you know how Lynch is bc his numbers are down . Whose wouldn t playing hurt or not playing at all ? He s simply had a down year with minor injuries when he s healthy he s still beast mode and still a top 2 3 back .
