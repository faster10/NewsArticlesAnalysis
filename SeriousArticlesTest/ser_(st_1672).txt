In an age obsessed with antiheroes , it made sense that Bond would evolve in this direction . The attempts to humanize 007 have long felt inspired by Christopher Nolan s Batman movies , but it was the portentousness and self seriousness of Nolan ? and not the technical skill ? that had leaked into the franchise s filmmaking . Rather than a man without a past , Bond became a man who could not outrun his past . If you are going to present modern audiences with a misogynistic , violent hero , you better make him a tortured soul .
