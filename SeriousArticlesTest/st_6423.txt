In the past years while reading scripture , I often paused at the directive to visit those in prison . Deep in my core was the question , mingled with fear : How , who , why ? Today I have learned to walk without shame , boldly and compassionately , through the corridors of bars and locks and have a newfound perspective for those imprisoned . Incarceration of a loved one is a heart wrenching , soul searching experience that can debilitate , consume and potentially destroy both the captive and his free loved ones .
