We don t need to build them up to show that we re serious , nor do we need to push away vital allies in this fight by echoing the lie that ISIL is representative of one of the world s largest religions . We just need to call them what they are ? killers and fanatics who have to be rooted out , hunted down , and destroyed . ( Reuters Photo )
