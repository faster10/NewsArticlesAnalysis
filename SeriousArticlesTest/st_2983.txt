This is the prize for Rubio if he wins the nomination and strikes out in a new direction . There is a clear risk , since those angry voters flocking to hear Trump speak might stay at home on polling day rather than endorse another establishment figure . But it is hard to see any alternative strategy leading to success ? even if Clinton reverts to her cautious former style of triangulation and trouble avoidance . It should not be forgotten David Cameron s surprise majority involved the party s biggest share of ethnic minority support . ?
