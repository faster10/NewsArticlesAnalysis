So the economic case for the U . K . leaving the EU is actually strong . But there are more serious , structural problems with EU membership . The EU project is in many ways a noble one , and has had some significant accomplishments to its name , but its rejection of democracy and accountability has rendered it morally bankrupt . The EU project has beclowned itself time and time again . EU elites have demonstrated their own incompetence and untrustworthiness thanks to the euro project , which has mired the continent in economic crisis ? and they have responded to the crisis by admitting nothing , apologizing for nothing , and grabbing even more power . National sovereignty matters . Nations have the right to set their own rules , and the EU needs a swift rebuke . The British people should give it to them .
