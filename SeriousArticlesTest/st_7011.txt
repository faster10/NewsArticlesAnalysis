I hope fans will be intrigued by this news , pick up the issues in July and realize they ' ve been given one of the best comics on the stands . They ' ll be handed a piece of comic book history , featuring some of the most well known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon . We want fans to talk about this for years to come . We think this story is bigger than anything we ' ve ever done . It ' s bold , dramatic and best of all , a fitting end to the life of Archie .
