Lacking a better option , I ' ll stick with Seattle , my preseason pick . The Seahawks certainly have issues ? start with having to win three road playoff games to nail down a third consecutive NFC title ? but so does every team in the postseason field . But outside of a Week 16 lapse to the St . Louis Rams , the Seahawks have arguably looked like the class of the NFC for nearly two months . Russell Wilson has clearly shed the game manager label ? I ' d argue he did that in 2014 ? and the defense has regained its dominant form , the capstone being a stifling performance against the NFC West champion Cardinals in Week 17 . And if Marshawn Lynch is able to contribute coming off abdominal surgery ? Look out . As for the AFC , every team almost seems fatally flawed in some way . But given the battered Patriots ' increasing inability to protect Tom Brady , hard to see them potentially overcoming Denver ' s dominant defense in the Mile High City .
