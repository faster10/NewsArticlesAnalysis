New Yorkers might take scads of robust independently owned stores in stride , but for Americans who have been chainstored over the past decade , it ' s as much of a sight to behold as an open air museum about colonial times . Spoonbill , like many of the shops in the neighborhood , is among the best in the country in what it does . Same can be said for Main Drag Music , an instrument shop up the street . Same with Mikey ' s Hookup , the local electronics shop . Or the local bike shops . The " small businessmen " we hear so much about in election years are thriving in Williamsburg .
