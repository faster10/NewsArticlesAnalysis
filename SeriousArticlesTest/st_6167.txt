Let us call upon Him for continued guidance and assistance in all our endeavors . And let us ever be mindful of the faith and spiritual values that have made our Nation great and that alone can keep us great . In 2004 , President George W . Bush wrote : We are grateful for our freedom , grateful for our families and friends , and grateful for the many gifts of America .
