" An October 2 news report indicates that Bryant , who apparently lives in DeSoto , may have acquired an infant capuchin monkey . If he is found to be in illegal possession of this monkey , please seize the monkey and ensure that he or she is placed in a reputable sanctuary . PETA stands ready to assist with the placement of the animal . "
