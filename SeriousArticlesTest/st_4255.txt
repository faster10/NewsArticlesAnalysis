It ' s emotional journalism . It ' s the closest thing to having Kurt tell his own story in his own words by his own aesthetic , his own perception of the world . It paints a portrait of a man attempting to cope with being a human . When Brett and I first met , I was very specific about what I wanted to see , how I wanted Kurt to be represented . I told him , " I don ' t want the mythology of Kurt or the romanticism . " Even though Kurt died in the most horrific way possible , there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him , because he ' s 27 forever . The shelf life of an artist or musician isn ' t particularly long . Kurt has gotten to icon status because he will never age . He will always be that relevant in that time and always be beautiful .
