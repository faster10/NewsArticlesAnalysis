I ve always been a movie and TV show junkie : from back in the day , renting VHS cassettes of the classic Knight Rider series from the local video library , to catching every one of those Better Call Saul episodes and Jessica Jones of late , there are many like me who need that fix of good video . And when it comes to catching the latest international movies or TV shows , the only real ( legal ) avenue we had was when they were aired on cable and DTH channels . Of course , in our markets Torrenting is also an oft exercised option .
