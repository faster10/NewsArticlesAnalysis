Finally , it ' s nice to see institutionalized homophobia crumbling . First it was the military , with the repeal of don ' t ask , don ' t tell . For decades , the argument had been that having openly gay people in the military would impair unit cohesion . Setting aside all the flawed assumptions that undergird those fears , you know what has happened to unit cohesion since the fall of don ' t ask , don ' t tell ? It ' s stayed the same or gotten slightly better . This is probably because it ' s easier for people to bond when they ' re not forbidden from being themselves .
