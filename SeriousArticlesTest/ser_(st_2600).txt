In the grand scheme of things we need to go to Homestead and we need to have a good day and do what we did there last year ? ? ? just run around and stay out of trouble , run fifth ? ? ? that would be just fine . When you look at the averages and points gained versus our needed position to finish our window is getting bigger as we go through these last four races , so that makes me feel good as we go to Homestead . Even though they gained some points , honestly , unless something crazy happens at Homestead it ' s just not gonna be enough .
