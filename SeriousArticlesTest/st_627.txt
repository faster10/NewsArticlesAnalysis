This line saw some movement early in the week , as the Redskins opened as one point favorites before odd smakers adjusted it due to an influx of bets on Green Bay . They still possess more overall talent then Houston , though , and have allowed just 12 . 8 points per game during their 10 game winning streak . But in the end , the Redskins offense has been humming down the stretch and should be able to consistently move the ball and score against the Packers . They managed to be the third ranked offense with Ben Roethlisberger out of the lineup for 4 . 5 weeks . This will be a great test of playoff experience . Washington has benefited in recent weeks from some bad opponents , and while the Packers are a better team , they are still not a particularly good team right now . The defense is firing on all cylinders , and quarterback Russell Wilson is playing some of the best football of his career .
