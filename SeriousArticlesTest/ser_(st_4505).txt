Both , the Novartis verdict and compulsory licensing , have been landmark decisions . After having lost in Indian courts , pharma giants started lobbying with their respective governments to use other means to pressure India to amend its patent law . The result of this lobbying is visible in recent years in several bilateral and multi lateral forums . In the negotiations of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) trade agreement , developed countries are trying to sneak in clauses that favour evergreening . RCEP includes India , China , Japan , South Korea , Australia , New Zealand and the ASEAN group of countries . Japan and South Korea have proposed clauses for data exclusivity that would allow companies to get monopoly by restricting the ability of generic drug manufacturers unless they replicate clinical trials , which is a costly process . The American government has been pressurising India to introduce changes that prevent issuing of compulsory licenses , through instruments like Congressional hearings and International Trade Commission investigations . The European Union too is pushing for data exclusivity and patent term extensions under the free trade agreement with India . Another group of four European countries ? Switzerland , Norway , Iceland and Lichtenstein ? who make up the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) want India to promote free trade .
