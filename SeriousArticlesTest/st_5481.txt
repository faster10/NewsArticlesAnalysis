Buzzfeed also found a comment Cole made on his January 29 post . It read ' I ' m all too worried about the deportables , as you know . I am doing , however , my absolute best to put as many Black criminals who live and loiter on my street behind bars . And if I found any White , Hispanic , Arab , Aleutian , Islander , or other such race causing mischief in my neighborhood , I would pursue their arrest , prosecution , and imprisonment as well . '
