In towns , you may have to cross over the center line just to get past parked cars . Sometimes both directions of traffic can pass parked cars simultaneously , but frequently you ' ll have to take turns follow the locals ' lead and drive defensively .

Return the favor when you are closer to a wide spot in the road than they are .
