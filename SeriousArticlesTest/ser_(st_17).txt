We have to huddle up and decide if there is going to be anything different in terms of minutes , Lakers GM Mitch Kupchak said . It s not something that s going to be decided today . But since he has made it clear this will be the last season for him , it will be more enjoyable and I think people can appreciate and will appreciate what he s accomplished , not only in our building ? with loads of love ? but even more so on the road .
