I just think that at times we take for granted how talented we are as a whole and with all the guys upon this roster , Butler said . We think we can come out and just go through the motions at the beginning of a game , dig ourselves a little hole and think we can just pick it up at any point and time , and it just doesn t work like that . You gotta come out from the jump and try and beat a team for the whole 48 minutes . I think we ve been really good from the start of games these past few games , and come up short in a few , but I think if we keep pushing , keep playing hard all the time , we re going to win games .
