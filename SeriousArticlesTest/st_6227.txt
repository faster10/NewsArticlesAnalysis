The trip is Francis s first visit to Africa . According to John Allen , associate editor of Crux : It s an opportunity for him to say as pope that Africa is very important to the Catholic church . It s where Catholicism is growing most rapidly , and it s a chance for him to show some love . But it s also an opportunity for him to learn , to put in some time on the ground . The trip had a strong interfaith dimension , Allen added , sending a strong signal in places where religious conflict is a powerful force . In CAR , Francis will speak both as a diplomatic troubleshooter and as a pastor , arguing not just on political grounds but religious and theological grounds .
