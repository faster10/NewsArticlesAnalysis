There ' s speculation the man himself may swing by the Ollie Hayes Inn for a pint of Guinness . Ollie Hayes says he ' s had the CIA come through some months back but there ' s still no certainty that it ' ll actually happen .

" Who knows , " says Henry Healy who I meet in the pub , " we may all have to join him and raise a glass to his re election campaign in 2012 . "
