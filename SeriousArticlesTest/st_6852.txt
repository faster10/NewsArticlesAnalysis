It bears remembering that Rickman ? he of Truly , Mad , Deeply , ? Sense and Sensibility ? and Harry Potter , ? who was just as convincingly villainous in " Die Hard " as he was hilariously deadpan in Galaxy Quest , ? he who so recently offered a tutorial in film acting in a viral YouTube video ? was nominated for an Oscar only once . He didn ' t win and , judging from the span , range and virtuosity on display throughout his career , it couldn ' t have mattered less .
