The truth is that my daughter may well be the best dressed in her class . She has a terrific sense of style . One day she put on a hand me down Disney princess outfit , looked in the mirror and said , " OK Dad , I ' m ready to dig for worms ! " Another day , she went to school in a pink dress , green rain boots and a viking helmet . I frequently come home to find her in a pirate costume . She ' s practical and became outraged when she discovered that her " girl jeans " turned out to have fake pockets . " Daddy , " she said , " Where am I going to put my pine cones ? " If she ' s the best dressed , it ' s because of her creativity .
