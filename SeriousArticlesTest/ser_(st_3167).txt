There s been a lot of forwards who could push the ball and distribute ? Grant Hill , Scottie Pippen types , Kerr said . Most of those guys were three men . He s a four . He guards fours . He guards fives . So I don t remember anybody who checked all the boxes like Draymond has for us . Some of that is the game has changed , so the fours that you guard now are a lot different than the fours you would have had to guard 20 years ago . But his game is perfectly suited for modern NBA .
