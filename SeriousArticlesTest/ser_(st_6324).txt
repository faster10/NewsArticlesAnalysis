Chris : But here ' s the thing . There have been gay athletes before . We know this because several of them have come out ( Jason Collins while active , others after they were done playing ) . Simple statistics say there have to have been many others that never came out . And yet , somehow , there ' s never been a single reported incident of one athlete sexually assaulting another athlete , whether it ' s in the shower or anywhere else in the locker room .
