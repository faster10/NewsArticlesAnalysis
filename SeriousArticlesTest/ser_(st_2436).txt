Unlike in Pennebaker s Dont Look Back ( 1967 ) , an account of Bob Dylan s 1965 British tour , there s no downtime in hotel rooms or limos where Bowie can relax and just be himself ( when Dylan does this , he is even more of an enigma ) . Instead , everything is performance , and Pennebaker s camera is caught up in the whirlwind of the music , the taunting striptease of wardrobe and personae . Before each costume change , the screen goes black and Bowie is back in the dressing room , where assistants take off one Ziggy carapace , revealing the pale pupa of his scrawny body , and replace it with another .
