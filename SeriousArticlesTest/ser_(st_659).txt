In his opening statement , Gowdy tried to shoot down allegations that the committee was focused on Clinton . There are people frankly in both parties who have suggested that this investigation is about you , Gowdy said to Hillary at the outset . Let me assure you it is not .

Gowdy used the volume of emails sent from Blumenthal to Clinton to portray him as a key advisor who had unfettered access to Clinton , and contrasted him with slain Libya ambassador Chris Stevens , who never emailed Clinton directly . Help us understand how Sidney Blumenthal had that kind of access to you , Madame Secretary , but the ambassador did not , Gowdy asked with much gravity .
