' We batted together in a Twenty20 tournament at Millfield and he walked down the wicket to me in one game and said " I ' m going to try to hit this guy over point for six " . In my naivety I wondered how he was going to cut the ball for six , but the next ball he came down and he said : " I ' m going to reverse sweep him for six " . And that ' s exactly what he did . It was pretty amazing .
