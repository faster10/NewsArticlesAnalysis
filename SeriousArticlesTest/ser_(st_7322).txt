This movie is set in the US and it does not have the same sort of brutal Euro hardcore feel . Arguably , Schleinzer s film is a truer representation of the subject . But that doesn t mean Room is in some way evasive or emollient . Not at all . It keeps a clear , cold gaze on what is happening and shows that , just as this Room is a part of an unsuspected universe beyond , so the mother s nightmarish existence is part of an extended , complex situation involving her mother ( Joan Allen ) , her father ( William H Macy ) and her mother s new boyfriend ( Tom McCamus ) .
