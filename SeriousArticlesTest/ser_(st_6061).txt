Trump raised millions from himself and some other millionaires and smaller donors for the veterans , who he loves . Curiously , the money all went to ? donaldtrumpforvets . com , a website set up that morning which routes the money to the Donald Trump Foundation . One assumes he means to send it on to veterans groups but as of last night , the press was unable to confirm that he had contacted any of them . Anti Trump right wingers are up in arms that this foundation has donated to the Clinton Foundation in the past which apparently means this is a nefarious deed of some sort .
