On Sunday , Bryant announced his plans to retire at the end of this season in a letter in the Players Tribune titled Dear Basketball . Never one for subtlety , Bryant s letter touches on his longstanding love of the game and provides a forum for him to remind fans that he gave it his all , From my mind body , To my spirit and soul . Yet the most surprising aspect of the missive isn t the poetic prose or the stark descriptions of hustling for loose balls , but the fact that it reveals that Bryant has decided to wait until the end of the season , as opposed to the NBA All Star break or right now , to retire . Considering how poorly Bryant is playing ? he s arguably the worst regular player on the 2 ? 14 Los Angeles Lakers ? it would be understandable if he decided to hang up his jersey right now and stop subjecting himself and his fans to such awful displays of basketball .
