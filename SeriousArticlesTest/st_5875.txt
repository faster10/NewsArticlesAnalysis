Morello : The first Nightwatchman album is called " One Man Revolution . " It ' s not a misnamed album . I was the only black kid in an all white town . Then I was the only radical student in a conservative high school . Then I was the only rock ' n ' roll guitar player at Harvard University . Then I was the only dude with a Harvard diploma in a Hollywood rock ' n ' roll band . So in some ways , there ' s always been a sense of aloneness .
