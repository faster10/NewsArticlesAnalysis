It ' s Vardy ' s hold up play that wins the free kick for the first Leicester goal . His pace and persistence that hounded Joleon Lescott into giving him the ball as he drove Leicester forward and helped win the corner for the second goal . And it was his strength that won the ball off Gareth MacAuley on the halfway line then you can only admire his storming surge towards goal and the quality finish as he rifles the ball into the back of the net for the winner in injury time , embarrassing Lescott again .
