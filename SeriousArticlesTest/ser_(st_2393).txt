No team is worse at defending the pass than the Giants this season , allowing a league high 309 . 2 yards per game through the air . The Jets don ' t have the best aerial attack , but Eric Decker and Brandon Marshall have elevated the play of Ryan Fitzpatrick and have become one of the best wide receiver duos in the NFL . Dominique Rodgers Cromartie has the size to match up with Decker and Marshall , but he won ' t be able to cover both players all game long .
