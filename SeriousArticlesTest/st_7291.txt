How can any fan complain about Porter being on the field , after seeing the screen shot of 9 Bengal coaches on the field ? You see it every game when a player is seriously injured , coaches come on to the field players come on to the field . I get it , you believe that it s porters fault burfict and jones made their boneheaded decisions . Your looking for a reason why those two players lost control . But when you watch the whole 22 video , you see it s burfict and gillberry who initiate the contact with Porter . There were 3 refs standing right there and not one of them gave any indication Porter said or did anything to provoke gillberry and burfict or jones . The argument just doesn t hold water when you review the bengals coaches on the field , and the fact it happens every game .
