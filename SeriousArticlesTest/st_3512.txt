The movie opens in 1974 , when Jobs is a shaggy , barefoot college dropout . He picks up on the inventiveness of his friend , Steve Wozniak ( Josh Gad ) , who has figured out how to hook up a keyboard to a television monitor . Jobs then fast talks ( or is it strong arms ? ) his way into a deal to sell 50 of these contraptions to a local retailer . They ' ve got just two months to build the machines , and the film neatly re enacts the eager beaver , geek in the garage intensity that is the founding image of the home computer age . When Wozniak , a burly nerd who works on this stuff mostly so that he can feel like one of the guys , takes out his trusty soldering iron to attach transistors to a flat green board , Jobs channels the early paradox of computer culture : that to us the gizmos seemed light , virtual , magical , but to the people who invented them , they were built , diode by diode .
