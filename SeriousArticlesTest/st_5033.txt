" I want you to know that I will not sleep until this person is found . I hope they get you , and I hope they make you pay for a long , long time . You don ' t take from somebody . You didn ' t just take her from me . You took her from my family you took her from all these people . And you don ' t do this to a little baby and put my baby in the trash like she ' s nothing . That ' s not OK , this is not OK . "
