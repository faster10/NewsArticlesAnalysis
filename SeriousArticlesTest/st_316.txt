' This is pretty cool , ' said the German , who represents Golf Club St Leon Rot , part of The European Tour Properties network . ' My first round wasn ' t that great , but since then I have played some really good golf , and for it to turn into a victory this week , well , I can ' t put it into words . It is my first victory , which makes it special , because I have been playing on invites up until now and this just changes my whole schedule , my season , and my goals .
