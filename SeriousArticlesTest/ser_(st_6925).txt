Although the income and excise taxes will remain in force , the real action will be the GST . Not only does it replace state sales taxes , ranging from 5 ? percent to 15 ? percent , it also ends the practice of imposing entry fees on goods coming from outside a state . Truckers can wait five hours or more at state border checkpoints , since they can t enter cities until 10 ? p . m . , the same time state workers start collecting levies on the goods in the trucks . The truckers also must often buy off corrupt officials . The status quo creates artificial barriers that hamper movement of interstate trade and commerce , Rajeev Bakshi , managing director at wholesaler Metro Cash Carry , wrote in an e mail . Replacing state taxes with the GST would greatly enhance our ease of doing business . The GST , by ending tax collection at state borders , would help turn India into one market .
