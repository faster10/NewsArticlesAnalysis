Networking is key ( especially when it ' s with Mariah Carey ) . While working for a production company , the ambitious Moroccan soon found herself in the midst of some of the biggest names in music but it was an introduction to " songbird supreme " Mariah Carey who would lead her to her calling . " One day she turned to me and said , ' You know , you really should direct ' . . . And then I got the opportunity to direct her in this video called " Thank God I Found You ( Remix ) " . . . Directing was extremely natural to me and I realized that Mariah was right this is where I belong . "
