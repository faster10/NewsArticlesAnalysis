For the LePage administration , this controversy is par for the course . Elected in 2010 with just under 38 percent of the vote in a five way contest for the governorship , he won re election in 2014 despite low approval ratings and a pattern of inflammatory ? and sometimes vulgar ? rhetoric ( helped along by a divided opposition ) . Indeed , if LePage has a national profile , it s defined by those comments , from his campaign promise that , As your governor , you re gonna be seeing a lot of me on the front page saying Gov . LePage tells Obama to go to hell , to his attacks on rivals ? Sen . Jackson claims to be for the people , but he s the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline .
