Mets : Reserve infielder Juan Uribe , winner of two World Series rings , hopes to return from a chest cartilage injury that ' s sidelined him since late September . That would give New York more right handed thump on the pine to go with an aging Michael Cuddyer . Johnson was 5 for 13 ( . 385 ) as a Mets pinch hitter during the regular season , including a clutch homer at Washington off Stephen Strasburg . But in the playoffs , Johnson struck out four times in six at bats . Tejada ' s injury prompted New York to call up Triple A shortstop Matt Reynolds , who has never played in the majors . Lefty swinging outfielder Kirk Nieuwenhuis has some pop . He could be replaced on the roster if Uribe is healthy .
