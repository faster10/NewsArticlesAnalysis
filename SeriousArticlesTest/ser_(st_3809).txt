It is possible to bring data to these questions by analyzing a recent online poll of nearly 3 , 400 registered Republicans conducted by NBC News and SurveyMonkey between October 27th and 29th . This unique poll has roughly eight times the number of Republican voters found in traditional election polls with sample sizes of about 1 , 000 respondents . This makes it possible to quantify the nature of support for specific candidates like Trump and Carson because we have enough of their supporters in the poll to draw accurate inferences .
