Well , I am here because like you I know that it is now or never . I m in it to win it because we believe in America , and we love our freedom . And if you love your freedom , thank a vet . Thank a vet , and know that the United States military deserves a commander in chief who loves our country passionately , and will never apologise for this country . A new commander in chief who will never leave our men behind . A new commander in chief , one who will never lie to the families of the fallen . I m in it , because just last week , we re watching our sailors suffer and be humiliated on a world stage at the hands of Iranian captors in violation of international law , because a weak kneed , capitulator in chief has decided that America will lead from behind . And he , who would negotiate deals , kind of with the skills of a community organiser maybe organising a neighbourhood tea , well , he deciding that , No , America would apologise and , as part of the deal , as the enemy sends a message to the rest of the world that they capture and we kowtow , and we apologise , and then , we bend over and say , Thank you , enemy . We are ready for a change . We are ready and our troops deserve the best . A new commander in chief whose track record of success has proven he is the master at the art of the deal . He is one who would know to negotiate .
