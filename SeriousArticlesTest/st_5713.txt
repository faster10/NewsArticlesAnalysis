PRINCE CHARLESHe was a remarkable man , whose wonderful frenetic humour brought a special kind of laughter into people ' s lives . I greatly enjoyed meeting him on several occasions and his irreplaceable contribution to life will be greatly missed . PRESIDENT OBAMARobin Williams was an airman , a doctor , a genie , a nanny , a president , a professor . . . and everything in between . But he was one of a kind . He arrived in our lives as an alien but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit . He made us laugh . He made us cry . BILLY CONNOLLYRobin was both my friend and my hero , a unique talent and a kind and generous man the world will be a much poorer place without him .
