In public , the inquiry heard fleeting references to Litvinenko s UK security minder , known as Martin , who possibly questioned him on his deathbed . It was stated , though not expressly confirmed , that Litvinenko was paid by MI6 . It was possible to divine that he was issued with passports in other names , besides the one he acquired when he became a UK citizen shortly before he died , and that he travelled on MI6 business . How would UK security be harmed if more of this were made public ? As with WikiLeaks , Edward Snowden s revelations , rendition and the like , our security services ( too ? ) often receive the benefit of official doubt . ?
