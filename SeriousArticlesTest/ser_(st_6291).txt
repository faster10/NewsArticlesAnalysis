Some have interpreted the Second Amendment ' s affirmation of the right to bear arms as a barrier to reasonable regulation . Nothing could be further from the truth . The Second Amendment does not pose a barrier to gun regulation , it requires it . As long as there have been guns in America they have been regulated . It would have been impossible to muster the militia to fight the British if we applied today ' s gun rights ideology to the American Revolution . Registration , mandatory inspection of firearms and frequent training were all essential to a well regulated militia . In America today , we have many more guns , but far less government regulation of firearms .
