Much of the responsibility for covering Olsen in week six fell to cornerback Cary Williams , who is no longer a Seahawk , and linebacker Kevin Pierre Louis , whose snaps on defense have been greatly reduced in the latter half of the season . Bobby Wagner was out for the Panthers game , and he has returned to his Pro Bowl linebacker form . DeShawn Shead and Jeremy Lane have solidified their bona fides as legit members of the Legion of Boom , and Olsen and the Panthers should expect a stingier secondary than the one that gave up that game winning big play in week six .
