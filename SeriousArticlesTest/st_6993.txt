While the movie has moments to savor and artistry to spare , these elements don ' t cohere into a satisfying whole . Tran doesn ' t speak Japanese , but in other respects he ' s well suited to Murakami ' s world . A Vietnamese brought up and educated in France , best known for " The Scent of Green Papaya " and " The Vertical Ray of the Sun , " Tran is a cinematic aesthete , very much attuned to melancholy and introspection . " Norwegian Wood " features a tumescent score by Radiohead ' s Jonny Greenwood and stunning cinematography by the Taiwanese Mark Lee Ping bin ( " In the Mood for Love " ) .
