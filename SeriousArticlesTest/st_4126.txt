It should go without saying that no action or intervention ever goes exactly as planned . There will always be setbacks and failures , often with tragic consequences . But while it is easy to find fault with past American interventions overseas , as someone who was born in a totalitarian country I cannot in my heart condemn the effort to defend the lives and freedom of people resisting tyranny , nor mourn the demise of dictators like Saddam Hussein or Moammar Gadhafi . It is absurd to expect peace and democracy to immediately flower in deserts that have known only brutal dictatorship for so long , but this should not be an argument against taking action at all . In fact , it is an argument to act sooner , before too much damage is done .
