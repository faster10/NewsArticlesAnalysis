A Spanish government indictment sought to show that Abu Qatada did go beyond sermons . It alleged that an al Qaeda member , Barakat Yarkas , made more than 20 trips from Spain to Britain between 1995 and 2000 , bringing Abu Qatada funds raised for jihad . When London police raided Abu Qatada ' s home early in 2001 , they found 250 , 000 in cash under his bed . Abu Qatada maintained it was to build a mosque , but some of the money was said to have been marked for the Chechen mujahideen at that point a cause celebre among jihadists .
