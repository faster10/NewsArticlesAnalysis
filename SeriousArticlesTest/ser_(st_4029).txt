Two years ago , I set out to do just that . Mine was a story with some superficial details that had always made for good dinner party conversation : My parents were an interracial couple who met in the mid 1950s , when " miscegenation " was still illegal in most states in America . My father was an undergraduate at Swarthmore College , the only black male student on campus . My mother was a white French professor who cast him in a student play . When they fell in love , they had to meet in secret for a year and a half until he graduated , after which they immediately married .
