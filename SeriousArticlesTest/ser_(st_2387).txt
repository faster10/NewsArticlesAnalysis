Smith , who was watching the Warriors at home instead of playing with the Cavs in Orlando because a 24 hour virus caused him to stay behind , rejoined the team Sunday . Smith said last month he wanted another crack at the Warriors in the Finals , but his motivation in rooting for them this weekend had nothing to do with actually wishing good tidings upon the Warriors and everything to do with sweetening the pot for the Cavs Christmas Day showdown with them in Oakland , California . Not only does Smith want to avenge Cleveland s Finals loss to Golden State with a holiday win , but he wanted the win to simultaneously snap what would have been a 28 0 record for the Warriors had they kept winning .
