Writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have shown a knack for hardboiled black comedy before , notably in " You Kill Me , " and it ' s easy to imagine that the Coen brothers could have fashioned something sharp and funny out of this dismal true story . But even if he ' s obviously imitating " Burn After Reading " ( the Coens ' worst film ) and " Fargo " ( possibly their best ) , putting a satire in Bay ' s hands is rather like presenting the keys of a stolen Lamborghini to a drunken teenager . It ' s a fast ride , but it doesn ' t take you where you want to go .
