Which is odd , because both filmmakers profess to not be sure about what really happened to Teresa Halbach . In an interview with NPR , Ricciardi and Demos describe their process and experience with nuance and passion , and it s regrettable that the nuance , at least , does not make it through to Making a ? Murderer . The filmmakers spent two years living in Wisconsin and working with the Averys , and describe the film as an attempt to reveal not the truth of the case but the flaws in the process of the justice system . Personally , I find it difficult to read the miniseries as being about anything except exculpating Avery and Dassey ? the final episode ends with Avery narrating how he is going to continue fighting for his freedom and Dassey reading an open letter protesting his innocence . And yet Pajiba , via Reddit , has already uncovered a whole trove of evidence that , if even partly corroborated , casts quite a bit of doubt on the Making a ? Murderer narrative of the events of Oct . 31 , 2005 . What really matters , probably , is whether or not the courts process is reliable , but Making a ? Murderer focuses elsewhere , spending a great deal of time interviewing family members and playing up both Avery s and Dassey s gentle heartedness . It ultimately weakens the documentary s reliability , even if in the short term , it s brought in more signatories onto the Change . org petitions .
