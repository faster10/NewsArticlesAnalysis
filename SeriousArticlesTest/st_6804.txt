I think people are getting a little carried away with the Cam Newton narrative . The numbers say he ' s the same guy he ' s been throughout his career with a lot more touchdowns . Completion percentage , ( 59 . 7 to 59 . 5 ) , yards per attempt ( 7 . 7 to 7 . 5 ) , yards per game ( 239 . 8 to 234 . 1 ) , rushing yards per attempt ( 4 . 8 ) and rushing yards per game ( 39 . 8 ) all mirror his career numbers . He ' s got 17 touchdowns and one interception against the Giants , Redskins and Saints and 18 touchdowns and nine interceptions against everybody else . Those aren ' t bad numbers they ' re just pretty much the same ones he ' s posted throughout his career . The notion that he is somehow " proving " something by being in the Super Bowl is silly when you consider that the guy he is facing is " proving " that a quarterback who at times looks physically incapable of throwing the ball can still make it to the Super Bowl if he is surrounded by the right supporting cast .
