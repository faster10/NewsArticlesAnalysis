Yet Rickman was a rangy actor who , wary of repeating himself , proved equally able in comedic roles , such as in the Star Trek spoof Galaxy Quest ( 1999 ) and as the voice of a hilariously depressed robot in The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy ( 2005 ) . In the romantic comedy epic Love Actually ( 2003 ) , he nimbly stepped aside to let colleagues Emma Thompson and Rowan Atkinson dominate their scenes , though even in a small role , he proved he could bring great pathos to the portrayal of an ordinary husband and dad who is temporarily beguiled by the possibility of an office fling . When he says , I am so in the wrong . A classic fool , he provides a kind of hangover moment of rue . Rickman doesn t grab you by the collar , he simply lets you into his cloud of regret . It s just one beautifully modulated second in a richly creative career .
