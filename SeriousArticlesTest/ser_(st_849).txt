Said britishpal : " I worked in hotels for a number of years , and time after time the thing that got staff all panicked and on edge were when American tourists were expected . Most of the rude behaviors described in this article could just as easily be attributed to American tourists demanding services that aren ' t offered , expecting meal times to be extended far beyond reasonable hours , the expectation that their cash flashing would give them extra entitlements , etc . And to be fair , I ' ve heard British tourists are just as bad in European countries , even outside of World Cup events . "
