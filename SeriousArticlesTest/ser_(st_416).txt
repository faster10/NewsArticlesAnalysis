Scepticism seems justified about the likely achievements of us bombing targets in Syria . Over the past 17 months , the US Air Force has flown 57 , 000 sorties over Iraq and Syria , carrying out 8 , 300 strikes in the course of its Operation Inherent Resolve . It seems fanciful to suppose that Britain s tiny Tornado element of a handful of planes , which has so far flown 1 , 600 sorties and conducted 360 strikes , can add much . Washington badly wants us in Syria , but for political and not military reasons .
