In contrast , efforts in public health and research have gone better . The Gates Foundation s programs in Africa have helped to reduce measles by 90 percent in the past 15 years , among other successes . In realms where a functioning infrastructure already exists ? such as medicine ? an influx of cash can bolster existing projects and help organizations see them through more quickly and effectively . Where the infrastructure is poor , as in education , outside injections of cash meant to fundamentally alter the existing ways of doing things simply don t help . This goes to show that money and philanthropy work best in a supporting role rather than a fundamental structuring one . For billionaires to take on the latter , they d have to become dictators , and unless you re a Donald Trump supporter , that s probably not an appealing idea .
