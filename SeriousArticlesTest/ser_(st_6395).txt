The story could be called something of a distant cousin to Harry Potter , but Gaiman ' s novel is more about myth than magic . His narrator says at one point , " I liked myths . They weren ' t adult stories and they weren ' t children ' s stories . They were better than that . They just were . " While that succinctly sums up the book , even more so , this is a rich story beautifully told about memory , innocence and a longing for the way things were when we were younger .
