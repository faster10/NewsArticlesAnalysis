This past week my heart ached due to the mistreatment of our fellow black brothers and sisters at the University of Missouri and the horrific stories of racism and inequality that have plagued their college experiences . After hearing the tragic tales of white supremacy rallies in the heart of Mizzou ' s campus , screaming white men chasing black girls in pick up trucks , as well as death threats , I was sad for those students , I was sad for their family members , I was sad for my country , but above all , I was sad for you .
