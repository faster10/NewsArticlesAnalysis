" I feel like I ' m dreaming right now because I ' m feeling like ' why me ? ' " said Richardson , who played six seasons with the Warriors and only made the playoffs once , with the " We Believe " team of 2006 07 . " I didn ' t feel like I did anything special as far as winning a championship or being an All Star or winning a lot of games here . So to be back in front of this fan base and be honored in front of them , I don ' t know if I ' m really up right now . I think this is a dream . "
