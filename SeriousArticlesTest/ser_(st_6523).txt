Weinfuss : If the Cardinals can t run against the Panthers , they ll start throwing the ball . A lot . Against Green Bay , Arizona threw 14 times in the first half , compared to 24 times in the first half . Coach Bruce Arians said the Cardinals have been getting their butts kicked up front in the run game . If the running game gets stuffed early , I wouldn t be surprised if Arizona just abandons it and goes for the win in the air . They have the weapons . Palmer had the best season of his career , and wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald has been revitalized .
