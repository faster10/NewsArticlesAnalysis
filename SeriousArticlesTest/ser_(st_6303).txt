Dirk Nowitzki was held to just 11 points in the loss , but it was encouraging to see him log 34 minutes . I still expect his minutes to decline at some point , so you may want to try and sell high since he is currently returning top 20 value . Deron Williams continued to impress with 20 points , six assists , six boards , two treys and a steal , but it s really all about staying healthy with him . Head coach Rick Carlisle hinted on Sunday that Chandler Parsons playing time would gradually increase , and he played a season high 24 minutes with 12 points , three boards and two treys . It will probably be safe to start him in a couple weeks if he approaches 30 minutes per game . Wes Matthews added 18 points and Zaza Pachulia double doubled with 12 points , 10 boards , six assists and three blocks . Wait , what ?
