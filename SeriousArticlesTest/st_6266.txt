I feel sorry for myself , but I m not expecting others to feel sorry for me . I work hard to be good and I came up short . I let a lot of people down ? the guys on our team , the fans . All I can do is stand up here and take it all on me . I feel like I lost the game for the team and that I should have been out there kicking that tying extra point and helping us get into overtime .
