I don ' t think that anymore , having read in " Space Chronicles " ( Norton ) , a recently published collection of articles by astrophysicist and Hayden Planetarium director Neil deGrasse Tyson , that only 4 of the U . S . budget during the 1960s went toward meeting President John F . Kennedy ' s goal of landing men on the moon before 1970 .

S . citizen ' s tax bill . "
