It ' s also not typical to look to defensive and return game scores as contributing to a slowed down offensive output . If you ' re getting a disproportionate number of points when you don ' t actually have the ball and that suddenly stops , that ' ll cause your scoring average to precipitously drop as well . But that hasn ' t been the case with Green Bay , either . The Packers have only one defensive or return touchdown this season , a Quinten Rollins pick six during their Week 5 win over the Rams .
