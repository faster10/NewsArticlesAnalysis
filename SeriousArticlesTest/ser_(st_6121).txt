The Times columnist and global warming critic Matt Ridley ( the George Monbiot of the right ? clever and well informed , sceptical , all in the opposite direction ) , explains here ( paywall ) that the Leave . EU campaign , funded by the mouthy City money man Aaron Banks , with Nigel Farage on board , is the core no vote , anti immigrant camp . The more mainstream Vote Leave , run by Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott , will probably be designated the official no voice and concentrate on assuring the wavering third of voters , the ones who will decide the outcome , that their jobs and their kids prospects will be safer . Caine is their kind of target voter .
