There is a more important change on the battlefield further west , where Russia is setting up a new air base in preparation for a Syrian army attack on Isis ? at Palmyra . Russian planes , which have hitherto operated out of Hmeimim base on the Mediterranean coast , will now also use Shaayrat base in Homs province , where new runways are being built . The Syrian regime forces are about 3km ? from Palmyra and are advancing from the south and west , Rami Abdel Rahman , who heads the pro opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , has said . Syrian troops have already reached al Qaryatayn , a largely Christian town captured by Isis ? in the summer . Russian planes launched 40 air strikes around the town in a 24 hour period . There are also reports of Russia sending heavy artillery to Syria . ?
