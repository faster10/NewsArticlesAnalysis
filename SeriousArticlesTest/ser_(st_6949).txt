The tragedy of 9 11 hastened the end of any kind of special treatment . Boarding became a cattle call complete with prodding with a stick where you had to basically undress before you could get on the plane , take off shoes , coats , sweaters , get " wanded , " step out of the line for frisking , and other debasements too horrible to mention . Soon they will be swabbing your hands for explosives . Really ! I know one woman whose underwire bra had security stumped . ( I have to check a bag just for the hair products for my frizzy hair they don ' t come in less than three ounces . )
