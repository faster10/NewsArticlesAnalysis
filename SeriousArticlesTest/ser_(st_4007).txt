China has new rules in place so that if they have a big drop ? they have what s called a circuit breaker and the market stops trading ? takes a breather , so that people can get their thoughts together go back in with , hopefully , a level head , Miller said . That happened at a 5 percent drop ? they took a 15 minute break , and when they opened up , the market just continued to fall further . So after it fell 7 percent they just closed the stock market in China .
