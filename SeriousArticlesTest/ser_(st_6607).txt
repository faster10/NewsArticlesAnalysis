Another misconception is that the vast majority of migrant workers currently out of status sneak across our southern border in the middle of the night . Actually , almost half enter the U . S . with a valid tourist or work visa and overstay their allotted time . Many go to school , find a job , get married and start a family . And some even join the Marine Corps , like Lance Cpl . Jose Gutierrez , who was the first combat veteran to die in the Iraq War . While he was granted American citizenship posthumously , there are another 38 , 000 non citizens in uniform , including undocumented immigrants , defending our country .
