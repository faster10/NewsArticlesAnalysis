Marco Rubio : After two earlier solid performances , Rubio comes into tonight ' s debate as arguably the GOP establishment ' s new favorite and after some rough news coverage about his day job as a U . S . senator . In fact , the Florida Sun Sentinel called on him to resign if he longer is casting votes . " If you hate your job , senator , follow the honorable lead of House Speaker John Boehner and resign it . Let us elect someone who wants to be there and earn an honest dollar for an honest day ' s work . " Wow . Don ' t be surprised if some GOP candidates not named Jeb ( John Kasich , Chris Christie ) go after Rubio here .
