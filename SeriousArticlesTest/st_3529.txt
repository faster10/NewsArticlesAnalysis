Winning margin Alabama 1 6 ( 50 , 16 5 ) and 7 12 ( 100 , 15 4 ) : This is a double play and a bit of a hedge for me . I ' m on record with Alabama 7 as my pick , but I don ' t think it ' s going to be a total domination by the Tide . If it lands 7 12 , I ' d win ( or at worst push ) my 7 play and also get an extra 375 .
