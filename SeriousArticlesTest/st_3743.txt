I ' m the demographic Romney needs to win over : Young , female , undecided . My conservative side wants to like Mitt , but he ' s not making it easy . Don ' t tell me you ' re out of work and understand unemployment when you are worth 200 million and post grads like me can ' t find a job . Don ' t say , " Planned Parenthood , we ' re going to get rid of that , " like you ' re throwing out an old sofa . Planned Parenthood is not a " that . "
