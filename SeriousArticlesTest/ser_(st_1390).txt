After missing Game 3 , Bryant was back for Game 4 , but it was unclear how the ankle would respond . In a game that went to overtime and saw Shaquille O Neal foul out with the Lakers clinging to a one point lead with 2 : 21 left , Bryant hit tough jumpers on consecutive possessions and tipped in a missed shot from Brian Shaw with five seconds left that ended up sealing the victory and giving the Lakers a commanding 3 1 series lead they would never relinquish .
