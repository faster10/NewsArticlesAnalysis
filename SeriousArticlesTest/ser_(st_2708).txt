The only thing Santa Clara has going for them if they think Hue is their 3 guy ( Sean Payton was their 1 , Gase was their 2 ) is Hue is a Bay Area guy . But does Hue want the Whiners ? The roster is terrible , the ownership is a joke , the GM should have been fired , they have no QB and at 7 in the draft they won t get either of the top 2 QBs . If by some miracle Ballke hits on 1 2 his 12 picks , the players won t develop till Hue is gone . I think Hue is better served with a better organization than Santa Clara . He can use them to push up dollar amount from other teams . Hey maybe Tomsula can come back and coach , they re paying him 10 . 5 mill anyway when he s not there .
