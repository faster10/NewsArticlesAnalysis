FILE In this January 2015 file photo , attendees sit in the self driving Mercedes Benz F 015 concept car at the Mercedes Benz booth at the International CES , in Las Vegas . Everything we buy or use these days has the potential to be smarter . Self driving cars can transform our commuting hours into productive time . Sensor laden socks can let us know how to jog with fewer injuries . The 2016 International CES will have a panoply of vendors showing off such connected devices , from smart umbrellas that will notify you if youve left them behind , to navigation devices that project directions on car windshields so you dont have to take your eyes off the road .
