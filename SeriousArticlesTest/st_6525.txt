I ll give you that Palmer and his receivers have been spectacular . But the Panthers have faced and beaten Aaron Rodgers , Russell Wilson , Andrew Luck ( when he was healthy ) , Drew Brees and Eli Manning this year . They ve given up some yards , sure , but they ' ve survived . The difference is the secondary isn t as strong with cornerback Robert McClain and nickel corner Cortland Finnegan , who weren t on the roster most of the season , starting for injured players . Regardless , this should be a classic .
