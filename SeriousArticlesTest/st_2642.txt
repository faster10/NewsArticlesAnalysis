Of his work as guardian of the reptiles , Booms says , " My family and friends ? Some of them think it ' s awesome . . . . Some of them ask me if I really touch the lizards and some think I ' m crazy when they hear about the crocodiles . But the truth of the matter is that they don ' t understand , and I know that . ' Cause if they were here like me , they would understand . We are at one with nature . "
