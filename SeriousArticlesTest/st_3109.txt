The " Plan of Action " calls for tapping this wellspring of American idealism to meet pressing national challenges . High on the list is the nation ' s dropout crisis . Each year , more than a million students fail to graduate with their senior class . Dropouts are eight times more likely to be incarcerated , and three times more likely to be unhealthy or unemployed . Absent effective intervention , the 10 million students who are projected to drop out in the next decade will cost the nation 3 trillion in lost wages , health care expenses , welfare benefits and incarceration costs .
