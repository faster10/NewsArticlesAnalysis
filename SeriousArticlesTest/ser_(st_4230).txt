I decided that what I had to do in order to get different angles on this material you had to have people in different vocations . So the lead in " Spies of the Balkans " is a cop , and he sees things like a policeman sees things . Where as in " Mission to Paris , " you have a Hollywood movie actor , an migr , and he sees things a completely different way . In an earlier book , you had the French military attach in Warsaw , and he had his own responsibilities and obligations , and he saw life from that perspective . If you ' re a writer like I am , it ' s the best thing because it forces you to work .
