The MMR ( measles , mumps and rubella ) vaccine protects against rubella infection . It is still not part of India s universal immunisation programme , though it is included in several state run programmes and is now recommended routinely for children . Since many women over the age of 20 in India may not have got the MMR vaccine , consider getting tested for rubella immunity . If you re not immune , get vaccinated at least one month before conceiving . The vaccine contains a live virus that may cause rubella infection in the baby , so pregnant women must not get vaccinated .
