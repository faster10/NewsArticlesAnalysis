CLINTON : Well you know , Rachel , I think I may not have done the job I should in explaining my record . You know , I did ? when I left the secretary of State s office , like so many former officials , military leaders , journalists , others , I did go on the speaking circuit . I spoke to heart doctors , I spoke to the American Camping Association , I spoke to auto dealers , and yes , I spoke to firms on Wall Street . They wanted me to talk about the world , what my experience had been as secretary of State .
