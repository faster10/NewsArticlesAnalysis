Where were the protesters when Tyshawn Lee , 9 , was killed by gang members ? But should a policeman be quick to shoot anyone carrying a weapon , now that deserves a protest . Closing down main streets and disrupting people ' s freedom of movement doesn ' t help deliver the message . It just makes everyone angry . Nobody should shoot anybody 16 times like police officer Jason Van Dyke did to Laquan McDonald , but the protests against one policeman for a shooting when people are killed every day in Chicago is ridiculous .
