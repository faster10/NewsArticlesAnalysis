A country that refuses to confront its past is a country in denial . " 12 Years A Slave " startles the viewer like a slap in the face , and the film is even more astonishing since it is the work of Steve McQueen , a black British director who said during a press conference at the Toronto International Film Festival that he was particularly interested in the subject because it " is about how to survive an unfortunate situation .

If that starts a conversation , wonderful . "
