So there has been outrage from people who feel that the world has " selective sympathy " for Paris and not for victims of terrorist attacks if those victims are Arab or " non white . " This is apparent on Facebook where a filter was created of the French Flag for users to put over their profile pictures . Where is the filter for Lebanon ? Or any of the other countries that people have suffered from terrorism ? I agree with this because it is glaringly true . But I do not feel that sense of " outrage " per se . Part of the reason is that I am feeling a numbness to the double standards against Muslims . Part of the reason too is that deep down , I do not need human sympathy for Muslims as I truly believe God keeps track of all of the injustices of the world . But it does need to be called out because these disparities only provoke further division and provoke bigotry which can lead to violence against Muslims .
