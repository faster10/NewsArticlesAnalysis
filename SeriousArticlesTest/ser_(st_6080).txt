" I don ' t know , " James said . " What do you guys want me to do , turn my brain off because I have a huge basketball IQ ? If that ' s what they want me to do , I ' m not going to do it because I ' ve got so much to give to the game . There ' s no difference for me telling my teammates or telling guys how to get better with their game . If I feel I got something that will help our team , ultimately , I like to give it . It helped me get two titles . So , but I think it does suck that people want to throw my name in dirt for no particular reason , because of speculation or whatever the case may be . But you can ' t worry about it too much . I got 14 guys here . I got a fan base here and a fan base all over the world that loves what I do , and they respect what I do , and I can ' t worry about a select group of people that wants to use their negative energy to take away my positive energy . I can ' t allow that to happen . "
