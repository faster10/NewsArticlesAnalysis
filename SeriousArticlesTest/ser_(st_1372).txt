Just look at Disney ' s line up one film after another is about a helpless princess needing a man to get her out of a nasty situation , ending with the two falling in love and the woman giving up whatever life she had before . Most of these movies teach boys that all girls want is a handsome man with lots of money . Not really an inspiring message . But " Toy Story " isn ' t based on archaic fairy tales it ' s an original idea . While not fully politically correct , it ' s a stride in the right direction .
