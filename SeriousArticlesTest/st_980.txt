The big event while I was there was El Dia de los Muertos the Mexican Day of the Dead . I ' d never had such a good time in a graveyard . The place was packed with makeshift altars , temporary stages and food stalls for an event that mocks death and celebrates ancestors . Mexican music boomed , Aztec dancers shook their feathers and people sat on gravestones painting each other ' s faces to look like grinning skulls . Johnny Depp recently turned up at Hollywood Forever for a Johnny Ramone Tribute ( both Johnny and Dee Dee of the Ramones are cemetery residents ) .
