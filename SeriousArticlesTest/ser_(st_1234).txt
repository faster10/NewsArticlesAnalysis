Whether or not we agree that anything at all in modern society needs to be changed , we must at least come to understand that the occupiers are not just another political movement , nor are they simply lazy kids looking for an excuse not to work . Rather , they see the futility of attempting to use the tools of a competitive , winner takes all society for purposes that might better be served through the tools of mutual aid . This is not a game that someone wins , but rather a form of play that is successful the more people get to play , and the longer the game is kept going .
