' Remember a few years ago when Congress declared that the sauce on a slice of pizza should count as a vegetable in school lunches ? ' she wrote in The New York Times . ' You don ' t have to be a nutritionist to know that this doesn ' t make much sense . Yet we ' re seeing the same thing happening again with these new efforts to lower nutrition standards in our schools . ' Mrs Obama lobbied largely behind the scenes four years ago for the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act of 2010 , which requires more fruit , vegetables and whole grains in school meals , along with less sodium , sugar and fat . It was a major achievement , the first update to school lunch rules in decades designed to make school meals more nutritious . The School Nutrition Association , an industry backed group that represents school cafeteria workers and originally supported the standards , has now turned against them . The association says it fully supports getting kids to eat healthier but says many districts are losing money because students aren ' t buying the healthier lunches . More than 1 million fewer students eat lunch at school each day since the first round of standards went into effect in 2012 , following decades of steadily increasing participation , said Diane Pratt Heavner , a spokeswoman for the association . A second round of rules , including standards for school breakfasts , took effect July 1 . ' How can we call these standards a success when they are driving students away from the program ? ' she said .
