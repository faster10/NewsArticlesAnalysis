CHRISTIE COMPARES RUBIO TO OBAMA : New Jersey Gov . ? Chris Christie ? says ? Marco Rubio ? doesn ' t have the experience to be president , and that he won t drop out of the race even if the Florida senator beats him in New Hampshire , ABC s VERONICA STRACQUALURSI notes . " He just doesn ' t have any experience . All he has is experience of being a legislator , " Christie said on " Good Morning America " today . We ' ve tried that as a party and as a country and it doesn ' t work . " Christie ' s argument centers around Rubio s age ? 44 ? and his belief that Rubio is not a strong enough candidate to take on ? Hillary Clinton ? in the general election if she wins the Democratic nomination . " We need to make sure we nominate someone who not only can beat Hillary Clinton but also can manage the government and get it back on the right track once they ' re elected president of the United States , " Christie , 53 , argued . " No need to take those chances on someone who ' s never managed anything larger than a 30 person Senate staff . " http : abcn . ws 1P8F9DZ
