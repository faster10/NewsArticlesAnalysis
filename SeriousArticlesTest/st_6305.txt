Kenneth Faried sat this one out for the Nuggets due to an ankle sprain , so Darrell Arthur got the start and exploded for 21 points , eight boards and one 3 pointer . To be clear , that will probably never happen again in his life . Besides , Faried could return as soon as Tuesday s game vs . the Clippers . Nikola Jokic started again and double doubled with 11 points , 11 boards , two assists , two steals and one block in 27 minutes . The Nuggets have every reason to give Jokic minutes , so I love his outlook going forward . Jusuf Nurkic s ( knee ) return will make things interesting , though . Emmanuel Mudiay had 17 points with eight assists , but he struggled with efficiency once again by turning the ball over three times and shooting 6 of 21 from the field . Will Barton , another candidate for the Sixth Man of the year Award , stayed hot with 19 points , six boards , three assists , one steal and one block . ? The Thrill is a must start player and is has been a top a top 30 asset .
