" We hid , " the report quotes former U . S . Postal Service team member Tyler Hamilton . " At the time , the whereabouts programs of drug testing agencies were not very robust . " The sport ' s international governing body , the UCI , " did not even have an out of competition testing program . If a tester did show up , you typically would not get a missed test even if you decided not to answer the door . In any case , there was no penalty until you had missed three tests . So , avoiding testing was just one more way we gamed the system . "
