The Supreme Court has refused to offer a broad rule on religious monuments , taking a more case specific approach . Ten Commandments displays in public schools were banned in 1980 . But the justices in 2005 allowed a 57 year old Ten Commandments granite monument to stay on the Texas statehouse grounds , where it stands amid a series of nonreligious symbols . A similar display in Kentucky was ordered removed after the high court concluded it violated the separation between church and state . Unlike Utah , those cases involved efforts to remove the monuments .
