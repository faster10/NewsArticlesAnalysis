The support we received was the most comforting . Less than four days after the earthquake , Captain Burrell , the President of the Jamaican Football Federation , arrived in two helicopters sent by the Presidents of FIFA CONCACAF . We accompanied him on a small tour of the town and met leaders in the stadium and on the ruins of our headquarters . The very emotional report that he wrote touched the world football family even more on the hugeness of the tragedy . The president of the Dominican Football Federation sent colleagues to check on us and find out about our needs . He also sent me some meds that were very precious . President Blatter and a lot of his colleagues called me and assured me that we were not alone .
