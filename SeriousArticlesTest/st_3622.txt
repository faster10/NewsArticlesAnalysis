That does not mean that Reagan or Goldwater were racist just as it is mistake to label the Tea Partiers of today racist but that heroic fight wasn ' t their primary or even secondary concern , nor was it that of their conservative constituents . Not coincidentally , the former Confederate states of the South realigned in 1964 , with traditionally Democratic Mississippi voting 87 percent for the Republican Party .
