Next up is Carly Fiorina , a female CEO in a world where just one in eight Fortune 500 CEOs is a woman . Fiorina has broken new ground for women , serving as a role model for young girls who want to achieve success , manage large companies , and maybe even run for President . Her story is a great example of the American Dream . Instead of standing up for Fiorina who like Clinton , has broken glass ceilings to reach where she is today ( and must deal with sexist antics from Donald Trump ) , Clinton has repeatedly put her down . She laughed when a supporter recently told her that he wanted to " strangle " Fiorina every time he saw her on TV .
