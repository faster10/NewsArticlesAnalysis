Pakistan s attempts to engage Saudi Arabia and Iran to defuse tensions at the highest level are obviously very welcome because of the imperatives that Pakistan has , given its own large Shia population . An all out war between Iran and Saudi Arabia holds up a terrible prospect for sectarian violence in Pakistan , which we just cannot afford . Yet one is less than sanguine about the chances of the success of such a venture . This is because Saudi Arabia and Iran are at this time already engaged in a multi pronged economic , social and religious war with each other . This is a new kind of war , a war of attrition , the weapons of which are oil and economics as well as sectarian and ideological provocations .
