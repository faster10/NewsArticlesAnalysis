When I first heard about the Costa Concordia , I thought back to the guidance that Alexander Hamilton provided in 1790 to the captains of the first 10 cutters of the U . S . Revenue Marine the precursor to the Coast Guard . Hamilton advised that they had been " selected with careful attention to character " and told them to " Refrain from haughtiness , rudeness , or insult " and to " Endeavor to overcome difficulties by a cool and temperate perseverance in your duty . " He declared that a captain ' s demeanor and behavior must " be marked with prudence , moderation , and good temper . Upon these qualities must depend the success , usefulness and . . . continuance of the establishment in which they are included . "
