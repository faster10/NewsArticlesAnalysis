It used to baffle me when I first started playing that you ' d have Chelsea fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the Chelsea ' s team . And if you spoke to them or confronted them about it , they would be like , " Oh yeah , but we know them . . . they are , you know , they are fine . " And it ' s like , well how do you pick the bones out of that ? Because there is just no logic .
