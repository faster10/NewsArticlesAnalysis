South Korean students hold signs during a rally demanding full compensation and apology for wartime sex slaves from Japanese government near the Japanese Embassy in Seoul , South Korea , Wednesday , Oct . 28 , 2015 . Only days before leaders from South Korea , Japan and China are to gather in Seoul this weekend , the event has still not yet been formally settled , with the South Korean and Japanese foreign ministries publicly dodging questions even as diplomats leak barbed tidbits to reporters behind the scenes . The problem this week , as is often the case in Northeast Asia , appears to be history , and specifically the inability of Seoul and Tokyo to settle disputes stemming from Japan s brutal colonial rule of Korea in the early 20th century . The letters read Apology and Live long and stay healthy . ( Lee Jin man Associated Press )
