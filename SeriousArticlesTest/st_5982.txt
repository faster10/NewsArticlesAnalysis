Fitzpatrick never had won more than six starts in a season , so he went into Sunday seeking to venture into uncharted territory . It didn ' t look good midway through the fourth quarter with the Jets trailing 20 10 . Then Giants coach Tom Coughlin passed up a field goal attempt ( bad choice ) , Rontez Miles made an interception at the 3 yard line and Fitzpatrick went to work . Over the next three possessions , Fitzpatrick completed 18 of 27 passes for 194 yards and a touchdown , dissecting the NFL ' s worst pass defense .
