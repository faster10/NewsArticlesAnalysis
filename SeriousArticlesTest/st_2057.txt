Continuing south through rural Arkansas and Tennessee , the route earns its legendary moniker ' the Blues Highway ' as it follows the sinuous course of the mighty Mississippi through its namesake state ' s Delta Region . Crossing into Louisiana , US 61 ends fittingly at the blues clubs and other myriad pleasures of New Orleans .
