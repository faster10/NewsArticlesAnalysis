Hurd : As we like to say , Rick spent a little time in " Crazytown " last season . But he ' s always someone who will step up if necessary . This season , he ' s in a very different place . He realizes that perhaps the most important role in the zombie apocalypse is that of a good father . He needs to raise Carl not to be a trigger happy child soldier , and his baby , Judith , he ' s taking that responsibility very seriously .
