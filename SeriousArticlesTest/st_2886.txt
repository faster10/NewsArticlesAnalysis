The 66 year old said : ' It is no wonder the Chart Show is a complete failure because it has not accomplished what it was set out to be . It is the news of popular music and , if it is to have any integrity , it should be an objective show . You wouldn ' t expect Huw Edwards to give his opinion on the news he is reading or to suddenly say ' Isn ' t Hillary Clinton fit ? ' The Chart Show has become an extension of its presenter ' s personality rather than an objective programme . '
