Mr Sununu predicted serious candidates will start understanding that in order to compete with the free media that Carson and Trump have been getting because they are really entertainment at this point , the serious candidates are going to start pumping up their advertising , talking about their background , talking about their positions , and eventually , I believe , the Republican electorate is going to understand that this is an election that is important , that we can t make a mistake , that we ve got to nominate someone and if we do nominate someone that has the capacity to be president , they will go ahead and beat Hillary Clinton .
