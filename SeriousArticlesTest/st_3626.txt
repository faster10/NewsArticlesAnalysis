Rihanna albums weren t always consistent bodies of work , either . They were building toward one hell of a greatest hits collection , but they were often hodgepodges of tracks from top hitmakers for whom Rihanna was just a vessel . The songwriter Sia , who wrote Rihanna s global hit Diamonds , says that Rihanna stuck so closely to the track s original demo that at first Sia thought it was her voice , not Rihanna s , on the final product . Yet Anti , as its title suggests , flips the order of Rihanna s universe . It bets on the value of cohesive albums in a pop universe dominated by singles and wisely lets its star ? her talents , her whims , her personality ? become the center of gravity . In throwing out everything you think you know about a Rihanna album , Rihanna shows you why you d want one in the first place .
