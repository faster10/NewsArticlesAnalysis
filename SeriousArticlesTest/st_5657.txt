First , it was the military , now it ' s pro sports being forced to realize that there is no " us " and " them " when it comes to sexuality . We are all on the same team . I ' ll bet that Jason Collins will be the first in a string of professional athletes to openly acknowledge their homosexuality . You can also think of him as the next in a chain of civil rights pioneers . And I ' ll bet you ' ll start seeing them play a bit better . We ' re all at our best when we don ' t have to hide who we are , when we can bring it all to the court .
