The situation has changed markedly since Secretary Carter wrote those words . North Korea , for instance , had yet to test a nuclear weapon at the time that op ed was written . The fact that the Kim dynasty has claimed to have done so on four separate occasions since then is a testament to how dangerous and risky such a preventive attack would be . Pyongyang could respond in any number of ways , from simply speeding up the reconstruction of its destroyed or degraded nuclear program to massing hundreds of thousands of troops along the DMZ line or lobbing conventional armaments towards Seoul . No one in Washington is seriously considering a military option to the latest nuclear test , and for good reason : unless the United States is willing to sacrifice tens of thousands of South Korean and American casualties , a campaign of surgical airstrikes would do more to destabilize a region that is already full of historical animosities .
