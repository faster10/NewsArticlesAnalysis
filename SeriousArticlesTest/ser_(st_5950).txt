Ranieri added : I gave Jamie a signed shirt , with the date , to mark a great achievement . I signed it first , then all the players too . I thought we closed our defence very well and tried to counterattack when we could , and I was not surprised when United came with three centre ? backs to try and stop Jamie scoring . I have been waiting for someone to do that , and I must admit I thought about Louis when Jamie scored the opening goal . It was good for us and great for Jamie but I thought at the time that maybe Louis would be very angry .
