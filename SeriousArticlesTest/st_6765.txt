Are you ready to share in that again , Iowa ? Because that s what s going to let you make America great again . He s going to be able to empower you to look out for one another again instead of relying on bankrupt government to supposedly be looking out for you . No , and I think you re ready for that . And Iowa , I believe too that you re ready to see that our vets are treated better than illegal immigrants are treated in this country . You re ready for the tax reform he talks about to open up main street again . And you re ready to stop the race baiting and the division based on colour , zip code , to unify around the right issues . The issues important to me , or I wouldn t be endorsing him . Pro life , pro Second Amendment , strict constitutionality . Those things that are unifying values and their time tested truths involved . These are unifying values from big cities to tiny towns , from big mountain states and the Big Apple , to the big , beautiful heartland that is in between .
