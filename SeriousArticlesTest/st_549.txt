In 2011 , Governor Snyder signed a bill , unique to Michigan , that gives him the authority to appoint " emergency managers " accountable only to him to take over " financially distressed " governments and school districts . These managers the city of Flint had four of them in four years have near dictatorial powers . The decision to cut costs by switching the city to corrosive water from the Flint River was made by an emergency manager . Even after the residents of Flint became concerned about their water , they and their locally elected leaders were powerless to do anything about it . All the power was in the hands of the Snyder administration , which clearly could not have cared less .
