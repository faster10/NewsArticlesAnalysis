Ask Manning about that . Mike Vanderjagt was in position to tie a divisional round game at the end of the 2005 season against the Pittsburgh Steelers , and he missed wide right . Had the Colts won that , I ' d bet heavily they ' d have gone on to beat the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks and Manning would have two rings right now . And it ' s also worth noting that Vanderjagt ripping Manning after the 2002 season for not being fiery enough ( which led to Manning ' s famous " idiot kicker " interview at the Pro Bowl ) and that probably helped shape the narrative about Manning ' s career in a small way .
