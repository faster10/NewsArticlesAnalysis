North of Lincoln Road , on the Biscayne Bay side of Miami Beach is Joe Allen restaurant ( 1787 Purdy Ave . ) , a bastion of good food and service that a crowd of mostly local clientele has kept going for nearly a decade . The restaurant has locations in other cities , but walking into the low key Miami Beach dining room you would swear you stumbled onto a well kept secret . Joe Allen ' s serves really fresh comfort food : steaming plates of mussels in an Asian broth , homemade pastas , great burgers and a killer meatloaf . This is not the place for celebrity sightings and the latest trendy food , but you will eat well and not break the bank .
