We wanted to know who the UX were . His answer was suitably cryptic . " The UX is a collective of people who pursue the same aim with a range of skills . It is anyone and everyone . There are no characteristics in terms of age , sex , social or cultural background the only characteristic is to live relatively close to the area where the projects are carried out , in Paris . All the rules of the UX have to do with feasibility the practical aspect of the execution of the projects . "
