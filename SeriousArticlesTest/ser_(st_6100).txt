Seemed like a lot of missed tackles , Kerrigan said . Disappointing , because I think our coaches did a good job to put us in positions to make plays , we just didn t make them . Not to sound like former Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green , but they were who they thought we would be . They ran the ball . Stewart , when something wasn t there up the middle , he would bounce it outside , just like we saw on film , and he did that .
