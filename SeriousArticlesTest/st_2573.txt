I can t have been the only one who had an uncharitable thought on hearing the news that Rafael Nadal had been knocked out in the first round of the Australian Open . Was it fixed ? Did Rafa throw the match ? Of course it wasn t fixed : the ultra competitive Spaniard would be horrified at the very suggestion . And that aside , this is a Grand Slam event ? no one would throw a match of such importance , and certainly not when tennis is under so much scrutiny . So we can assume that Fernando Verdasco s victory over Nadal ? a man who had beaten him 14 times in their previous 16 encounters ? was exactly as presented : a surprise result .
