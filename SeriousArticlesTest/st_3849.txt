Hastings , a young reporter whose work has been published in a variety of reputable publications , including the Washington Post , the L . A . Times , GQ and Foreign Policy , was a Newsweek correspondent in Iraq from 2005 to 2007 . His girlfriend , Andi Parhamovich , another young journalist , followed him there she was killed in a Sunni militia ambush in January 2007 . His memoir of the experience , " I Lost My Love in Baghdad : A Modern War Story " , was published in 2008 , and quickly panned by New Yorker staff writer George Packer in a review in the New York Times . It was " really two books " that failed to reconcile the war story and their romance . It had an " embarrassing title . " It carried a " whiff of exploitation , " and it suffered from " literary shortcomings . "
