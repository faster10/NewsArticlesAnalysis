Morgenstern : I like that " once upon a time " quality , where the telling of a tale has an elevated sense of story . There ' s a whimsical quality to it . Sometimes in fairy tales more things seem possible , even though often they ' re real world based . I love that very traditional fairy tale where it ' s not all " happily ever after . " I like all that old school , bloody , " Brothers Grimm " sort of stuff . So you have all those shades of gray in there .
