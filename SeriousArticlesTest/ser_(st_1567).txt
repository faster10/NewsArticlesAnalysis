The civilized world is losing the war against terrorism . Jihadist attacks now take place in the midst of nations , strikes coming unexpectedly . Intelligence forces may be doing their best , but this is a fight in which every mistake , every missed extremist costs human lives . Nations can t seem to work out a coalition to combat Islamic State or put an end to the financing of jihadists and some of America s allies play a double game . Is there a way out ? Will the world come to its senses and extinguish extremism ?
