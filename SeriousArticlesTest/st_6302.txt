Kevin Durant ( hamstring ) wasn t able to play on Sunday , but there were a lot of rumblings around the league that he could return on Monday vs . the Jazz . Russell Westbrook once again took advantage of Durant s absence and scored 31 points in the win , adding 11 assists , five boards , five steals , one block and two treys . Westbrooks s numbers won t be as insane when Durant is back , but he will still be a first round value . Enes Kanter s ( 12 points , seven boards ) value will also decline next week , and it s a little worrying that he played just 23 minutes compared to the 25 minutes that Steven Adams ( six points , four boards ) saw . Serge Ibaka scored 16 points on 8 of 15 shooting with nine rebounds , one assist and one block , but he is a player who should actually benefit from the return of Durant . Ibaka is still a nice buy low target .
