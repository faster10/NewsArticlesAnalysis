If you didn ' t see LaFell on the field for his 33 snaps against the Broncos then you probably didn ' t know he played because he had no targets . It ended what was a disaster of a season for LaFell , who opened the year on the PUP list with a foot injury and finished with just 37 catches for 515 yards and no touchdowns on 74 targets . This was a huge step back from 2014 when he had 74 catches for 953 yards and seven touchdowns on 117 targets in his first year with New England . We ' ll see if LaFell is back with the Patriots next season since they can save 2 . 675 million by cutting him , but it ' s clear the team needs to upgrade at receiver based on the lack of talent on the outside . With Gronkowski , Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola , the Patriots are more than covered with options for Brady over the middle of the field . But they lack quality targets with speed on the outside even if LaFell can repeat his performance from 2014 . We ' ll see what happens with LaFell heading into 2016 , but if he ' s back with the Patriots and no upgrade is added then he ' s worth drafting with a late round pick in the majority of leagues . However , if things change with the Patriots roster or LaFell is released then his Fantasy value will certainly plummet .
