Of course , Nashville never allows progress without retreat , which is why the show began with a one two punch of down home nostalgia : Hank Williams Jr . and Eric Church growling their way through Neil Young s Are You Ready for the Country in front of an enormous American flag , followed by Keith Urban and John Mellencamp teaming up for Mellencamp s Pink Houses . ( Actually , the CMAs opened with a painfully unfunny Star Wars inspired bit by the show s hosts , Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood . But the less said about that , the better . )
