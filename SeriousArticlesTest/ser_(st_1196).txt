For those of you not old enough to remember , the ' 86 Mets were a gritty , gutty , never say die group . They were cocky , brash , in your face and backed it up on the field . They had a Hall of Fame catcher , one of greatest first baseman in the history of the game , as it turned out an absolute money closer , and a pitching staff with tons of talent , experience and serious onioins . Throw in 2 guys who would run through a wall for the team , a third baseman who used his bat as much as he used his fists and an absolute threat in right field , and you had a powerhouse team that wouldn ' t back down the anyone .
