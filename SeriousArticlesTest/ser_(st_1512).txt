Farron confesses he is ashamed of signing a letter with fellow Lib Dem MPs in 2006 which forced Charles Kennedy to resign as leader . He claims he was ' persuaded ' to do it by unnamed ' older MPs ' . Farron was too discreet to mention it , but it is a matter of record that Clegg , four years his senior , was among the signatories . For all his claims of loyalty , those who know Farron say he will have no regrets if Clegg resigns .
