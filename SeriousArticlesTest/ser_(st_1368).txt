Republicans need to put these distractions , which have nothing to do with Aponte ' s clear abilities , aside and recognize that her approval would be a win for the country . There is still time for Republicans to reconsider how important her work in El Salvador has been and how foolish and petty it would be for them to put politics before good policy . This is especially true in a region where we are fighting every day to turn back the influence of totalitarian regimes such as Cuba , and other regimes like Venezuela , that while technically democratic , engage in suppression and human rights violations . Aponte has been a true soldier for representative government , human rights and the rule of law .
