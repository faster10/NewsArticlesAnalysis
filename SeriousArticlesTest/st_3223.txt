Let ' s cut to the chase : Laquan McDonald ' s shooting and video are the wake up call to all Chicagoans that we need a New Chicago . A new mayor and a new city council . We cannot salvage a city that allows nine policemen to witness another police officer perform a 21st century lynching without reprimand . We must think our way out of old school Chicago corruption and into a diverse and productive 21st Century . What can the New Chicago look like ? A place where human beings are judged by the content of their character and not the color of their skin . . .
