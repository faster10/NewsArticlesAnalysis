It s probably an offensive line that has left Rodgers ducking for cover and missing reads he usually makes . Wait , it s probably the absence of injured WR Jordy Nelson and his ability to stretch defenses , draw the opponent s No . 1 corner and generally provide explosive plays . But actually , I think it s a lackluster running game and Eddie Lacy s failure to consistently draw extra defenders into the box to open things up downfield for Rodgers . ( Seriously , though , this is entirely Olivia Munn s fault )
