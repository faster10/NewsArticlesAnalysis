As the dancing wound down and the wedding cake was eaten I found Sean . He hadn t stopped smiling the whole night . I told him that I was heading back to my hotel , and he gave me a hug . After thanking me for coming , he grasped my hand . Love you , brother . Be safe . This is what we used to say before heading out on a mission . Hearing it on his wedding night felt like a punch to my stomach . I guess Sean had checked the headlines .
