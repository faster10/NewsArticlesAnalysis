Labour ' s combative Shadow Minister for Sport Clive Efford called it a ' bit rich ' that Tory incumbent Helen Grant is claiming their supporter ownership and engagement expert group announced this week was in the offing long before the Opposition ' s manifesto pledge to put fans on football club boards . Efford said Labour had been calling for the Government to form such a group since it was first mooted by the Arsenal Supporters ' Trust in 2011 . And Efford called it ' ridiculous ' that Grant had no concrete supporter proposals , unlike Labour .
