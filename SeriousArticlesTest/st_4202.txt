With original bassist Eric Avery , Jane ' s Addiction put a soundtrack to the gritty Southern California underground arts scene of the late 1980s . The group ' s first studio album , " Nothing ' s Shocking , " was an examination of love , lust , violence and drugs . By 1990 , the band was all over rock radio with " Stop ! " and " Been Caught Stealing , " a pair of hit singles off its sophomore disc , " Ritual de lo Habitual . " The new CD is only the group ' s fourth studio album .
