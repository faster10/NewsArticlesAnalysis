The President ' s detractors say he has no constitutional authority to give relief to so many people . While the courts may ultimately decide this , as someone who has worked in what was formerly known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service , I can tell you without question , the President indeed has prosecutorial discretion to decide which limited resources to dedicate to which undocumented immigrants he wants to deport . In fact , immigration officials , district attorneys and other law enforcement personnel exercise prosecutorial discretion every single day .
