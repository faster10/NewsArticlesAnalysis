And speaking of TV broadcasts , a tip of the cap to the announcing team of Gary Thorne , Steve Philips and John Kruk on " 2K12 .

Some of their phrases sounded exactly the same as last year , and there were a couple of games when I wondered if Karros had gone out for a pretzel and just never came back because he was heard so infrequently .
