Federal cuts in support for Planned Parenthood , even if offset in part by funding for other providers , would have a devastating impact on women in this country . Planned Parenthood health centers make up only 10 percent of publicly funded safety net providers , but they serve 36 percent of the clients seeking contraceptive services . In 103 counties with a Planned Parenthood health center , the Planned Parenthood facility serves all the women who are using safety net clinics to access contraceptive services . The defunding of Planned Parenthood would be particularly devastating for poor women and women living in remote areas .
