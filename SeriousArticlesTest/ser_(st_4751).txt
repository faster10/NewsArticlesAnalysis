" The Twitter conversation about these candidates diversified in the CNBC debate , with less of a solo spotlight on Mr Trump , " said Twitter ' s Adam Sharp . " In past debates , we ' ve seen him clearly lead in mentions on Twitter , followed by a clear ' anti Trump ' candidate and a significant drop off to the rest of the pack . On Wednesday , Trump was mentioned in 22 of the debate related Tweets ? a drop from 37 in the previous debate . Cruz , Carson , Rubio and Bush were all in a tight grouping next , with Cruz the biggest mover , making for the most evenly distributed Twitter conversation of the debates so far . "
