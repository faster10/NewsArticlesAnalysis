The Hawkeyes have faced good receivers , and they ve played against solid quarterbacks . But the Spartans All Big Ten tandem of Connor Cook and Aaron Burbridge stand above Iowa s competition through 12 games . Cook , healthy again after missing the Nov . 21 Ohio State game , ranks second in the league in opponent adjusted QBR and has thrown just four interceptions . MSU gains 240 yards per game through the air and averages 7 . 6 per pass attempt , also second in the Big Ten . Cornerback Desmond King is a star for Iowa and has grabbed a nation leading eight picks , but Iowa is vulnerable against a prolific passing attack .
