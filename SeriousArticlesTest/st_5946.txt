Oracle has been after Google since 2010 , claiming that Android uses Java ' s API without its permission . In 2012 , a judge found that Google did not infringe on Oracle ' s patents . The decision was , however , reversed in 2014 in Oracle ' s favor . Google has never denied of utilising Java APIs in Android , though it insists that APIs cannot be copyrighted . In the meanwhile , Google has announced that it will soon ditch the controversial Java API to use OpenJDK , which while still is made by Oracle , is open source .
