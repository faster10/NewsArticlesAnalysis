In 2007 , I saw him front Velvet Revolver at a sold out Avalon . Looking like a strung out skeleton and dressed as a flamboyant WWI flying ace complete with aviator glasses and pilot cap , Weiland spun around the stage ( more than once invoking Rose with his serpentine hips ) propelling the band through songs from its then forthcoming CD , " Libertad " and 2004 ' s " Contraband . " Good stuff , but something seemed off about the man and not just because the band went on 45 minutes late .
