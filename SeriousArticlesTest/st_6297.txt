The Nets got some revenge on the Celtics after they were beaten by them in their previous outing , and they were led by Brook Lopez who scored 23 points with 10 boards and one steal . His owners will probably have to live in fear because of his injury history , but he s returning top 40 value right now and should be fine as long as things don t get too crazy in Brooklyn . Jarrett Jack was solid as usual with 22 points , four boards and four assists , but don t be surprised to hear his name come up in trade rumors at the deadline . Thaddeus Young double doubled with 11 points and 12 boards , while Joe Johnson finished with 17 points and three treys in 36 minutes . I hope he enjoys his last season in Brooklyn , but I don t even want to pay him attention in fantasy leagues . Rookie Rondae Hollis Jefferson was wonderful with nine points , seven boards , four assists and five steals , and he saw 31 minutes of action for the second straight game . If you want him you will probably have to act now , and I do like his outlook for the rest of the season .
