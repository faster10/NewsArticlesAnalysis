The news alert for the Paris attacks came across my phone as I was about to officiate the marriage of my friend Sean , a veteran of multiple tours in Iraq whom I d fought alongside in Afghanistan . We had just finished the last rehearsals and Sean s small wedding party began to gather . The groomsmen , a rank of veterans in rented tuxedos , arrayed themselves on the crest of a bluff overlooking the evergreen studded ridge lines surrounding Carmel Valley , Calif . Nobody wore a uniform . We were civilians now , and ready to be . After the exchange of vows and recessional we gathered at a few outside cocktail tables . I could see people checking the headlines between toasts , but nobody spoke openly about the attacks . We didn t want the war to cast a shadow over the day . This wedding was a celebration of love but also a celebration of Sean s moving on . Away from wars .
