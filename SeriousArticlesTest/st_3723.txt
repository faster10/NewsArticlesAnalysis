AG : Yes . We live in a 3 dimensional world . My physics intuition , developed over the last thirty years , told me that this material shouldn ' t exist . And if you had asked 99 . 9 of scientists around the world they would have said the idea of a 2D material was rubbish and that graphene shouldn ' t exist . And in most cases they would have been right , but in the case of graphite or graphene , and a dozen other materials like it , our intuition was completely wrong . You can reach this limit of one atom thin layers .
