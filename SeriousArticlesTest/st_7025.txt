The other one is John Paul II again , this time visiting El Salvador . Oscar Romero had been made Archbishop of San Salvador in the late 1970s , and many people were hoping that he would become a balancing force in a country that seemed poised to explode . The story goes that Romero read the Bible and decided he needed to side with the poor , and he was accused by the right of inciting the poor to violence . Romero was assassinated in 1980 . The pope later visited Oscar Romero ' s tomb in 1983 and became very outspoken about what Romero stood for , about standing up for the rights of the poor and bringing an end to the civil war . And the pope was speaking against the existing government that was all Catholic . It ' s hard to say if his visit had a direct impact on poor people , but it certainly put the country and issues of poverty in the international spotlight .
