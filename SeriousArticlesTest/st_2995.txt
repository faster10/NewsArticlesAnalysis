Ukraine s sovereign debt to Russia dates back to a deal between President Vladimir Putin and former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich that was struck in 2013 and envisaged Moscow buying 15 billion worth of Ukrainian bonds . Russia bought 3 billion worth in December 20 , 2013 , and the debt is supposed to be repaid by December 20 , 2015 . In November , Russian President Vladimir Putin offered Kiev a three year installment plan to pay back , but no official answer to the proposal has been received .
