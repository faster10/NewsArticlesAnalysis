" When the proposed Trans Pacific Partnership was brought up , Trump said he was against the agreement and believed it was " designed for China to come in as they always do through the back door and totally take advantage of everyone . " Sen . Rand Paul quickly clarified that China is not part of the TPP , and said the country was actually against it because the U . S . will be trading with competitors . Regarding the Islamic State , Trump said the U . S . should not get involved militarily , and if Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to " knock the hell out of ISIS , I am all for it . " Paul said that unlike other candidates , he was against a no fly zone in Syria , adding : " You can be strong without being involved in every civil war around the world . " Toward the end of the debate , Trump was booed after he scolded Fiorina and asked , " Why does she keep interrupting everybody ? " The next Republican debate will be held in Las Vegas Dec . 15 .
