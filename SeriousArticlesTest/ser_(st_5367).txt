The Cowboys have lost four games in a row , but they ' re also coming off probably their best performance in a month ? and their best performance since quarterback Tony Romo went down with that shoulder injury ? in a 27 20 loss to the New York Giants on Sunday night . Dallas tied the game at 20 20 on a Matt Cassel to Devin Street touchdown hookup with seven minutes to go , but it promptly gave up a 100 yard kickoff return for a score and couldn ' t recover .
