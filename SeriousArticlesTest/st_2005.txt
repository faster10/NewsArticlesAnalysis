The Patriots , the Bengals and the Packers are perfect largely because of stellar quarterback play : Tom Brady , Andy Dalton and Aaron Rodgers are the three leaders in passer rating through six weeks . The Broncos are led by a dominant defense that has scored a touchdown in four of six games while leading the N . F . L . in sacks ( 26 ) , turnovers ( 17 ) and yards allowed per play ( 4 . 3 ) . Carolina s success is not so neatly defined , but strong defense , excellent fourth quarter play from quarterback Cam Newton and a friendly schedule has helped the Panthers remain unbeaten .
