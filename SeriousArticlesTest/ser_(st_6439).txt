The director nominees might be a sign that there ' s no gold on the surface of The Martian , as Ridley Scott was somehow left off the list . But a Best Picture win without the director ' s nomination happened as recently as Argo . All five nominees , meanwhile , have a horse in the Best Picture race ( I ? rritu , Adam McKay for The Big Short , George Miller for Mad Max : Fury Road , Lenny Abrahamson for Room and Tom McCarthy , Spotlight ) . Not a lot of clarity to be found there , either .
