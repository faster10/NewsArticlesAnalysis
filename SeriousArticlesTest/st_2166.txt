" Those tests do not reproduce what actually happens in everyday life , " Anderson said . " They are testing for certain conditions , for certain standards , but they test , for example , signals one at a time . They don ' t do a whole lot of signals altogether . Whereas in a car , you ' ve got a great cacophony of electromagnetic interference going on all the time , and you really can ' t rely on testing of a single frequency at one time . "
