There was some criticism of Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas after Friday s loss . Much of it focused on the notion that he was dribbling too much and not generating offense . I m sure he s frustrated by his 7 for 22 shooting night , not to mention his two missed shots that would have won the game , one at the end of regulation and the other at the end of the first overtime . Thomas did finish with the team s worst net rating ( 12 . 7 ) but he is still the heartbeat of this offense . He still finished with 18 points , 10 assists , and 6 rebounds .
