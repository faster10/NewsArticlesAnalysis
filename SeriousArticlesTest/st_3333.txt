None of this means Trump isn t a narcissist . The condition is practically the table stakes for anyone who considers running for president in the first place . Some studies ? most famously one by psychologist Ronald Deluga of Bryant University in Rhode Island ? have even used historical data and psychological diagnostic tools to rank all of the presidents on a narcissism scale . ( The winner , in case you were wondering , scoring 35 on a scale of 0 to 40 , was a dark horse : Chester A . Arthur , known in his time by the nickname dude of the White House ? a nod to his wardrobe , which included 80 pairs of pants , and his habit of changing his clothes three times a day . )
