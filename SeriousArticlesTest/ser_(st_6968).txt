Sen . Marco Rubio wrote an op ed for RedState , denouncing the whole complex of Iranian American deals as appeasement . This is the stuff of rhetorical hot air . What territory or interests did the United States cede in any of these deals ? Rubio , Trump , Sen . Ted Cruz , and others denounce the 150 billion that Obama is giving to Iran as part of the nuclear deal ? not acknowledging , in some cases perhaps not knowing , that the money ( more like 100 billion , minus 50 billion that will instantly go to pay off debts ) is Iran s own assets , which were frozen in response to Iran s nuclear program . Now that the program is largely dismantled , as required the assets are unfrozen . That s what the nuclear deal ? negotiated by the United States , Iran , and five other powers ( England , France , Russia , China , and Germany ) ? was all about .
