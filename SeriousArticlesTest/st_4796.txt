I think you have to look at the whole picture , O Brien said . I don t know if you can just put it on one guy . Did he make mistakes ? No question about it . But I think it s a combination of a lot of different things , starting with coaching . We have to coach it better . I think everybody just had to do better . We just weren t doing well enough . But I felt like at that time , during the whole game , I was going to stick with Brian .
