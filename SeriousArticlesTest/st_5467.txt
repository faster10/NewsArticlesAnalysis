A California native , Duke was inspired to play the piano after catching a Duke Ellington performance as a child . In 1997 , he told USA Today he remembered " seeing this guy in a white suit , playing this big thing , which I later found out was a piano . He had all these guys around him , and he was waving his hands conducting , and he spoke very intelligently and seemed to be having a good time . . . . I told my mom , ' I want to be him . ' That moment in time set the stage for me . "
