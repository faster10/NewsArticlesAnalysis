About a three hour drive south of the capital in Jacmel , there were reports of an orphanage that toppled , and of a hospital for women that collapsed , said Alana Salcer , spokeswoman for Cine Institute , a film school in Jacmel . Staff at the school and students there have written Salcer about the dire situation in that city , and even shot footage of buildings ripped open and survivors lying in streets . To keep the lights on and communication open , the school has had to rely on a generator after power lines went down .
