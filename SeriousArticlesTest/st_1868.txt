If the Titans only played the Jaguars at home , they ' d probably be undefeated in Nashville . Tennessee ' s win was their first home win all year and their first home win since October 2014 , when they also beat the Jags . The last time the Titans beat a team that wasn ' t the Jags at home came on Dec . 29 , 2013 , when they beat the Texans . Marcus Mariota showed off his wheels in the win , rushing for 112 yards and a touchdown . The rookie also threw for 268 yards and three touchdowns .
