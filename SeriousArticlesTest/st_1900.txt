The Texas senator brought up religious references and social conservatism on his own , as part of his routine stump speech ( though he was not always buttoned up ? his standard answer to questions about border security and ending sanctuary cities is Yes , yes and hell yes ) .

In Tilton , for example , he was asked about his personal relationship with God , a question that was repeated again the following day in another city .
