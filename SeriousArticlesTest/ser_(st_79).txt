The answer to that question , dear casting director , should be obvious : Nope , you don t cast a white actor to play Michael Jackson ? you get a black guy to play him , because MJ was black even when he was white . Just because our relationship and understanding of him evolved as his persona became more feminine and his skin tone more pale , that doesn t mean he was a fundamentally different person ? he was still the same guy who donned a wildly amazing fro on the cover of Off the Wall , the same dynamic superstar who had to fight to get his music videos played on MTV in the early 80s because they were reluctant to play black artists at the time . Even long after he had made his physical transformation and black people accused him of racial self hatred , he was still a guy who spoke unabashedly about how poorly the music industry has treated black artists in comparison to white ones . And even more obviously , you don t cast a white actor to play Michael Jackson , because you ve learned from the years of Hollywood whitewashing leading all the way up to last year , when Emma Stone was cast as an Asian character in Aloha .
