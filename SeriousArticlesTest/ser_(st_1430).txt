President Barack Obama did not say the word " terrorism " in his brief address , perhaps waiting until more facts are learned . We don ' t know how many are responsible , we don ' t know motive , if any , and we don ' t know whether it ' s domestic or foreign . But we do know the FBI said the explosions were well planned . We know the Boston Marathon is seen around the world . And we know three people are dead , including an 8 year old boy , more than 100 are injured , and countless lives have been scarred .
