Ponder this for a moment : it takes a flawed , deeply biased polling methodology to obscure Sanders ' real status , and to make Clinton seem like a dominant front runner . That kind of shenanigans and overwhelming pundit bias may well be the only things standing between Clinton and complete rout . Sanders ' success is , and continues to be , an untold wonder of the political world as in , it makes you wonder how much longer the fiction of Clinton ' s pre eminence can be maintained .
