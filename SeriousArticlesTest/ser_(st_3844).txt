Obama knew the media would take their eye off the ball if he distracted them with a passion play about GOP bigotry . He ridiculed Republicans for their cowardice and cruelty in raising concerns about the potential security threats posed by Syrian refugees . Never mind that such caution is informed in part by warnings from the heads of Obama s CIA , FBI and DHS . Obama ludicrously mocked the idea that we prioritize Christian refugees ? victims of Islamic State genocide ? as an Islamophobic religious test that was not American , even though his administration already gives special preference to Yazidi refugees from Iraq and federal law requires taking religion into account when screening refugees . For Obama , politics ends at the water s edge , unless he s speaking abroad .
