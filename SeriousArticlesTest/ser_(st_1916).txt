Carson Palmer and Brady should both be on anyone ' s list of top three MVP candidates this season . There would be a couple future Hall of Fame pass catchers in Rob Gronkowski and Larry Fitzgerald , and plenty of other stars on each offense . There is some great defensive talent on both sides as well . It would be the Patriots looking for their fifth Super Bowl of the Brady Belichick era and the Cardinals looking for their first Super Bowl ever ( they did win NFL championships in 1925 and 1947 as the Chicago Cardinals , for you history buffs ) .
