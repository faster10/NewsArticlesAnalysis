With community based care , the CHWs are able to expand services to reach more women and newborns . For example , in the Millennium Village of Sauri in Kenya , nearly all pregnant women are receiving HIV counseling and testing , compared with fewer than half in 2008 . Children who do become infected with HIV are diagnosed earlier and given timely access to HIV treatment , care and support . The community health workers are also playing a growing role in identifying bottlenecks and implementing solutions by engaging decision makers from local to national levels . Challenges such as low acceptance of HIV counseling and testing , commodity stock outs and infant feeding issues are being identified and addressed with local responses .
