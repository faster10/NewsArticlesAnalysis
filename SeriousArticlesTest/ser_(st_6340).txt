It isn ' t like we weren ' t warned . Just five years ago , an Air France Airbus took off from Rio de Janeiro for a routine 5 , 700 mile trip to Paris . But the plane never arrived . Although the airline had received telemetric data that something was going terribly wrong and indicating in general where the plane had crashed , only the recovery of some large floating pieces of wreckage helped narrow the search area . Even after the search area was relatively quickly identified , the all important flight recorders weren ' t recovered for another two years .
