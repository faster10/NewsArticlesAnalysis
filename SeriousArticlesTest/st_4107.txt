Late Wednesday afternoon word leaked that McAdoo was the Eagles guy to replace Kelly , who did a fine job ripping apart the roster in three years . McAdoo was the first candidate interviewed by the Giants on Jan . 5 , just hours after Coughlin s farewell news conference .

Jackson cancelled his interview with the Giants .
