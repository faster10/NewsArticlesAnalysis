But Lorenzana said , " I don ' t want to be famous , I try to stay away from that . I just want to be an example , that ' s all . If people in the future still remember my name , I want to be remembered as a woman who stood up for her rights . " Apparently , Lorenzana also appeared in a 2003 plastic surgery documentary saying she ' d like to be stacked like " a little Playboy Playmate . " But that ' s neither here nor there . . .
