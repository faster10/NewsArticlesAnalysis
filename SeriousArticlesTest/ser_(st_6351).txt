Mets : Wilmer Flores . Nearly traded in late July , Flores became an instant fan favorite when cameras caught him crying during a game because he thought he ' d been jettisoned by the only organization he ' s ever played for . He began the season as the starter and took over again in the playoffs when Ruben Tejada broke his leg on a late takeout slide by Chase Utley of the Dodgers . Flores had 16 homers this year and delivered several clutch hits . He ' s limited on defense but has been more consistent since his early season struggles .
