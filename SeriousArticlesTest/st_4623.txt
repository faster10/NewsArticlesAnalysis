That is one of the big differences between US and UK political language ? the profession of speech writer is fully established in America . It is recognised and individual writers like Ted Sorenson who wrote for JFK are renowned . Language is one of the great political legacies ? living on and influencing powerfully long after well meaning White Papers are forgotten . That s why in the States and Australia it s not just a profession but their memoirs are commissioned and published . Speechwriters are some of the most interesting people to tell you about their principals ? Graham Freudenberg on Gough Whitlam , say , or Don Cameron on Paul Keating . Though , as often in politics , the best speechwriter s book may be about failure . Barton Swaim s Speech writer : A Brief Education in Politics is the story of working for a politician who crashed and burned ? South Carolina s Mark Sanford . Best known as the Governor who claimed to be hiking the Appalachian Trail when he was meeting his lover which really meant meeting my lover in Buenos Aires . His press conference at which he confessed to the affair is still worth a horrified watch . Sanford attempted a second act and was elected to Congress . Swaim s book documents how and why that was not a return to glory .
