" The No . 1 was a big deal for me six years in a row . I played in Europe for about two months to do it . That was huge for me , that ' s a big record . To beat Roy Emerson at Wimbledon with my parents there , beating Patrick Rafter , a great Australian , it was great way to do it . It was 9 o ' clock at night , it was a storybook ending , quite an emotional time for me .
