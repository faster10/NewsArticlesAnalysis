Whether you are a James Bond addict who knows all 24 films nearly by heart or a reluctant cinemagoer who wishes that the series would just mercifully end , you will likely agree that Spectre starts promisingly enough . A long , impressive tracking shot establishes 007 in Mexico City as he takes in a Day of the Dead Parade with a woman on his arm . He nimbly climbs over some rooftops , assassinates several terrorists , and finds himself in a helicopter that is spinning around like a fighter jet . Cue the opening titles and a visit to M s office , where it initially appears as if we may be returning to the old Bond formula : minimovie teaser , mission briefing , mission .
