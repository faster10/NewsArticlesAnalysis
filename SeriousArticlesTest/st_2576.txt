We know the governing bodies of some world sports have been riddled with corruption . That much is proven . But we don t really care . Not really . These men can line their pockets , and give the World Cup to the most unsuitable country on earth , as long as the simple integrity of what takes place on the field is not undermined . In the end , the purity of the action , the fact that the naked eye can see everything that s happening , is the only thing we care about . And the damage to tennis of a climate in which we see a forehand and think of a backhander is incalculable .
