Surely it ' s time to start educating Jack and have somebody explain to him how to behave . If he was smoking that pipe , even if it doesn ' t do him any serious damage as a player I wouldn ' t put myself in that position . The goalkeeper has already lost his place over a smoking issue so you would never dream of being seen with anything cigarette , shisha , lager , anything . Being in the team means so much to you and is such a reward for your efforts that it ' s not worth that risk . He is obviously going out and thinks he is in a private situation but you never are as a footballer , there is always somebody on the lookout . You have to be squeaky clean and if you are serious about your football that ' s how you should want to live anyway .
