The DB10 marks 50 years of Aston Martins in James Bond films . In fact , 12 of the 24 Bond cars have been Astons ? more than any other brand . Although you might not be able to buy the DB10 like other Bond cars ( including an AMC Hornet and Renault 11 ) , I dare say the DB10 might be one of the coolest . In fact , it ' s the fact that you can ' t buy the car that adds to its allure . People famously want what they can ' t have . But when the 2017 DB11 comes out , you ' ll essentially be able to one up 007 . . . How cool is that ?
