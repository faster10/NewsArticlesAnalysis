Krasny Liman is a town of some 20 , 000 people and a major railway junction . But one of its two hospitals is in ruins , struck repeatedly by what appeared to have been mortars or shells . There was also evidence of strafing from the air . A tearful nurse approached us , saying that whoever had done this was not human . She and others thought Ukrainian forces were responsible , but they could not be sure . Patients had been evacuated , but one middle aged man sat listlessly on a bench outside . He had nowhere to go , he told us a doctor came past once a day to give him an injection .
