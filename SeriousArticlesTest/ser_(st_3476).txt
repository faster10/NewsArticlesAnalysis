So as I leave Commander ' s Palace , I walk across the street to a little art galley . Inside , it is cool . The owner and some friends are chatting amid bright images of the bayous , wildlife and the town itself . I stroll around looking at the art , and through the windows at the neighborhood outside , and it is easy to see the beguiling charm coming through once again , the beauty and uniqueness that have drawn visitors here for 300 years , and five years after the disaster , is calling them down to the river again .
