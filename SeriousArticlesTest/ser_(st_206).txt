The stakes , though , are much higher . Neither the Panthers nor the Cardinals has won a Super Bowl , and one of those teams will get another chance at it . It could very well be the Panthers , who have a 16 1 record and yet are largely overlooked . They would become the ninth team to advance to the big game with one or no losses , and the first one loss team to do so since the 1985 Bears ( the 2007 Patriots were 18 0 going into Super Bowl XLII ) .
