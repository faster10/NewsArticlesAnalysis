Meanwhile , the news out of East Rutherford prompted the Eagles to intensify their talks with Coughlin . Best case scenario : Coughlin had wanted McAdoo to be his offensive coordinator and Steve Spagnuolo to be his defensive coordinator . McAdoo was obviously not available and he wanted to retain Spags , who was under contract to the Giants . Coughlin wanted to bring many other of his coaches from his Giants staff to Philly . Not only were they under contract and McAdoo wanted to keep them , but the feeling among Coughlin insiders was the only way the Giants would have considered releasing any of them was if Coughlin took a job outside the NFC East .
