Workers were willing to use nonlethal force to defend their occupations , and they managed to repel attempts to forcibly remove them . The number of strikes mushroomed . In 1937 alone , roughly 400 , 000 workers participated in nearly 500 sit down strikes . The GM sit down strike in Flint involved tens of thousands of workers and was resolved just as the Supreme Court was hearing arguments in a pivotal case concerning the constitutionality of federal labor laws . Indeed , several legal historians attribute the court ' s famous " switch in time " upholding the National Labor Relations Act in the case of NLRB v . Jones Laughlin Steel Corp . to the sit down strikes .
