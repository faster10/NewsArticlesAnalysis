Hollywood learned this very lesson years ago when it made mafia movies with no Italian Americans involved in the creative process or as stars . Those films failed because they lacked any true understanding of Italian culture , which would have enhanced the film . That changed when Paramount Studios hired Francis Ford Coppola , then a little known director , to helm " The Godfather . " In turn , Coppola hired talented but unknown Italian American actors such as Al Pacino and John Cazale ( " Fredo Corleone " ) to be co stars . The rest is cinematic history .
