If the reports are true , and guys like Scott Rabalais of The Baton Rouge Advocate and Tommy Krysan of Pelican Sports Network are respected and trustworthy , then it would seem Les Miles will coach the LSU Tigers once more , when they host Texas A M this Saturday . Will Mark Richt be coaching his last game as Georgia s head coach on Saturday when the Bulldogs play Georgia Tech in Atlanta ? ( Lose to the 3 8 Yellow Jackets and that answer will be an easy YES . )
