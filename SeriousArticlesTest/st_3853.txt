It ' s just an estimate , and it ' s always possible that other things that processed meat eaters tend to do such as standing around grills full of burning charcoal raise their cancer risk . Still , it wouldn ' t be unreasonable to make changes in your diet based on this evidence ( and similar but weaker evidence on the link between red meat and cancer ) . I like bacon a lot , but I ' d rather have a five in 100 chance of getting colorectal cancer than a six in 100 chance . Good on the World Health Organization for getting the word out . What I don ' t understand , though , is why they didn ' t present the risks in those terms .
