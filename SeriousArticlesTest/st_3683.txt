An inquiry led by senior British judge Robert Owen found that former KGB bodyguard Andrei Lugovoy and another Russian , Dmitry Kovtun , carried out the killing as part of an operation probably directed by Russia ' s Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , the main heir to the Soviet era KGB . " The FSB operation to kill Mr Litvinenko was probably approved by Mr Patrushev , then head of the FSB , and also by President Putin , " Owen said . " I have concluded that there is a strong probability that when Mr Lugovoy poisoned Mr Litvinenko , he did so under the direction of the FSB . I have further concluded that Mr Kovtun was also acting under FSB direction , " he said .
