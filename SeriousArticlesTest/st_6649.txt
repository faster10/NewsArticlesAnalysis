Defense : As you ' d expect , Giants star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr . put up big numbers . That ' s what he does . He caught six passes ( on 11 targets ) for 149 yards and a 72 yard touchdown . Tight end Will Tye had a 45 yard catch to set up a field goal drive . But other than those two plays , the Jets allowed just 238 yards . Rarely used safety Rontez Miles had a big fourth down interception to help prevent a touchdown . The Jets sacked Eli Manning three times , including the team leading ninth sack of the year for defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson . The Jets held the Giants to an 0 of 3 showing on scoring touchdowns in the red zone , while not allowing the Giants to score a single point after they entered halftime up 20 10 . The Giants ' drives in the second half and overtime netted 9 , 11 , 28 , 30 , and 67 yards . The 67 yarder ended with Miles ' pick after Giants coach Tom Coughlin opted to not kick a field goal ? a dubious decision . ( Take Ivory ' s fumble into account , along with a Giants special teams touchdown , and the Jets ' defense really gave up 10 points Sunday , though it was technically 13 . ) ?
