' Jules ' neurological condition remains stable . Although the situation continues to be serious , and may remain so , it was decided that Jules was sufficiently stable to be repatriated to his native France . We are relieved , therefore , to confirm that Jules was transferred aeromedically last night from the Mie Prefectural General Medical Center in Yokkaichi , Japan , to Le Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice ( CHU ) , where he arrived just a short time ago . Jules is now in the intensive care unit of Professors Raucoules and Ichai , where his care will also be monitored by Professor Paquis , Head of Neurosurgery Service .
