As professional musicians , most of us know what kind of power music has in terms of dealing with the things that are going on in your life . And the reasons that we target the neighborhoods that we have the program in are because these kids are facing the most challenges with being successful in and out of school . A lot of times , these kids only see to the end of their block and back . We like to bring them to studios and also to other places in Miami because we want them to experience something outside of their own neighborhood .
