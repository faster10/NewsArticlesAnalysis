" If one allows the infidels to continue playing their role of corrupters on Earth , their eventual moral punishment will be all the stronger . Thus , if we kill the infidels in order to put a stop to their corrupting activities , we have indeed done them a service . For their eventual punishment will be less . To allow the infidels to stay alive means to let them do more corrupting . To kill them is a surgical operation commanded by Allah the Creator . " Ayatollah Khomeini , 1984
