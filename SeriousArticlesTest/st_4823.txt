Because Oklahoma is this year s strongest contender to end the Kansas streak of 11 straight Big 12 regular season titles . A win in Phog Allen would be a huge step towards accomplishing that feat .

Everyone in the conference is getting a game at Kansas , which may very well be the toughest place in college basketball to get a win . This isn t the kind of game that can make or break a season , not by any stretch of the imagination , but the impact of a Sooner win will be felt in March .
