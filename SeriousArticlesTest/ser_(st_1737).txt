Not many local players get the chance to start their career , or spend most of it , with the home team . Some of that is merely by chance Rose just happened to be the best player in college basketball and the Bulls owned the No . 1 pick in the draft . But some teams are allergic to drafting or trading for locals because they worry about the demands placed on the player : old blood sucking friends and pressure to play well . When these players fail spectacularly the way Stephon Marbury did in New York with the Knicks , they crumble twice as hard . They ' re not locals anymore they ' re home groan .
