Pro Football Focus has the Panthers graded out as the eighth best pass blocking unit in the league so far this season . Last year , they were 26th . Football Outsiders has a few different offensive line stats to measure their contribution to the running game . Carolina ranks 14th in Adjusted Line Yards ( which attributes credit to the offensive line based on a percentage of yards gained ) , seventh in Power Success ( conversion rate on third or fourth down with 2 or fewer yards to go ) , and eighth in Stuffed Percentage ( percentage of runs stopped behind the line of scrimmage ) . In the same stats , they were 27th , 10th , and 17th last season . Add up all of those gains and it becomes easy to see how Cam and Jonathan Stewart are being put in position to succeed on a play to play basis .
