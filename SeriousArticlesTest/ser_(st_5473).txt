Nadal broke in the second game and quickly built a 3 0 advantage in the opening set on Wednesday , and two more break points in the second set was all the seventh seed needed to move on . He s pretty offensive , he tries to attack , he goes for big first serves , he doesn t just roll the serve in , he tries to serve aces , he ll come up to the net when he has the chance . Fellow Frenchman Jo Wilfried Tsonga had no trouble with Roberto Bautista Agut . Nadal will play the victor of the 2 round match between Kevin Anderson and Dominic Thiem . It was a stark contrast from their match last week in Basel where Nadal dropped the first set 6 1 and trailed by a break in the second set before turning things around for a three set win .
