Unfortunately , the VA decided to narrow the interpretation of the 40 mile rule , choosing to take into account only the distance of a VA medical facility from a veteran ' s home and not whether the VA facility can actually provide the services the veteran needs . Veterans are being told they cannot use their Choice Cards because they live within 40 miles of a VA facility , even though that facility does not offer the care they require . The VA is denying the access the law was intended to provide and forcing veterans to choose between traveling hours to a VA medical facility , paying out of pocket or going without care altogether .
