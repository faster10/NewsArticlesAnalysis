Leguizamo : There are a lot of great reasons . First of all , we all want to lower our carbon footprint , and this is one of the great ways , reduce pollution , reduce traffic , reduce noise pollution , improve your heart with reduced stress . When you ' re out there , it makes you friendlier . You get a little bike rage , but that ' s only when people cross you . I usually get to places with a lot of great energy and a lot more relaxed .
