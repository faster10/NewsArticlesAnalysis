The Guardian has the Chicago police dash cam video of Laquan McDonald ' s final moments , where the 17 year old is shot 16 times walking away from officers , and certainly did not continue " to approach the officers , " as stated initially by law enforcement . Reminiscent of the death of John Crawford , The Atlantic writes that " Van Dyke opened fire only 30 seconds after arriving on the scene and just six seconds after exiting his vehicle . " In a testament to Chicago politics , the officer charged in Laquan McDonald ' s shooting is also linked to another possible cover up in a shooting almost one decade earlier .
