Nothing says Old Florida like acres of citrus trees . Picking your own oranges is always refreshingly rewarding . For more than 20 years , family owned Ridge Island Groves has touted all things orange , everything from freshly squeezed orange juice to homemade orange ice cream . Take a golf cart tour of the rural groves and fill your bag with juicy Valencia oranges , plus honey Murcott tangerines and ruby red grapefruits . Then head to the charming outdoor store where shelves are stocked with Bone Hot Suckin ' Sauce , pear preserves , pumpkin butter , pickled okra and corn relish , among many others .
