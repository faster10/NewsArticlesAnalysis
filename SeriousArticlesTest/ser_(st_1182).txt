Minnesota has held each of its first six opponents to 23 points or fewer and used Adrian Peterson and the rushing game to hold on to the ball for nearly 36 1 2 minutes in a 28 19 triumph over Detroit last week . Peterson blamed eating shrimp for an illness that briefly pushed him into the questionable category last week , but he rumbled for 98 yards in the win and is battling through nagging injuries to his hip , finger and ankle . " It ' s going to take 11 guys playing good run defense to get ( Peterson ) stopped , " Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio told reporters . " You can be going along fine with him and then , all of a sudden , he breaks a 40 or 50 yarder or more . So you ' ve got to be on point with him all the time . " Chicago ' s defense enters the week 25th against the run , allowing opposing teams an average of 124 . 8 yards .
