Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a barnstorming performance as the embattled Glass , whose quest for survival takes him on a Herzogian odyssey to the very borders of life and death . Having previously been Oscar nominated for What s Eating Gilbert Grape , The Aviator , Blood Diamond and most recently The Wolf of Wall Street , it s clearly DiCaprio s turn to triumph with a performance which relies more upon physicality than the spoken word . Academy voters like to see their actors suffer , and there s a tangible mondo tinge to scenes of Leo plunging into icy waters , being buried alive , chomping down on raw bison liver , and crawling into a still warm animal carcass to sleep . Meanwhile , the freezing temperatures of the breathtaking environment ( all filmed in natural light ) seem to seep into his very bones by comparison The Hateful Eight looks like a summer holiday .
