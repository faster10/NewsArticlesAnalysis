The practice of barring pregnant girls from attending school and partaking of this exam has been informally enforced for years . However , Amnesty International published a report on Friday that advised that , in April , the government officially condoned the practice and made banning any visibly pregnant girls from attending schools and taking these exams a part of state policy . The policy will now negatively affect approximately 10 , 000 of Sierra Leone s school age girls . The announcement came right as many of the schools that had been closed for nine months , due to the country s battle with Ebola , were reopened . The Ebola epidemic claimed the lives of nearly 4 , 000 people in Sierra Leone .
