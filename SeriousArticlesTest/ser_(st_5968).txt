Also , not all smartphones are created equal . The low cost Android market ( particularly Android phones that can be obtained for less than 200 on no contract plans ) generally have slower processors , are running older versions of the Android operating system ( which may not support popular apps ) and often are harder to use or more cheaply made . As the Ice Cream Sandwich operating system becomes the norm for higher end Android devices this year , you can bet that many people with cheap Android phones will still be running Gingerbread , unable to upgrade .
