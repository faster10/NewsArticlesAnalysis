For all the talk of his ability to finance his campaign , he s currently getting a relatively free ride . He seeded his campaign with about 1 . 9 million but reported contributing just 100 , 779 during the past fundraising quarter . ( Meanwhile , his campaign brought in a total of 3 . 6 million from people not named Donald J . Trump . ) While his rivals and their affiliated super PACs are spending millions to get their faces on TV , Trump gets significantly more airtime simply by picking up the phone and calling one of the cable news networks . A third party run would cost more than the 2 million he s invested so far , but Trump clearly has the money it would take . He could also do it on the cheap if the goal isn t to win but merely to look strong enough to be treated like a major candidate by the political press .
