We , the international community , must not turn a blind eye to what ' s happening in on Mount Sinjar like we did in the wake of the expulsion of Mosuli Christians or the mass executions of Shiite soldiers . What ' s transpiring now is a new Kosovo , an ethno religious cleansing on a huge scale . That it is taking place at the hands of a jihadist group too extreme for al Qaeda , a group that has repeatedly shown that it has internationalist ambitions , is all the more worrying . It is ludicrous that no one has acted against it already when it is clear that neither the IAF nor the Peshmerga is capable of shutting it down alone .
