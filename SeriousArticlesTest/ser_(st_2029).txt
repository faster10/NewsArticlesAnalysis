That doesn ' t mean I don ' t wish Eastwood made a more balanced film that would let audiences see the brutality and suffering of both sides in the conflict . There isn ' t any reference , for example , to the horrors of Abu Ghraib prison where U . S . soldiers infamously tortured Iraqis . Nor was there any reference to the 2006 massacre in Haditha , Iraq , which happened during the period Kyle was in Iraq . That ' s when U . S . Marines went on a killing spree and slaughtered 24 unarmed Iraqis including women , children and an elderly man in a wheel chair .
