On the C Lazy U ranch in Granby , I met one political commentator from the right , one from the left and one in the middle . And I immediately understood the predicament . Colorado is a frontier state hardy , rugged , mountainous , with winters that are not for the faint hearted . But it is also a fair state , with a liberal tradition on social issues ( a proposal to legalize marijuana is on the ballot paper this year ) . In 2008 they liked the idea of change , and gave Obama a 9 victory . Now that undecided element is in play again and there is confusion about which way it will move .
