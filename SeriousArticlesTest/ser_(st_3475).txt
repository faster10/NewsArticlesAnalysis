As a former resident , I have some reference points . I know how incomparably lovely a streetcar ride to Uptown can be , followed by a long , lingering seafood dinner amid friends . I have walked all night in the Quarter , and enjoyed beignets nestled in mounds of powdered sugar as thick waves of fog rolled off of the river like something from a movie . I have danced until dawn in a steamy music club and walked out to the singing of mockingbirds and sunrise lighting up the live oak trees . In short , I have loved this town like no other for a lifetime .
