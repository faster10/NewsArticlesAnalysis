Morgenstern : It kind of came about by accident , I was actually working on a different book . I started doing national novel writing month about eight years ago and I started writing this Edward Gorey inspired plot . I didn ' t know where I was going with it , so I decided to send all the characters to the circus . I started with these little vignettes and it didn ' t have a plot for the longest time , but that ' s kind of where it started . It ' s been a long strange trip . The idea came together in 2006 . I worked on it in fits and starts and didn ' t take it real seriously at first . I wasn ' t thinking at that point about trying to get published , I was writing just to write . Then in 2008 I started to think I might have something . I tried to make the story a little more book shaped , not so sprawling and nonlinear and more resembling a novel . Then I started querying agents in 2009 and got a lot of favorable responses but pretty much everyone said it had no plot . So I ended up doing a lot of revising and that ' s actually the version of the book that ended up getting me signed . Then I did even more revisions . This book has been revised many , many , many times . It ' s changed so much that I didn ' t I feel like I was working on one book for that long because I wasn ' t working on it continuously and because it changed so much .
