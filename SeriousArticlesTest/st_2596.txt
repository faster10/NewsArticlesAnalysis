We are judged by God on our intentions not our outcomes so the only thing we can do and must do is continue to lead by example . Continue to condemn violence in all shapes and forms against any and all people . Continue to pray for the victims of violence . And keep trying to manage the situation through the political process . We must vote . We must vote in politicians that think diplomatically as their first , second and third course of action . Not pressing the war button . You want to say religion is spread by the sword what are modern governments doing today ? The sword is now : drones , bombs , tanks and a huge money making apparatus with a huge price in human toll .
