Sitting out the Des Moines debate is a gamble , but so would be taking part . Trump would have almost certainly drawn heavy fire from the Fox News moderators and from his chief rival , Ted Cruz . In the past , he s managed to survive those attacks individually ? but he never faced both at the same time . What s more , his absence will leave Cruz as the only front runner on stage and , as a result , the focus of a few more broadsides from his polling challenged rivals than he otherwise might have faced . The boycott , meanwhile , allows Trump to play to type by showing his fans that he s the give no quarter negotiator he brands himself as and once again allows him to flex his muscles for a GOP electorate that loves to see a show of strength . The biggest benefit , meanwhile , is that his decision ensures that Trump will remain the political story in the final days before Iowa . After seven plus months of relentless coverage , the Donald will sleep easy knowing that Thursday s Trump less debate ? and the lead up to it ? will still be all about Trump . In that way , his decision reflects no change in strategy at all .
