I was trying to give hope for people that may be a step outside the box from being labeled , this player , that player , he said . For me , I ve always kind of viewed things differently , played differently . Not in the prototypical way . So for that athletic quarterback coming out , for that person that may have made a mistake in their life , they can look at me and say , Well , Cam did it . So I can still have hope to do it . Whether you go to a major Division I school or not , or you go the junior college route or not , you still have an opportunity to live out your dreams .
