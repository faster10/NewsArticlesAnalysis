The sit down strike movement began January 27 , 1936 , when workers at the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co . in Akron , Ohio , sat down on the job to protest the company ' s suspension of an official in the workers ' union . Fifty five hours later , the company capitulated , reinstating the union official with back pay and even compensating the strikers ( at half pay ) for the time during which they occupied the plant . Successful imitation strikes were soon launched at other tire factories .
