Put simply , the U . S . never put in place the strategic and political framework to make much headway in Afghanistan . Despite the renewed push for negotiations with the Taliban , there is no political strategy for the country . There is no end state for the war , either right now , the plan is to drawdown to about 20 , 000 troops or so similar to troop levels in 2008 and stay that way for the indefinite future . That ' s not a strategy , and it ' s not a plan .
