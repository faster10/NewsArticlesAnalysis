I can see how , at first glance , such comments might seem to make sense . They make sense in the way a drinking buddy spouting off at a bar makes sense . Tough talk has a gut appeal , and it is easier to comprehend the world s problems if they are presented in the simple terms of a street fight . Still , even a person with only a passing acquaintance with the complexities of the Mideast or American constitutional law could quickly deduce that Trump has not thought this all through . He is like a kid saying the first thing that pops into his head when someone asks a current events question . ?
