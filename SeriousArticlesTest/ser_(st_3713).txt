The network addressed the NBC WSJ poll in a statement attributed to the Fox News Decision Desk : " Our usage of the WSJ NBC News poll , which we consider a very high quality survey , merits comment , " the statement read . " The October 2015 WSJ NBC News poll named 10 Republican candidates in its ballot question . As such , we consider it an appropriate survey for gauging support for the 7th through 10th place candidates who are either above or close to the 2 . 5 percent threshold . The August WSJ NBC News poll used this same methodology and we did not include it in the calculation of which candidates were in the top 10 for the first FOX News Republican debate . The main reason was that failing to provide a full listing of candidates made it less appropriate for differentiating between the candidates ranked tenth or higher and the ones ranked eleventh or lower .
