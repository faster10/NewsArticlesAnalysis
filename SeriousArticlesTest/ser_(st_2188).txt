Contrary to what Republican politicians tell us , private businesses don ' t run out and create jobs just because we throw tax breaks at them and profess our love . If the government doesn ' t create demand , then we will be doomed to a long period of high unemployment just as we saw in the Great Depression . The government could fill the demand gap by spending on infrastructure , education and other areas , but in a political world where higher spending is strictly verboten , that doesn ' t seem likely .
