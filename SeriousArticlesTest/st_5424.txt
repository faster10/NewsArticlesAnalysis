Rafale was chosen as the IAF s Medium Multi Role Combat Aircraft ( MMRCA ) after a gruelling selection process and declared winner in January 2012 . Ever since , the two countries were engaged in complex technical and commercial negotiations . 126 aircraft were initially planned to be contracted in a near 20 billion dollar deal , but during Prime Minister Modi s April 2015 visit to France , the two sides announced an in principle deal for 36 ready to fly Rafale aircrafts at a reportedly concessional price offer . After repeat exchange of delegations , the deal may now have been wrapped up . While the French have reportedly agreed to the reduced price and technology transfer , India has reportedly agreed to reduce offsets from 50 to 30 percent . The benchmark price has already been set in the Egypt and Qatar deals . Qatar is paying US 7 billion for 24 Rafale aircrafts . Can it be cheaper for India ?
