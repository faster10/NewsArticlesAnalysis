We have to look at this problem as both a Sunni and a Shia problem , and we have to look at the components of both of those forms of the Islamic religion , and then we really have to dig deep down and begin to examine , where is this radicalization coming from . And that is going to have to be changed ? we cannot continue to have the world look at Islam as a radical form of a political ideology , based on its religion . ? And I don t think that the moderate leaders of the Arab world , of the Muslim world they don t want that either . But they have to do more as well . So very complex . . . and it is a situation where I really believe that the best way forward is for us to mutually agree that we have common interest and we ve got to figure out how to work together , to achieve those common interests . ? ?
