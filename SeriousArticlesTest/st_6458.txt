Horowitz : An agent approached me , but in the end I had very little to do with the estate . It was important to me that I should be allowed to work on my own so nobody gave me notes , I didn ' t have to show my manuscript to the estate , I wasn ' t told what I could or couldn ' t do . To be fair to the estate , they put their complete trust in me and I hope I ' ve repaid it .
