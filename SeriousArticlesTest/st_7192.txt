Sierra Derrick of Waymart , Pennsylvania " This is the second time my husband is deploying to Iraq , and trust me , it only gets harder ! ! The first time , I was 17 years old , two months pregnant and a brand new bride . ( We got married literally the day before he left . ) Now , exactly four years later , we are in the same situation , although things are a little different . Together we have two amazingly beautiful little boys , Connor and Carson , ages 3 and 1 . Needless to say , he is their hero as well as mine .
