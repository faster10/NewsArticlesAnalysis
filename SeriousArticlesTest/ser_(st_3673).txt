Conventional political wisdom still clings fanatically to the recipe that Sanders studiously and deliberately avoids . If he clinches the nomination ( and , to be honest , if you get outside the conventional wisdom enough to see what his campaign has accomplished , that seems quite plausible ) , history may record this election as the one where major media political coverage was rendered obsolete and perhaps even deem it more revolutionary than 2008 . Sanders himself has made no bones about calling for a revolution . True to prediction , it has so far not been televised .
