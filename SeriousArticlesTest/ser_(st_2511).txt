As a Pats fan this was the one matchup I did not want to see . Not sure why some of my fellow Pats fans are so confident . they shouldn t be . K . C . really didn t play up to their potential on offense last week and still put up 30 points . I know they are going against Brady not Hoyer and we are getting Edelman back and those things do count . However , Edelman will be rusty having not played for 8 weeks and the offensive line had better gets it s act together or it could be a long Sunday . The Chiefs should be respected . They are a very good team . 11 wins in a row is no joke .
