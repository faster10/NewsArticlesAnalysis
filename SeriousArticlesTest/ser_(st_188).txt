As Bowie advanced into his 50s , his creative output began to wane . Following the release of 2003 s Reality he had planned a massive world tour , but the trek had to be cut short when a blocked artery required surgery , and he performed his last full concert in Germany on June 25 , 2004 . ( His final performance would be a Changes duet with Alicia Keys in New York City in 2006 . ) Still , he continued to be a champion of new sounds ? he could often be seen scoping out indie rock bands in New York s downtown clubs ? and collaborated with such acts as Arcade Fire and TV on the Radio . Every report I d heard about meeting Bowie suggests that the guy was really , really good at meeting people and making them feel like a million bucks , recalled Arcade Fire s Owen Pallett , who recorded with Bowie on the title track to the band s 2013 album Reflektor . But no words could really describe the man s complete generosity of spirit , intelligence and charisma .
