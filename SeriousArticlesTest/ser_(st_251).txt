One reason to panic : The Saints ' defense deserves credit for a huge three and out in the final minute that gave them a chance to kick the game winning field goal . And they actually held New York to just 1 for 8 on third down . But the secondary was porous , giving up six touchdown passes by Eli Manning . Cornerback Delvin Breaux had a rough day , allowing three TDs to Odell Beckham Jr . And Breaux and Brandon Browner were flagged for costly penalties .
