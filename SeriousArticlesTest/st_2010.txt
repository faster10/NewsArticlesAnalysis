Talks for the sake of talks should be avoided . Both the countries should do some serious introspection and adopt a pragmatic approach if they are really serious in taking the talks forward . Nawaz Sharif ' s recent offer of unconditional talks with India during his meeting with British Premier David Cameron on the sidelines of the Commonwealth summit in Malta has largely gone unnoticed in India as New Delhi has not even bothered to take note of it , leave aside making any comments . Pakistan needs to understand that talks and terror can ? t go hand in hand . At a time , when the world has been rattled by a series of bloody terrorist activities , the sentiments are running high against terrorist groups . And to expect India to enter into talks with Pakistan as long as it is seen as in collusion with terrorist groups is asking for too much . Pakistan needs to make some forward movement in this regard before it can hope for resumption of normal ties .
