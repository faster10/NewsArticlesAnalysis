If Joss came out and said , " I want to make a new Buffy movie , " even if he said , " I want to do it like the reboot of Spider Man . I want to put Buffy back in high school and I want to tell a different story with this character , " I think people would go with that . But the fact that people who are not connected to it and were not connected to the show or any of the mythology that was created going back to the movie which everyone kind of agreed wasn ' t a perfect version of its potential you know , I think that really confuses people . It confuses the audience . They ' re like , " How am I supposed to feel about this ? "
