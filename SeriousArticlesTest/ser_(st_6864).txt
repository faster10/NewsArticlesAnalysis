I remember one night in the ICU , the nurses got a rocker for me from the NICU and made me sit with Isabel in Ben ' s room . It was like they knew we needed time together , just the two of us . It felt very foreign to me for a very long time . I felt like her babysitter , not her mom . While I rocked her , I stared at her wondering how we were going to manage as a family and how unfair it was to her that we were putting her through so much .
