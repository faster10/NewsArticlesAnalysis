Bradley : It was kind of similar to our game plan for Charlotte Hornets guard Kemba Walker . Really , it ' s the same for all of the shooting point guards we face . Just don t leave them in the pick and roll . The bigs weren t supposed to leave until the ball was out of his hands . That s really our team defense for every point guard , though . We were trying to go out there and try to make every play hard on him as a team . That s what we try to do every single night ? try to take people out of their strengths .
