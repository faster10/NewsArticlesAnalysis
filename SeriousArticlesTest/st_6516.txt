Sanders ? ? ? s need is to battle . He travels across the country constantly , giving long , passionate speeches in a way that makes talking seem like a blue collar job , like Bruce Springsteen live . In August , Sanders flew coach on Southwest , carrying his own bag , to address the crowd at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena . Backstage , his wife , Jane ( he also has grandchildren , Senator Inhofe ) , tried to persuade him to wear a tie . Sanders seemed annoyed . Really , a tie ? Should we be talking about ties right now ?
