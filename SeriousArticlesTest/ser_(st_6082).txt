A radio interview on an Israeli sports talk station between Miami Heat minority owner Raanan Katz and respected international basketball journalist David Pick only fueled the speculation after Pick quoted Katz as saying James " made it clear that he wanted to dump head coach Erik Spoelstra " when he was in Miami . Katz later denied making the claim , telling the Miami Herald " nothing was correct " in the translation of his interview from Hebrew to English , which appeared on Bleacher Report . Furthermore , a Heat spokesman told the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Tuesday that James never attempted to have Spoelstra fired .
