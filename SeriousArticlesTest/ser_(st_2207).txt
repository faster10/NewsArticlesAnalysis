On the last day of the 1992 Clinton Gore campaign , we had the media A Team traveling with us . So I made it my business to sit next to David Gergen , then with U . S . News World Report but a former top aide to Presidents Nixon , Ford and Reagan ( at that point little did I know he would soon be working for President Clinton ) . I had never seen a communications shop as effective as Reagan ' s , and I wasn ' t going to miss an opportunity to learn from a master . Gergen told me an anecdote I still remember vividly .
