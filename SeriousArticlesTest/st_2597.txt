And between West ' s Twitter feud with Wiz Khalifa last week , Amber ' s clapback ? insinuating West likes assplay , and the ongoing saga of Blac Chyna and Rob Kardashian , it ' s becoming more and more impossible to know if this is all a strategic hot mess or if it ' s the real deal . As for the selfie : Call it a publicity stunt . Call it damage control . Call it what you want , but regardless , it ' s kind of brilliant . ?
