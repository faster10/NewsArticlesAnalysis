Audiences have just never flocked to desert set movies the way they have superhero flicks or lush adventures like Depp and Verbinski ' s Pirates franchise . Recently , western blockbuster Cowboys and Aliens underperformed with a 36 . 5 million opening and a 100 . 2 million total against a 163 million budget . That seems like a fair comparison for The Lone Ranger though Depp ' s appeal does boost prospects considerably ( especially on the international front , where westerns often toil ) . Tracking suggests that The Lone Ranger could gallop away with about 70 million over five days , but in a marketplace stuffed with well liked releases , that sounds quite high . Debuting in about 3 , 700 theaters , The Lone Ranger could wrangle about 58 million in its first five days . For a standard Hollywood release , that result would be just fine . For a 225 million tentpole with bad reviews and limited international appeal that could spell trouble .
