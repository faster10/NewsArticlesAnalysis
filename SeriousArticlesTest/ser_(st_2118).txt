Morgenstern : I did go to Comic Con and it was amazing . There ' s quite a contrast between the Book Expo and Comic Con . I didn ' t expect the Expo to be as overwhelming as it was . I had a great time but the lines for my signing were around the entire convention center . I just never expected that sort of response . Then Comic Con was just craziness . It was a lot of people and color , and loud , it was such a sensory overload . It ' s been a lot of fun , but it was good that I had just a crazy few days and then I got to have some time off and recover .
