Murray completed his 6 3 , 7 5 , 6 3 victory with the best shot of the weekend , looping a backhand lob over Goffin ' s head and under the low hanging girders , before he then collapsed on to the clay . It was a bench clearing moment , with Murray ' s teammates and all the British coaches and support staff rushing on to join him . " I can ' t believe it , " Murray said . " I always play my best tennis when I play for my country . "
