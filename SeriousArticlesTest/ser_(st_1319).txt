Presidents are loath to publicly criticize the Secret Service for fear of straining any relations with the agents who keep them alive and protect their loved ones . So perhaps it was left to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , who told reporters in Nevada on Wednesday , " I am just so disappointed in what I ' ve seen . I can ' t imagine being a father of two girls and seeing this happen in my home . I ' ll bet Michelle is just beside herself they are so protective of those two girls . So I can ' t be a cheerleader of the Secret Service today . "
