Vermont Senate President Pro Tem Peter Shumlin was quoted in the statement as saying , " The struggle for equal rights is never easy . I was proud to be president of the Senate nine years ago when Vermont created civil unions . Today we have overridden the governor ' s veto . I have never felt more proud of Vermont as we become the first state in the country to enact marriage equality , not as the result of a court order , but because it is the right thing to do . "
