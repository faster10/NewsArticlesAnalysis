So I started going to a few vinyasa flow and power flow classes in Los Angeles . There was music at some of them , and it was really physically challenging . It just kept calling me back . I didn ' t dread it like , " Oh , no , I ' ve got to go the gym tomorrow . " I know people who love the gym , and they go , and it ' s a great thing for them . That was just never my experience , but with yoga , I was excited about it , and I just kept on doing it .
