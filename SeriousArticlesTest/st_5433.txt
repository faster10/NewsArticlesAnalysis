Depending on where you live , this kind of surveillance may happen a lot . According to the ACLU , " Many law enforcement agencies track cell phones quite frequently . For example , based on invoices from cell phone companies , it appears that Raleigh , N . C . , tracks hundreds of cell phones a year . The practice is so common that cell phone companies have manuals for police explaining what data the companies store , how much they charge police to access that data , and what officers need to do to get it .
