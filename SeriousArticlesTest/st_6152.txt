My heart is full of gold because of the family I ve grown to know , the Mizzou family , former Mizzou star L Damian Washington posted on several social media sites . Y all accepted me for who I was because you all saw the man that I had the potential to be . . GP , you re the best thing to ever happen to Missouri . Thanks for giving me an opportunity to be part of the family . I guess they better start building the statue now .
