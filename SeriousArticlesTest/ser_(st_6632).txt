Every GOP presidential candidate has pledged to support Trump if he s the nominee . No one has changed that view , despite their condemnation of his remarks . I asked a strategist for one of Trump s rivals why that person s boss , after heaping so much condemnation on Trump , didn t announce a refusal to support Trump s nomination . ? What s to be gained from saying it ? the adviser asked . In other words , there would be no political gain to be made by going that far . Sure , there is a moral case to make that would be amplified by refusing to support Trump if he were the nominee , but the calculation is that in the GOP primary , that would cost too much with voters . But if the political risk of responding to Trump doesn t embolden them to do anything beside pull out the thesaurus , then voters are apt to think that the underlying offense can t really be that great . ?
