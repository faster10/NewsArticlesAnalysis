( On how critical the 86 yard touchdown drive was for the Panthers early in the game : ) Yeah , I think if you look back , I think we had 11 offensive plays when it was 31 0 . I don t even know how that could happen , but it did . Every opportunity that we had was crucial . Any one of them . The great play that they make on third and long on the touchdown pass to Greg Olsen was a huge play that they turned out . And that s the winning margin even , so any of those drives , any one of those opportunities , they re all huge . You pointed out one of them , we could have stopped them on third down which we didn t , we could have kept the ball longer so that they didn t get it , so that s pretty clear .
