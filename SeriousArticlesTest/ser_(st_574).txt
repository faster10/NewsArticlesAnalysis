This category was also bizarrely split up , this time between the main debate and the kids ' table debate . The bar for inclusion on the main stage was seemingly designed to be an arbitrary split among a group of candidates whose polling is almost completely identical . The current polling difference between all five of these candidates is only a total of 0 . 8 percent , after all . That ' s a pretty tight range . So why split them up ? All five of these candidates should have been relegated to the undercard ( after booting Jindal and Santorum out completely , to make some room ) .
