That really was the point at which it couldn ' t get any worse . It wasn ' t just people singing on the terrace , it was a colleague an international colleague humiliating you in front of all those people , an international audience . He will maintain to this day that it was just a laugh but that is exactly the point . If you look at anything like this , whether it is racism or homophobia or whatever , as if it is just a laugh that can be a very serious issue . I ' m all for a good laugh but when you offend someone and you are damaging relationships then it goes way beyond being a laugh and you can ' t hide behind that as an excuse . Does homophobia in soccer exist ? Have your say
