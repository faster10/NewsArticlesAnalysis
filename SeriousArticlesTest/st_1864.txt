The Vikings offense basically revolves around Adrian Peterson and Peterson only had 18 yards against Seattle , which tells you all you need to know about how the game went . The 18 rushing yards marked the third lowest total of Peterson ' s career . Not surprisingly , the Vikings are 1 7 in Peterson ' s career when he rushes for less than 30 yards . Peterson wasn ' t the reason Minnesota loss though , the Vikings defense was also ugly . Peterson never got a chance to get going either , the Vikings only gave him five carries in the first half before the game turned into a blowout . The 31 point loss was Minnesota ' s worst since 1984 .
