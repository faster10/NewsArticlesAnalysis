Among its many connotations , for instance , Black Star is the rap duo of Talib Kweli and Mos Def , with whom Bowie shared a rich , frank conversation about the downsides of fashion and fame for Complex in 2003 . And the crucified scarecrows in the Blackstar video also put me in mind of Michael Jackson ( who of course played the Scarecrow in The Wiz ) , an extreme instance of black stardom as both plenitude and pain . And then there was the thought of Kendrick Lamar himself , and the struggles he depicts on Butterfly . ?
