Goodacre : Actually , the copy we saw in the show dates from the fifth century . It is currently located in Berlin , Germany . Although it ' s our most complete manuscript , it is missing several pages . There are two other fragments of the Gospel of Mary , both in Greek , and both dating from the third century . It is difficult to date the Gospel itself . One of the difficulties is that there are no references to it at all in antiquity . Our best guess is that it was written at some point in the middle to late second century .
