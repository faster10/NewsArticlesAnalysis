Will receiver Danny Amendola and linebacker Jerod Mayo return on reduced contracts ? Similar to Wilfork at this time last year , Amendola and Mayo have contracts that make it highly unlikely they will return unless the sides reach some type of agreement on an adjustment . Amendola has spoken about his appreciation of playing in New England , and how money isn t a primary factor for him . Meanwhile , Mayo has been a longtime team leader whose on field role diminished in 2015 as he kept mostly a low profile from a media perspective . Is there a role for him on the team in 16 ?
