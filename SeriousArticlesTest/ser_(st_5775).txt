The Republican Party was so incensed at CNBC ' s behavior that on Friday ? it ? cancelled a future debate that was sponsored by NBC . This was not done because the party itself was under fire from candidates for their handling of the event , and it was not because CNBC is relatively impotent , and it was not because the Republican base hates the media and this could be a good way for the also disliked party to make good with its voters . It was not because of those reasons ! It was because the CNBC people were so bad , is why .
