If Fiorina s claim , ? that every time ? every single time ! ? the government gets involved in something it gets worse , ? then clearly the government should get out of the business of making war , right ? It sounds like a good idea , because government involvement in making war will only make the ability for the U . S . to wage war worse . And without the ? half a trillion dollars ? the government spends on war each year , we d probably have ? a lot fewer wars .
