Why , then , do Americans love their guns ? I will make a bold suggestion . In a country where Americans sense , quite genuinely , that their freedoms have been taken away by the government as in the U . S . Patriot Act , as in NSA surveillance people feel powerless . It makes you feel more powerful if you can enhance your personal strength with a gun . There is the romance of the Old West , too , which reinforces this idea . It ' s " High Noon " all the time in America .
