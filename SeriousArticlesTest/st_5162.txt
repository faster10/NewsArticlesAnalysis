Curry doesn ' t just have the green light to shoot ? he ' s on the freeway . But by saying " our team , " it allows the best player ( Curry ) to be a role player , just like the other players . His role is to simply take more shots and score more points . Saying our team avoids devaluing the role of an assist man , a rebounder , a defender or even a practice player . The superstar understands " our team " ? needs everyone to contribute .
