For Russia , the Minsk agreement is a dead end . The fact is that it should be for the United States as well . Making Russia stick to this agreement , despite its uselessness in achieving any path to settlement in the conflict , is a negotiating position that is unrealistic and has run its course . The pressure of sanctions is insufficient to coerce Russia away from using force , meaning that instead of a diplomatic victory , the West is witnessing Ukraine cede more territory to the separatists . Another defeat will shake its political system as well .
