There needs to be more diversity within the Oscars . I can ' t blame the Academy so much as I can blame . . . everybody holds some accountability . It ' s the Academy , it ' s the gatekeepers in Hollywood We don ' t get the budgets . We don ' t get the opportunities to film those big luxurious films that you get 120 days to shoot . We don ' t have those types of budgets , so some of it is Hollywood But you have to place the onus on yourself to understand that in Hollywood you don ' t knock on the door and ask to get in . My brother taught me you kick that door off the hinges and you make your way in We all step up and start making more movies of that cloth and then the audience , you guys come out and you support these movies . This way we have a shot at doing it . ?
