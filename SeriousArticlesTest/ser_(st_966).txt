While NCAA rules allow college athletes to trademark their names or slogans , they are prevented from collecting royalties until their playing days are over ? precisely when those marks are likely to lose value . Swinney , meanwhile , trademarked his own name in 2009 , after Clemson named him head coach and is also a vocal opponent of paying college athletes . As far as playing players , professionalizing college athletics , that s where you lose me , Swinney has said . I ll go do something else . Because there s enough entitlement in this world as it is . ( These comments earned Swinney special scorn from HBO host John Oliver during his takedown of the NCAA last March . )
