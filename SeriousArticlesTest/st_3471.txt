Rick Neuheisel , former Colorado , Washington , UCLA coach CBS Sports Network analyst : " Alabama has to pick their poison . Looking at their numbers and what they do , they ' re going to say , ' We ' re taking away Deshaun Watson ' s legs . ' They have to . All you have to do is go back and look at Auburn 2013 , 2014 in the Iron Bowl . In 2013 they ran for 296 yards . . . The next year , they limited that . It was down to like 170 actually 227 . But Auburn threw for 312 yards . They lost the game . . . they gave up 55 points . But ultimately that is what Deshaun Watson has to do throw . They ' re going to take away his legs .
