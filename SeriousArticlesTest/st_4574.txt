Perhaps worst of all are the attacks that have emanated from Debbie Wasserman Schultz , chairwoman of the Democratic Party who said that Nikki Haley was picked to give the GOP ' s response to President Obama ' s State of the Union address because the party has a " diversity problem . " What Schultz was really saying was that Haley ' s accomplishments don ' t matter . She ' s only giving the speech because she ' s a woman . That ' s an offensive comment especially for a widely respected Republican governor who will likely be the GOP ' s Vice Presidential nominee . To say that Haley , who is a self made woman , a strong conservative leader , and was elected to be Governor of South Carolina twice , only got to where she was because she ' s a woman is itself sexist . It implies a deep disrespect for another woman . Schultz , considered a long term Clinton ally , was willing to use sexism to accomplish her own political ends .
