For a while I explained this sentiment thusly : Trump may not be personally anti Semitic , but anti Semites sure seem to ? love Trump . After all , I ve received countless emails attacking me for being Jewish when I ve written articles criticizing the Republican frontrunner even though none of those pieces actually identified my religion ( for more on that , click here ) . Even though this didn t prove that Trump was himself an anti Semite , it certainly reflected the inherent bigotry that he stirs up in his supporters .
