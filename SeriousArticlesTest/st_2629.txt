' What I love the most is playing with Argentina , ' said Di Maria . ' I received a letter at 11am from Real Madrid , on the day of the game while I was in physio , trying to be the best I could be for the final , telling me to not play in the World Cup final . I was thinking about playing in the final , although I knew that if I did there was a 90percent chance I ' d re injure myself . When I read it , I ripped up the letter . I suffered a lot that morning . That was the worst thing to ever happen in my life . I didn ' t speak to anyone at the club about this . It doesn ' t matter . In the end , it was Sabella who made the decision and it was for the best . '
