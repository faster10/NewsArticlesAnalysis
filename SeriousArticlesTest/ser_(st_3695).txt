They first went out on a high in 2011 , riding the wave of critical success that buoyed 2010 album This Is Happening . It wasn t sustainable . For anybody , Murphy said of the band , in a July 2012 interview with the Hollywood Reporter . It was living a life that nobody would live forever . Bowing out at the top of their game felt like an honest decision , proving the band wouldn t compromise their legacy and record more music when it no longer felt right to do so , when they weren t at their peak . But with this return , it looks as if Murphy s forgotten the prospect of forever that faced him four years ago . Tshepo Mokoena
