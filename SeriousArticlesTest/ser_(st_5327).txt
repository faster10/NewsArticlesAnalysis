Professor Trelawney , probably better known as Emma Thompson , said her tribute was " so hard " to write because she recently kissed him goodbye . She also co starred with him in Love Actually . " What I remember most in this painful leave taking is his humour , intelligence , wisdom and kindness , " she wrote . " His capacity to fell you with a look or lift you with a word . The intransigence made him the great artist he was ? his ineffable and cynical wit , the clarity with which he saw most things , including me , and the fact that he never spared me the view . I learned a lot from him . "
