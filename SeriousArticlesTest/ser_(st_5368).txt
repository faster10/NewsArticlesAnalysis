For Cameron s relations with other EU leaders , and with the EU itself , the Paris attacks will have profound implications . On Saturday , the prime minister stressed that the UK would be working with France in every way it can . Your pain is our pain . Your fight is our fight , he said . Working together would be crucial . As was the case during the Greek economic crisis earlier this year , which posed an existential threat to the euro , Cameron s efforts to drag European leaders round a negotiating table to tinker with the EU treaties , in order to appease his Eurosceptics , will suddenly all seem rather parochial , rather trivial . President Hollande or the German chancellor , Angela Merkel , will not be focusing too much on all that for some time to come .
