Two big questions linger for the 49ers as they get ready to host the Falcons next week at home : One , Will Kaepernick last past the bye week as the starting QB ? If the team is going to make a move , that s the time to do it in order to give Blaine Gabbert the extra week of preparation . Two , will Tomsula last past the bye week as the head coach ? Yes , the team is really bereft of talent and depth , and the injuries have made it worse . Both those things aren t the fault of the head coach , but the 49ers have lost their six games by an average of almost three TDs each . Generally , they re not a competitive team that does fall on the head coach .
