But who I REALLY want to applaud are some other actors , directors and producers who were at the top of their game this year . A list that includes , but is not limited to , Idris Elba , Michael B . Jordan , Will Smith , John Boyega , Gugu Mbatha Raw , Tessa Thompson , Audra McDonald , Adepero Oduye , Samuel L . Jackson , Oshea Jackson Jr , Jason Mitchell , Corey Hawkins , F . Gary Gray and Ryan Coogler . Yes , they made us laugh . Yes , they made us cry . Yes , they made us angry . Yes , they made us think . Yes , they are all black . No , not one was nominated for the movie industry ' s highest honor . I also give extra special props ( and I can understand if you think this comes with a little bias ) to a team that I think was egregiously overlooked by The Academy ? Ice Cube , Dr Dre , F . Gary Gray and Scott Bernstein what you did was incredible . Many people have no idea about the YEARS that you labored to bring an incredibly challenging and complicated biopic to the big screen . Most have no idea of ALL the seemingly insurmountable obstacles that you had to navigate to make Straight Outta Compton a reality . But I ' m not giving you props for that . I know firsthand how incredibly difficult ( and what a small MIRACLE ) it is for EVERY single movie to get made . No , you get major props because you overcame those odds AND . . . the movie was GREAT . It was absolutely freaking EXCELLENT . Without a doubt one of the BEST producural efforts of the year . Even though I ' m definitely disappointed that The Academy voters did not see it so , I take great solace in knowing that that ' s not why you made the movie . The impact is undeniable and your legacies are cemented . Congratulations .
