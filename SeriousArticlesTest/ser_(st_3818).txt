" This nation is an apology factory . People are held up to impossible standards , or even possible ones , and fail to live up to them , as people will , and then the apology machine goes into action and will not shut down again until it runs its course , or is denied of fuel . You are simply giving it more fuel . . . . I hope I ' m not too late . You ' re scheduled to apologize again this morning . Perhaps you won ' t get this advice until it ' s too late . If so , you know what ? It ' s still good . You can ' t unapologize now . But let that be it , forever . Answer no more questions . Say you ' re sorry , if necessary , to the one person to whom you genuinely owe an apology . No , it ' s not Barbara Walters . "
