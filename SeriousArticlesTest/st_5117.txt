The Senate bill addresses an annual shortfall by increasing the cap on U visas from 10 , 000 to 15 , 000 for each of the next eight years . This is not a net gain in allotted U visas , but is a recapture of about 34 , 000 of roughly 74 , 000 U visas that were authorized by Congress but never used . From 2001 to 2007 , thousands of applicants were granted interim relief , rather than the U visas allotted for those years , while they waited for Department of Homeland Security to adjudicate their cases . The House bill keeps the cap at 10 , 000 and imposes restrictions that will make it impossible to investigate , solve and prosecute crimes when the victim is an immigrant .
