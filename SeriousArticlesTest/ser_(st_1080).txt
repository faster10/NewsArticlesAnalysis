Stones as metaphor . The Stones embody a time when rock ' n ' roll wasn ' t just " outlaw " culture it propelled the culture . That ' s no longer the case , as a recent conversation with a teenage music fan confirmed to me . An avid pop lover , she doesn ' t listen to any " rock " ( that is , music made by men or women who play guitars ) . For her , EDM which used to be called techno or electronica is the new rock Its big beats , drug allusions , and the way its bombastic thump offends anyone over 40 ( or anyone who prefers traditional verse chorus pop songs ) make it the modern day version of rock .
