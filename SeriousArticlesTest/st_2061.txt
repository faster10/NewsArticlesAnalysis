For the majority of my 31 ties I had a brilliant No 1 in Buster , Hutchins said , in an interview with The Telegraph s Tennis Podcast . He started his Davis Cup career by refusing to play under me , but in the end he came around . He loved the team spirit but he was a real enigma from the personality point of view , and his politics were never far away . Once he even wrote a letter to Margaret Thatcher to sound off about something and signed off as the British Davis Cup team . But when he and John Lloyd were together , they were probably the two most amusing people I ve ever been around . They got up to all sorts of tricks without me knowing I m sure .
