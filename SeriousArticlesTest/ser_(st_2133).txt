I began opening every closet in my home , searching the pantry for something that I could pass off as a gift from an enchanted forest warehouse . I found a few mini candy canes , but no , the tooth fairy would clearly be non denominational . Maybe I could make sandwiches shaped like hearts and keep them in the fridge no , the present is supposed to be under their pillow . Shaved turkey slices on whole wheat have no place in a child ' s bedding even I know that .
