Moss : One of the interesting things about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist is that John doesn ' t lay down his tools and follow Jesus after he baptizes him . Nor , it seems , did John ' s disciples . They had separate ministries and , while there may have been contact between the two groups , they were also de facto competitors in the ancient religious marketplace . There are some hints in the New Testament that Jesus and his followers had to differentiate themselves from John by stating that Jesus ' baptism was better ( Acts 11 : 6 ) and countering the idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead ( Matthew 14 : 2 ) Some scholars argue that these references are evidence of tension between followers of Jesus and followers of John .
