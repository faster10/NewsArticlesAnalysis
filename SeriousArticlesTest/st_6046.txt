" Right now they are nine and six . They are great kids , I love them . I want them to listen a little better , I want them to do their homework and not give me a hard time and do what I say . I ' m taking it in small steps , but I ' m not sure they are going to be into tennis . I got them doing tennis lessons every week , and I have them doing golf lessons every weekend , just to try keep them active , get them out of the house .
