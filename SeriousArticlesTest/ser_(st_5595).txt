The Charlie Hebdo attack was a game changer too . A concise slaughter and a systematic and successful assault on our weakest parts ( all our best parts are weak ? it s one of the things I like most about us ) . It was dismaying and almost absurd , as though Ian Hislop had been taken out by helicopter gunships or artillery strikes . The world seemed to reel . The world was quite right . When the politically or religiously dismayed decide it s time to wade , guns blazing , into the supergeek underworld of leftwing satirical weeklies , that s something that changes the very laws of physics .
