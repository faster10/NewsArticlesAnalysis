Although my friends on the East Coast like to think they have it easier with more options for public transportation , it ' s a mistake for people to assume that higher gas prices don ' t affect them . It ' s not about geography . We ' re all in this together . Have you noticed the price of groceries lately , as those companies that operate delivery trucks have to spend more to stack food on supermarket shelves ? So you don ' t own a car . Maybe you take the subway to work . Swell . But if you have a mouth , and occasionally like to fill it with food , high gas prices should be hard to swallow .
