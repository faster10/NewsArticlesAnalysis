Marco Rubio is the clear winner here , as his poll average went up a solid three points , from 8 . 8 percent to 11 . 8 percent . Rubio is now polling steadily above 10 percent , a feat few Republicans have managed throughout this campaign . He got a big bounce out of the third debate , after besting Jeb Bush on stage . He is now positioned as the top candidate to reap the aftermath , should the two no experience frontrunners ever actually collapse . As such , he ' s now drawing a lot more heat from the other candidates , so he ' ll probably have a pretty big target on him in the upcoming debate .
