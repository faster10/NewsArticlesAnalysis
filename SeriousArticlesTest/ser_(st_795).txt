And Obama s actually the starting point . It s Obama s radicalism that actually begins the process which creates a scenario where somebody like Donald Trump charges in to fill an absolutely , impossibly huge vacuum . Now , we knew who Obama was ? well , I did ? from even before he was inaugurated . I don t know how many Republicans looked , or today even look at Obama as a radical anything . Many of them just see him as the latest Democrat . But he is far more than that . He is the most radical leftist that has been elected president , that has even gotten close to it . And because Obama was not stopped , because the Republican Party laid down ? I m telling , folks , Donald Trump would not have exploded . Donald Trump would not have thought to even do any of this , nor would any other outsider .
