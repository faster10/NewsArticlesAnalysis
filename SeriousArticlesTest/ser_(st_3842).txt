So , the simplified argument goes like something like this the Higgs particle pervades space roughly uniformly , with a relatively high mass about 126 times that of the proton ( a basic building block of atoms ) . Theoretical physicists noted even before the Higgs discovery that its relatively high mass would mean lower energy states exist . Just as gravity makes a ball roll downhill , to the lowest point , so the universe ( or any system ) tends toward its lowest energy state . If the present universe could one day transition to that lower energy state , then it is unstable now and the transition to a new state would destroy all the particles that exist today .
