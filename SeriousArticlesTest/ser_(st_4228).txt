Furst : It ' s in every book . The bullet hole in the mirror next to table 14 . It ' s fiction . It ' s not true . Now there is a brasserie where I say the Brasserie Heininger is in the books . It ' s called Brasserie Bowfinger , but it looks nothing like the brasserie I describe in the books . Many readers have figured out where it is , and they go there and ask for table 14 and make the ma tre d ' mad because there is no table 14 , there is no mirror and there ' s no bullet hole .
