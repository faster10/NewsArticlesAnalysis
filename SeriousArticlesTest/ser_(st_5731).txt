They were warm and friendly , and some had the cocoa black skin of my mom , and our family ' s curly hair . They didn ' t talk about embargoes or Cubans in Miami or about Fidel Castro . They wondered how much rock stars made , whether I ' d traveled anywhere fun , if I wanted a ride , a meal , a cigarette or a chance to spend time on the Malecon sipping rum . It was my birthday and I felt very much at home .
