When the Dean of Tween isn ' t inviting guys to meet her in the pouring rain , she ' s courting danger any other way she can , just for the drama of it all . Her new album is called " Red " as in red light or red alert and it finds her singing about walking directly into traffic , wading into quicksand , and flirting with the kinds of jerks Kanye West might toast to . ' ' You look like bad news , ' ' she purrs on ' ' 22 . ' ' ' ' I gotta have you . ' ' One gets the feeling that it ' s not this guy ' s love she ' s after . She ' s just using him for the breakup songs .
