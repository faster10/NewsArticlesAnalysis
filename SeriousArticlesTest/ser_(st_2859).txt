What happens to a child bride from one of these countries ? If she can ' t use contraceptives , she gets pregnant , leaves school and probably never goes back . If she continues having children one after the next " one on the back and one in the belly , " as women have said to me her health will deteriorate , along with the health of her babies . By the time her children are school age , they are likely to be malnourished and stunted , so even if they go to school , they won ' t be ready to learn . Unfortunately , there ' s a real probability that this very same cycle will start again .
