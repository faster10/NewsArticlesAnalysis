" The XFINITY Series is completely necessary , " Jones said . " I have no problem with running a year , as long as I need be there . I don ' t know what the exact career path is for me down the road , and at some point , yeah , I want to race in the Cup Series every weekend , and I feel like there ' s a plan in place for that opportunity to arise , and I ' ll just keep taking what ' s given to me every week and go out and try to win races .
