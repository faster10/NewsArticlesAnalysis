" It is with great sadness that I am compelled to deliver this message of condolence and tribute to a great man , husband , father and someone who is more than just a coach , Joe Paterno . First , on behalf of Penn State Football , we offer our sincerest condolences to the Paterno family for their loss . We also offer our condolences to the Penn State community and , in particular , to those who wore the Penn State colors , our Nittany Lion football players and alumni . Today they lost a great man , coach , mentor and , in many cases , a father figure , and we extend our deepest sympathies . The Penn State football program is one of college football ' s iconic programs because it was led by an icon in the coaching profession in Joe Paterno . There are no words to express my respect for him as a man and as a coach . To be following in his footsteps at Penn State is an honor . Our families , our football program , our university and all of college football have suffered a great loss , and we will be eternally grateful for Coach Paterno ' s immeasurable contributions . "
