Apparently savoring the effects of his political sortie , the cocky Montebourg , in a televised address from the ministry of the economy , said that he would follow into the steps of Cincinnatus , a kind of gentleman farmer Roman senator , who in 500 BC came to represent civic virtue for his modesty and restraint . Cincinnatus was also known for his beautiful curly mane , just like Arnaud Montebourg . Many observers were quick to point out that vanity , rather than political restraint , were probably what the French minister shared most with the great Roman senator .
