Claire Danes was so , so perfect as Angela Chase in " My So Called Life . " But Alicia Silverstone came very close to being given the role . Producer Marshall Herskovitz explains , " We had someone looking for us in New York and she said , ' There are two people you should see . They ' re really special . ' The first was Alicia , who was 16 and emancipated . Ed wanted her , and I said , ' This girl is absolutely beautiful , but the Angela I see shivers back and forth between being beautiful and being really I mean , Alicia , you know , this is a girl who has been told she ' s beautiful since she ' s 5 years old ! I just don ' t think Angela ' s that girl . ' Then in walks Claire Danes . And at 13 , you know : From one angle , she ' s breathtaking from another , she ' s awkward . " If Alicia had been cast , " Clueless " may not have been nearly as brilliant . But then again , " My So Called Life " might have lasted for more than a single season .
