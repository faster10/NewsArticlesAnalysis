Soon after Swinney got the head coaching job at Clemson in 2008 , his agent , Mike Brown , pushed to trademark his name . We knew it was so unique , that when he had success , people would want to leverage and use it , Brown says . ( Swinney s given name is William , but his older brother Tripp called him that boy when they were toddlers in Alabama . It sounded like Dabo and has stuck ever since . ) As Brown began the process , he discovered that a food manufacturer filed to trademark Dabo s pork rinds in 2006 . Swinney told Brown that while he was an assistant coach , he struck up a conversation with a food manufacturer on an airplane , who asked him about the origins of his name . Brown thinks the pork rinds could have been named after Swinney , but a representative for Rudolph Foods , owner of Dabo s , insists the product was named after a plant manager in Mississippi who shares Swinney s unusual moniker . I know our trademarks are good , says Mark Singleton , vice president of sales and marketing at Rudolph Foods . And coach Swinney can expect to receive a whole bunch of pork rinds .
