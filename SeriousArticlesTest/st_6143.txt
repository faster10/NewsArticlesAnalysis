" Dr King , said There comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe , nor politic , nor popular , but he must take it because conscience tells him it s right , " he wrote . " For too many years , when the Oscar nominations are revealed , my office phone rings off the hook with the media asking me my opinion about the lack of African Americans and this year was no different . For once ( maybe ) , I would like the media to ask all the white nominees and studio heads how they feel about another all white ballot . If someone has addressed this and I missed it then I stand mistaken . "
