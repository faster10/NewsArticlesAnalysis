As a member of the Senate Veterans ' Affairs Committee , I have questioned VA Secretary Bob McDonald and other VA officials for months in hearings , personal meetings , phone calls and correspondence about the VA ' s flawed interpretation of the 40 mile rule and what can be done to fix the problem . Congress specifically included language in the Choice Act that gives the VA the authority and flexibility it needs to provide veterans with access to care outside the VA when the care needed by a veteran is " either unavailable or not cost effective to provide at a VA facility . " But for some reason , the VA refuses to use the authority Congress gave it and put the best interest of veterans first .
