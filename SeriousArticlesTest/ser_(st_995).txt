Say a photojournalist and an editor want to do a story about medicine and public policy . They might reflect on a couple of these questions and attempt to show them in a journalistic investigation : How often do schizophrenic patients stop taking their meds , becoming a danger to themselves and others ? Does trouble sometimes show up like clockwork and for the same combination of reasons ? Might a schizophrenic patient with a history of violence pick fights and hurt people ? Is it time for an intervention ?
