Speaking to the BBC last week , Mark Petchey recalled one vivid low : the 1 4 defeat by India , not a country normally seen as a tennis superpower , in the autumn of 1992 . On the first day I was playing Ramesh Krishnan on what wasn t the flattest surface , and he was a touch player rather than a power player . It was challenging , especially as every time I walked to one end the crowd was like Hey Petchey , welcome to hell . I felt like I was on top , but it got too dark and I lost the fifth set the next day .
