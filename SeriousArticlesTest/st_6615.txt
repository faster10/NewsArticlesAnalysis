Beastie Boys were already old school back when they were young school , hyping an early Eighties hip hop revival on " Paul ' s Boutique " before the Eighties were even over . So it ' s no surprise that on " Hot Sauce Committee Part Two " they make no effort to accommodate or even acknowledge any of the latest hip hop trends . Instead , we get the sound of master musicians in their comfort zone , doing everything their own way . Nobody would want to hear the Beasties try anything else .
