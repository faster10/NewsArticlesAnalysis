As journalist Phil Quin wrote : All that was missing was the will . i . am backing vocals . The true voice of detached British cynicism ? in fact he s a New Zealander who has worked in Australian politics but the sensibility is similar . The pride . The emotion . The bigness ? of the ambition and the sweeping statements . Why do our politicians never talk this ? Partly it is about Britishness ? all these things make us look down embarrassedly and shuffle our feet .
