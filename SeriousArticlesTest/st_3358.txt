Whether it ' s Ted Ginn Jr . , Corey Brown , Devin Funchess , Jerricho Cotchery or whoever else , the Panthers are going to need to utilize their wide receivers in this game . The Redskins have been very good against opposing tight ends in 2015 , allowing just one touchdown , while also being solid against running backs . Their weakness ? Slowing down wide receivers . To this point in 2015 , Washington has allowed 103 receptions for 1 , 473 yards and 13 touchdowns to opponents ' wide outs . The player to most likely have a big day should be Ginn , as his speed could cause issues for the Redskins .
