In an effort to get clean , Bowie relocated to Switzerland in 1976 and eventually settled in Germany . There he teamed with Brian Eno to craft what became known as his Berlin Trilogy of albums ? 1977 s Low and Heroes , and 1979 s Lodger ? which set his dystopian obsessions against the still emerging electronic sounds that would inform the radio friendly new wave of the 80s . In the mid to late 70s Berlin was an incredible city , his friend and collaborator Giorgio Moroder tells EW . There were a lot of things happening , the nightclubs were open 24 hours . It was a great experience in Berlin for him .
