In the past three weeks , Beckham has been targeted 45 times by Eli Manning . Beckham is on pace to shatter the Giants ' all time targets record , and that ' s not neccesarily a bad thing . Despite the fact that Beckham has seen constant bracket coverage and safeties rolled over to his side , he has been very effecient on his 119 total targets he has caught 60 . 5 percent of them . With Rueben Randle failing to make an impact on the outside , Hakeem Nicks still learning the nuances of Ben McAdoo ' s offense and Dwayne Harris best served in a limited role , the Giants don ' t have any better options . The Jets are likely to be without Darrelle Revis ( concussion ) and Marcus Williams . They are thin at the position , and they don ' t have any cornerbacks who can compete with Beckham . ?
