All in all , on the economic front the new leadership has made a reasonably promising start . In the coming two years , I would expect to see pretty good progress on reform in those areas where the political economy is favorable , which is the case in the financial and monetary area , as well as on pricing and taxation of resources . On the other hand , in the areas of state owned enterprises , fiscal reform and rural land arrangements , I would expect progress to remain slower in the coming two years .
