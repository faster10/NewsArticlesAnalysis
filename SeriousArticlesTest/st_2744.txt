In comedy Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton are often held up as two ends of the discovery vision continuum . Lore is that Chaplin would monkey around on the set trying all sorts of things until something seemed right and Keaton supposedly showed up just to shoot the scene he already had in his head . I ' ve always respected Keaton so much more than Chaplin I like the idea of having an idea but I ' m sure there are Keaton outtakes . Keaton didn ' t just risk his life and break his bones he also had to work . He must have run down some dead ends .
