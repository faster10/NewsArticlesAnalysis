Right when I go off to the sideline , we always chart how many plays our drives are with the quarterbacks and coach ( Brad ) Salem was like , Hey , way to dial up a 22 play drive . And I was like , What ? I thought maybe it was like 12 or 13 . Sure , his wife and neighbors have probably exhausted of the constant shouting , but you don t get to be a legend like Blaha without a little at home broadcasting practice along the way . If somebody else makes a play , you might not even see the field again . The defensive line cornered me in a room and said that if I didn t stay , there would be an altercation , Smart said Monday . But at the end of the day I look at the bigger picture ? it led us to here . I just had to be that guy . It s only right to us . We all can do everything .
