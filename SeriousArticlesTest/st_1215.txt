Would Pique follow Fabregas back to the Premier League if United came calling ? ' I left a lot of friends at United and I was really happy there even though I did not play as much as I wanted to , ' he says . ' But I always said that I want to retire here and if it is possible I want to stay here all my career . At this moment I am not thinking about leaving . I am really happy if it is true that Manchester United want me but I want to stay . I have been a Barcelona fan since I was a kid and all I want to do is to have success here . '
