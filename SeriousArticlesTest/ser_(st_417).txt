Trump s problem with Kelly extends back to a Republican debate she moderated in August , when she pressed him on derogatory comments he has made about women , a question that , though pointed , was not outside the norm of questions typically asked at debates . Mr Trump , one of the things people love about you is you speak your mind and you don t use a politician s filter . However , that is not without its downsides , in particular , when it comes to women . You ve called women you don t like fat pigs , dogs , slobs , and disgusting animals ' she began . Your Twitter account has several disparaging comments about women s looks . You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees . Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president , and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton , who was likely to be the Democratic nominee , that you are part of the war on women ?
