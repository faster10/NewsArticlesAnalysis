Trump , though , has already proved he isn t bound by such campaign logic . Few thought he d actually declare his candidacy , and he did . Few thought he d file his financial disclosure forms , and he did . Few thought he d give up hosting his reality show to stay in the race , and he did . Regardless of whether you think Trump is crazy or crazy like a fox , we can all agree that there s a nonzero chance he s crazy enough to launch a third party run .
