That year was also the one in which Afweyne attained notoriety as the key organizer of a pirate group that conducted two high profile hijackings . Men under Afweyne ' s command captured one of the largest vessels ever hijacked the Sirius Star , a Saudi owned oil tanker the size of an aircraft carrier which was carrying 2 million barrels of oil worth 100 million , according to some estimates . Later that year Afweyne ' s group also hijacked the MV Faina , a Ukrainian vessel loaded with weaponry including tanks , anti aircraft guns and 800 tons of ammunition . At the time , it was feared that this cargo could be stolen by the hijackers and sold to criminal organizations or even terrorists but , like the Sirius Star , the vessel was eventually released after a ransom of 3 million was reportedly paid .
