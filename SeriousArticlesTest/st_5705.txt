I come from a Buddhist tradition . ? We don ' t have ' God ' and we don ' t have ' God ' to thank , said Nittaya Maphungphong of VOA s Thai Service . ? But having been in this country for so long , Thanksgiving gives me a chance to pause and reflect and to be really thankful for all of the things that I have right now ? my friends , my job , my family , my dogs . ? ? What else can I say ? " said Maphungphong .
