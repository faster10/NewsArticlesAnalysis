Iran ' s Revolutionary Guard Corps and its elite branch , the Quds force , has significantly increased their influence in various Arab nations through boots on the ground , military assistance , and Shiite proxies . Iran ' s support for militia groups across the region has exponentially increased . While one country , Iran , supports approximately 25 percent of world ' s designated terrorist groups , overwhelming majority of Iranian backed groups are in the Middle East . This follows that the IRGC and Quds forces are currently the forerunners of financing , arming , and backing militia groups in the Middle East . According to the report by the State Department , even under the Presidency of the moderate , Hassan Rouhani , " Iran ' s state sponsorship of terrorism worldwide remained undiminished " . Iran has not even begun taking serious actions against senior al Qaeda leaders who are in the Islamic Republic .
