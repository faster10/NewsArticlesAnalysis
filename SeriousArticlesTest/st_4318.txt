Romney said : " There are 47 of the people who will vote for the president no matter what . All right , there are 47 who are with him , who are dependent upon government , who believe that they are victims , who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them , who believe that they are entitled to health care , to food , to housing , to you name it . But that ' s an entitlement . And the government should give it to them . And they will vote for this president no matter what . . . . These are people who pay no income tax . "
