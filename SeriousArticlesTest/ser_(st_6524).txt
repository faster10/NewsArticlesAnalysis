Newton : Kuechly should be considered for NFL Defensive MVP . He s playing better now than he did in 2013 , when he won the award . The front seven is as good as any in the NFL for two reasons well , actually four reasons . Kawann Short and Star Lotulelei at defensive tackle , and Kuechly and Thomas Davis at linebacker . Short is playing better than any tackle in the league if he can create the pressure he s been getting , it will be tough for Palmer to step up in the pocket and make clean throws . There are no two better linebackers than Kuechly and Davis .
