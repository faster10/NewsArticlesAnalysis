Update : DeKnight says he has a new show in development at Starz that could be the successor to Spartacus . We ' re hearing the mysterious project ' s working title is Incursion . The series is described in industry circles as a " Halo like video game meets HBO ' s Band of Brothers . " The writer producer says the show isn ' t expected to be another fully immersed green screen production like Spartacus . Starz says the project is still in very early stages , but obviously we ' re looking forward to whatever DeKnight makes next .
