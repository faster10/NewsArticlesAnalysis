As a family researcher , I understand why the Gore breakup scares people . Divorces after 40 years are rare , but in 2008 , of people who reported divorcing recently , one quarter had been in marriages that had lasted two decades or more . And divorces among couples 55 or older seem to be rising moderately , even as divorce rates in general have fallen from a high of about 23 divorces per 1 , 000 married couples in 1979 to less than 17 per 1000 in 2005 .
