True , parents of boys do not have to worry about them coming home pregnant , but does that mean an unplanned pregnancy can be considered " the girl ' s problem " ? After all , a boy ' s girlfriend did not get pregnant asexually . That ' s why I ' m Tebowing day and night , hoping my 15 year old has the will to stay away from sex even though the world all around him tells him there ' s something wrong with him if he does .
