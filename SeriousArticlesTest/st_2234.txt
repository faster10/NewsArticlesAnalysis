Lynch seems like a natural fit with New England . The Patriots will move on from Jackson and Blount , and after the way they finished the year ( Brady taking hits due to lack of passing options mixed with no run game ) I think the Patriots will prioritize upgrading the position . Bill values veteran RB s , although money will likely be an issue here , but if Lynch encounters a soft market and prioritizes winning it d be a great match . The Patriots would be unstoppable with an above average running game
