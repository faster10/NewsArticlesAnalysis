Coincidental , yeah . Oddly enough , being 22 , it ' s the first year a fire has been lit under my ass not because of the documentary , just personally . I have this motivation and ambition that I didn ' t have before : " I want to go paint this painting . " The hardest part of doing anything creatively is just getting up and doing . Once I get out of bed and get into my art room , I start painting . I ' m there . And I ' m doing it .
