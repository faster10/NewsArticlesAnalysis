Taking those prospective savings into account , Friedman determined in his analysis , a single payer system could dramatically reduce health care spending . That , in turn , would make it possible to finance the Sanders plan with payroll taxes of 6 . 2 percent plus an income related premium ( basically , an income tax ) of 2 . 2 percent . That d still be a lot of money , to be sure , but Friedman concluded that it would be less than what most people pay now in combined premiums and out of pocket expenses . ? The one group consistently paying a lot more would be the wealthy , since the Sanders plan would jack up their taxes to provide additional financing .
