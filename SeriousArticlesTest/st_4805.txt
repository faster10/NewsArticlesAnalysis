Linebackers Dont a Hightower and Jamie Collins are in operable order , and that s the biggest difference from the team s Week 12 loss in the same building . Collins had missed his fourth and final game with an illness , and Hightower went down in the second quarter with a sprained MCL in his left knee that still bothers him . But Hightower has been ready to roll all week , and a source told the Herald on Friday that Collins was cleared after leaving last week s victory against the Chiefs with a back injury .
