Cool . But things got weird . Even though Bill Clinton had close ties to Wall Street ( his Treasury Secretary Bob Rubin would go on to become head of Citigroup ) and financial sector s donors ponied up plenty of cash for her 2000 New York Senate run , she claimed that the main reason bankers have flocked to her cause is ? wait for it ? because of the September 11 , 2001 attack on the World Trade Center . So I ? I represented New York , and I represented New York on 9 11 when we were attacked , she said , as the moderators from CBS gaped , gob smacked . Where were we attacked ? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is . I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild . That was good for New York . It was good for the economy , and it was a way to rebuke the terrorists who had attacked our country .
