Mark H . of Austin , Texas I will probably pay 9 . 99 for the album and download it . As for music that inspires me to crack open my wallet , there are tons of bands I would still buy an album from . However , very few of those bands are mainstream acts . The problem is corporate record companies and the music industry itself used to focus on the quality of the music rather than the sex appeal or image that the artist now poses . MTV is at fault and has been since the late 90s when they brought boy bands and other teeny bop stars into the mainstream .
