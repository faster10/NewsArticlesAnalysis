TITANS 2 . 5 VS . JAGUARS : This will sound insane , but Tennessee is our best bet of the week . Yes , the Jaguars may have two more wins than the 2 9 Titans this season , but Jacksonville is not a better football team than Tennessee . And Marcus Mariota is already a better quarterback than Blake Bortles , who won ' t have his top receiver , Allen Hurns ( concussion ) , for this game . Tennessee does not have one of the bigger home field advantages in the NFL , but the Jaguars are 4 23 in their last 27 road games . We ' ll take our chances that the Titans win by at least a field goal .
