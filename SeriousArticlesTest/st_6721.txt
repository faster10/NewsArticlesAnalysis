Which might be why about halfway through the debate , the tension of night noticeably defused . Maybe Sanders and Clinton wised up to Maddow s game maybe it was too late in the day , and too late in the campaign trail , to waste so much energy on being angry on television . Of course Clinton s farther right than Sanders come the general election , she s going to be trying to appear moderate . Of course Sanders policies will be a bit harder to enact than Clinton s he is , in his own words , literally instigating a revolution .
