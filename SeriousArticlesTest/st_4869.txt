" The Sheen scandal is a pretty stark contrast to Tiger Woods . This behavior is built into the fabric of Charlie Sheen ' s bad boy profile , unlike with Tiger where it was unexpected , " said Oltmanns . " So I think he will bounce back as long as his popularity on his show remains high . People were shocked with Tiger Woods because the behavior didn ' t fit the image . People are much less shocked with Sheen because the behavior does fit the image . "
