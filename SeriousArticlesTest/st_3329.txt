But while Trump s narcissism seems self evident ? even if , as far as we know , no doctor has ever formally diagnosed or treated him ? it s a particularly complex case of the disorder . I spent a lot of time in the mirror world of the narcissist when I was writing my 2014 book , The Narcissist Next Door , and most of the experts I spoke to and studies I read define the condition as a sort of toxic mash up of grandiosity , entitlement and lack of empathy . Trump checks those boxes almost every day ? most recently and disturbingly the lack of empathy one . You don t mock the appearance of a reporter who has a conspicuous disability if you give a fig about how the target of your ridicule will feel about your behavior .
