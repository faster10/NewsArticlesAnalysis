Finally , all of these governments will convene again in March for the UN Human Rights Council ' s 25th session in Geneva . They should take the opportunity to recommit themselves to the human rights cause by adopting a resolution renewing the mandate of the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran and allowing him to visit the country . The resolution should also set specific benchmarks for the Iranian government including the release of all prisoners of conscience , a moratorium on executions , and an end to restrictions on assembly , association , and expression . Recently developed bilateral and multilateral channels between Iran and global powers , including the European Union , its member states , and United States , should be used to advance these human rights goals .
