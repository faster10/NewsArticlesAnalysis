Thaksin ' s ouster spurred the protest movement that developed over the years into the widespread " red shirt " demonstrations that occupied upscale parts of Bangkok in 2010 . By that stage , the movement had broadened to represent other issues , including resentment at the military ' s involvement in politics and economic inequality . The crackdown by security forces on the red shirts resulted in clashes that left around 90 people dead . It has been described as the worst civil violence in Thailand ' s history , and the country remains severely scarred by the experience .
