Huckabee rattled off a series of Cruz s shifts , including on ethanol , immigration , H 1B visas , whether marriage is a state or federal issue and whether religious liberty would be a priority in his administration . I think trust comes into question when a person starts changing their views on a whole variety of issues and they do it for political expediency ? they don t do it with any explanation of conviction ? or when people change their views depending on the geography of where they happen to be , Huckabee said . If they say one thing in Manhattan and another thing in Marshalltown , Iowa , that s when you start wondering about whether you can trust them .
