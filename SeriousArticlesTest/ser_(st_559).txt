Suddenly , a few armed men emerged from the streets and approached the vehicle that Helvenston and Teague were in . They fired off shots , hitting the Blackwater men in the back of the head , the stricken men ' s bodies slumping forward in their seats . Witnesses watched the other Pajero attempting to move out of the way , but it failed to pass through the gathering crowd fast enough . Within minutes of the first attack , Zovko and Batalona were also shot . The crowd began working itself into a frenzy . Locals videotaped as a mob of men and boys began to chant and celebrate , many of them cheering , " Falluja is the graveyard of Americans . "
