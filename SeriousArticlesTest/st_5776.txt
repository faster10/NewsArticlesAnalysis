" Allowing the president to define the scope of his own appointments power would eviscerate the Constitution ' s separation of powers , " said the judges from the U . S . Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in their January 25 ruling . " An interpretation of ' the recess ' that permits the president to decide when the Senate is in recess would demolish the checks and balances inherent in the advice and consent requirement , giving the president free rein to appoint his desired nominees at any time he pleases , whether that time be a weekend , lunch , or even when the Senate is in session and he is merely displeased with its inaction . This cannot be the law . "
