" Both times I wanted us to come in , slip out of a pick and roll , and just play , " said Stevens . " Because you let the Warriors get set , they re so long , they switch things , they make it really difficult on you as you saw even in the side outs . They re very physical . And we had the ball with unique time , because all I would do is call something , get it in , and run the clock down . "
