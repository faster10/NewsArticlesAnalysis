Rather than repeating such a stale performance , we would suggest the next GOP debate open with the following : " As moderator , I ' m well aware that every candidate on the stage ( with the exception of Rand Paul , of course ) would bomb the living daylights out of terrorists everywhere , and then have the American military dance up and down on the rubble , so we ' re just going to ignore the whole subject since you ' re all pretty much in agreement instead , we ' re going to be asking questions on how your economic plans would help average families , and many other subjects relevant to the American voters . " Hey , we can always dream , right ?
