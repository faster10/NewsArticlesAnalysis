AG : I don ' t dare try to predict the future , but if the speed of development of the last ten years is of any guidance we can expect to see graphene everywhere soon . Typically it takes 40 years for a new material to move from an academic lab into a consumer product , but within less than ten years graphene has jumped from our lab into an industrial lab and now there are pilot products all over the world . Governments around the world and probably more than 100 companies are spending billions on researching these materials . So , it probably deserves the superlative of the fastest developing material as well .
