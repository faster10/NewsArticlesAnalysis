Some families who come here might prefer a cabin or condo , though , and there are certainly plenty to choose from at every price point . If you ' re coming with grown kids and want a laid back but luxurious respite or want to feel like you were one of those millionaires from a century ago , check out the 30 roomLake Placid Lodge , which was rebuilt after a fire to resemble a traditional Great House . The Lodge , however , doesn ' t welcome kids under 12 ( unless you book the entire place ) , but will pamper your dog .
