Conventional wisdom would very likely hold that the Steelers success or failure in this game hinges on whether Ben Roethlisberger will be able to play now that Michael Vick is out with a hamstring injury . But the Steelers defense and running game seem capable of keeping the team in any game , so if the third string quarterback Landry Jones winds up under center , you might want to think twice before betting against Pittsburgh . It does indeed look as if Jones will be the starter in Kansas City , even though Roethlisberger practiced during the week .
