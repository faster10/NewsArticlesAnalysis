After a deep , rich sigh and a sad shake of the head ( which was my personal reaction ) , what can one really draw from these asinine comments ? Firstly , that one can t ? and shouldn t ? expect piercing intellectual clarity on matters of race and representation from elderly , establishment actors . Also , that such comments shouldn t in any way cloud one s opinion of the pair as professionals : that Rampling does stellar , sensitive work in Andrew Haigh s 45 Years is beyond doubt .
