This government has neither informed Parliament nor the country if its consultations with the state governments , if any , on this issue have led to any consensus . There is an important issue to be resolved regarding federalism . The VAT had already curtailed the autonomous right of the state governments to levy state taxes . Now , the GST removes all rights of the state governments to raise revenue from the people . Unless all issues connected with this , i . e . , rights of the states to raise revenues to implement their priorities , are resolved , the required GST constitutional amendment may not materialise .
