SS : I ve got to ask you , because I know you know about this much more than I do : I want specifics . I know that America is , right now , backing Turkey after they shot down the plane , and they ' re saying Oh , it s okay , the oil trade with ISIS and Turkey is insignificant . I know that America is backing Qatar , I know America is backing one of the biggest Salafist nations in the world , and may I add , one of the most backward regimes in the world Saudi Arabia that is arming extremist rebels in Syria . I know that America is actually financing the Kurds , which is a good thing , in Syria , but how come the same Kurds are being bombed by America s biggest ally Turkey ? I mean , unless we sort these things out or get some answers on why this is happening , how can we all fight ISIS together ?
