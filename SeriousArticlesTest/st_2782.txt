Brady was at his peak in those years . There ' s no doubt that the Patriots would have been closer to 16 wins than 11 that season with Brady . The Steelers , who went on to win that season ' s Super Bowl , won at New England that regular season , something that doesn ' t happens with a healthy Brady . The season flipped on that one result the Patriots would have been AFC East champs and had a better seed than Pittsburgh . You ' d have a hard time convincing me that Brady and the Patriots wouldn ' t have cruised through the AFC playoffs and also beaten the Arizona Cardinals , who were 9 7 that season , in the Super Bowl .
