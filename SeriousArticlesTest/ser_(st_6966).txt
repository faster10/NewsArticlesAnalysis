You might think the prisoner release would put the Republicans in an awkward position . They ve been pushing Obama to get the Americans freed for months , and now , here they are , back home with their families . Donald Trump tried to resolve the cognitive dissonance by claiming personal credit for the release . I ve been hitting them hard , and I think I might ve had something to do with it , Trump said in a campaign stop on Saturday . ( A minute later , though , he denounced the release anyway , saying it should have happened three or four years ago . How , he didn t reveal . )
