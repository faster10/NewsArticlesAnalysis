What I don t understand is why Jeb s political operation is not going after Rubio on the issue that conservatives do actually mistrust him on : immigration . Rubio s spent the past two years furiously backing away from the comprehensive immigration reform bill he passed in the Senate and taking increasingly hardline immigration positions to make amends with the GOP s conservative base . Jeb s already given up winning the base over on immigration and is sticking by his support for comprehensive reform , but he can pick away at Rubio s immigration scab and unsubtly remind conservative voters of all the work he did to pass the Gang of Eight bill in the Senate ( a part of Rubio s past that he s desperately trying to spin and rationalize ) . Even if conservatives don t consider him a credible attack dog on immigration , Jeb can still offer himself to more moderate Republicans and the GOP establishment as a candidate who sticks to principle on an issue they care about , even in the face of political backlash .
