Zehaf Bibeau appears to have been enraged by the Canadian and Libyan governments ' refusal to grant him a passport . But three years ago , after being charged with robbery , he asked a court to send him to jail for a year to help him kick his addiction to crack cocaine . A psychiatrist said he was fit to face trial , but Zehaf Bibeau was sentenced to just one day in jail . His addiction , anxiety and extreme religiosity became a toxic combination but the only intervention appears to have been the denial of a passport .
