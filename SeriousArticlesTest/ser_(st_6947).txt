A key goal of Social Security is to ensure that workers who have contributed to the program throughout their careers enjoy decent pensions and a dignified retirement . Any change in the program to keep it solvent should assure workers with low lifetime wages that they will receive decent pensions even if they retire at today ' s early retirement age . Since these workers have not benefited from the life span improvements most of us have enjoyed , it would be unfair to expect them to work longer to qualify for a decent pension .
