Mets : Lucas Duda . A streaky slugger with a good eye when he ' s going well , the quiet Duda was given an everyday job early last season over Ike Davis in a wise evaluation by the Mets . Duda has delivered on that promise of big power , with 57 homers and 165 RBIs over the past two years . He ' s worked hard to become a better than you think fielder , and he busted out of a bad slump with a homer , two doubles and five RBIs in the NL Championship Series clincher at Wrigley Field .
