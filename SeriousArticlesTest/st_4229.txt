For me it ' s a touchstone in my books . I love the story , I repeat it every time , but in every book the characters see it differently . Nobody sees that brasserie the same way . They all have their own opinion . Sometimes it ' s important to the plot sometimes it ' s not . It ' s like the Parisian moment when a lot of things come together . The way the French and the Parisians like to enjoy themselves . There ' s no music that plays there . The music is the plates , the clatter of the forks and knives , the talk , laughter , people smoking , perfume it ' s a wonderful experience , quite different from eating other places .
