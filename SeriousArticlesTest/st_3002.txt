Bush got the worst of another exchange when one of the moderators asked about regulation of fantasy football . After joking about his own 7 0 record in his fantasy league , the former governor inveighed against recent reports of abuses by fantasy sports gambling operations , equating them to day trading without any regulation at all . He suggested the government might have to intervene . New Jersey Governor Chris Christie , a former federal prosecutor , shouted down the idea . Wait a second . We have 19 trillion in debt . We have people out of work . We have ISIS and al Qaeda attacking us , Christie said , his voice rising in incredulity . And we ' re talking about fantasy football ? Can we stop ? His put down , like Rubio ' s , was rewarded with applause . ?
