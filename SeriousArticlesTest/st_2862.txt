That combination took me to an incredibly dark place . I began having trouble breathing , and I started to hallucinate . Every time I closed my eyes it was like I entered my very own movie theater running the movie " Saw " on a loop . I would see horrific , unimaginable images of death and after two and a half days , the combination of pain and hallucinations drove me to a point where I was literally suicidal . It felt like there was no hope and , quite honestly , if I could have ended it all right at that moment I probably would have ( Sorry to disappoint some of you ) .
