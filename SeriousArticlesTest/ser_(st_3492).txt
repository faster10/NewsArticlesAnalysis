So : " Fast Furious 7 . " Paul Walker died in November with filming only half finished , although given the age we live in fans had already seen Walker on set and in character . Cutting Walker out of the film entirely would have been a costly endeavor . Less cynically , you could argue that keeping Walker in the film was the right move . It would provide closure . And after all , the " Fast " franchise was something like Walker ' s life ' s work . But that opened up all kinds of creative problems for the Fast filmmakers " particularly since everyone attached to the film been proclaiming that " Fast 7 " is an attempt at world building towards a new trilogy . ( Translation : They probably already had half sketched plans for Brian O ' Conner in Fast 10 . )
