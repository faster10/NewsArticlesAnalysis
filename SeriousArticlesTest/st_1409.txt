Sater pleaded guilty in 1998 to one count of racketeering for his role in a 40 million stock fraud scheme involving the Genovese and Bonanno crime families , according to court records . Prosecutors called the operation a pump and dump scheme , in which insiders manipulate the price of obscure stocks and then sell them to hapless investors at inflated prices . Five years earlier , a New York State court had sentenced Sater to more than a year in prison for stabbing a man in the face with a broken margarita glass .
