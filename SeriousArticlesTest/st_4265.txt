Safe schools offer essential protection for children in wartime . They can provide lifesaving information about things like avoiding land mines and preventing HIV . They can also shield children from trafficking and recruitment by armed groups . In the long term , a good education promotes peace and post conflict reconstruction , and helps young people develop the skills to build lives for themselves and prosperity for their communities . Perhaps most important , access to a safe space to study and learn provides students with a sense of normality , routine and calm amid the chaos of war .
