ROTT : Yeah . One of the victims was a 44 year old man named Garrett Swasey . He was a father of two . He worked as a campus police officer at the University of Colorado , Colorado Springs campus , which is not far from the Planned Parenthood clinic . He was one of the first police officers to respond to the attack . He had been working on campus for six years and had also served as an elder at a church in town for the past seven . The identities of the other two victims have not been released yet and aren ' t expected to be released until Monday after autopsies have been finished . We do know that they ' re both civilians , though , and were not employees of Planned Parenthood . The clinic says that all of its employees are accounted for . As for the injured , five of the nine people that were hospitalized are police officers . All nine of those people , though , are reported to be in good condition or have already been released from the hospital .
