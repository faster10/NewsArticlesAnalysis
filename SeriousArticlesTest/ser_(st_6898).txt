Most of the league s coaches will be lucky to have their current jobs by then . Coaches are never fully responsible for failures , but they ll pay for the letdown with their jobs in ways that players , general managers ( who tend to be allowed the privilege to work through a few coaches of their own before receiving the axe ) , and especially owners never will . Sure , owners will have to literally pay these ex coaches the remainder of their salary following the elimination , but with most coaches making less than the average NBA player per season that price tag is hardly a millstone . Even for notoriously stingy ownership groups .
