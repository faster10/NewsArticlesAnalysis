Here s the other potential twist : if the game is close , is there a chance for two ACC teams in the bracket ? If you stacked 12 1 Clemson next to 11 1 Oklahoma , could the Tigers win the beauty contest and stay in the playoff ? Clemson would have a better loss ( 12 1 North Carolina vs . 4 7 Texas ) , and two wins that are the equal of the Sooners best wins ( Notre Dame and Florida State vs . Baylor and TCU ) . What they wouldn t have is a conference championship , which seems to be a mystifyingly overvalued commodity .
