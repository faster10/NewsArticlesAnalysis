This Broncos team reminds me of that 2000 Ravens team , with Manning playing the role of Trent Dilfer . The Panthers defense has been excellent , but the Broncos play more of an attacking style that allows them to dictate to opponents . They led the league allowing just 1 . 38 points per drive and 22 . 5 yards per drive despite an average starting field position of the 29 . 5 yard line , the third worst in the league behind San Diego and Tampa Bay . This unit is right up there with those Ravens , Steelers and Jets defenses that owned various segments of the 2000 ' s .
