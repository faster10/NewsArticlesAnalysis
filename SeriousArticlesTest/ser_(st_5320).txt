Manning is 39 now , an old man in football years who can t shake off a frosty wind like he did in the old days . Last winter he begged the famed trainer Mackie Shilstone to give him one more season and Shilstone worked him hard just to make training camp . But the year that Shilstone delivered for him has been the worst of Manning s career . His arm has never seemed right , his passes don t zip the way they once did . He was benched the day he broke the all time record for passing yards and then he missed the next five games with plantar fasciitis . Sunday s 23 16 divisional round victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers was the first full game Manning had played since early November .
