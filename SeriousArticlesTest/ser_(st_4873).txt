I applaud Ms . Patton for her bravery . There aren ' t a lot of well educated women who would be courageous enough to completely sell out the feminist movement responsible for securing women ' s equal social , political and economic rights ( to the degree that we have them ) in favor of the 1950s ' mentality that a woman ' s worth is determined by her marital status . Also , to come out with it while her youngest son remains unmarried ? Brave . Though the " universe of women he can marry is limitless , " the universe of women who would be willing to be her daughter in law is finite .
