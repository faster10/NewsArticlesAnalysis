The back story : In the mid 1980s during the Ray Perkins era , then Alabama sports information director Wayne Atcheson added five pre Bear Bryant national titles to the Crimson Tide ' s media guide : 1925 , 1926 , 1930 , 1934 and 1941 . Alabama ' s 1982 media guide , the last season for Bryant , listed 1934 as the only pre Bryant national championship , thanks to a footnote of Alabama ' s SEC history . In the year by year results in the 1982 media guide , only Bryant ' s six national titles were listed . Once Atcheson made the changes , Alabama claimed 11 national titles .
