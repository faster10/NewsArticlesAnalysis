Ah , yes ? Fiennes , a white English actor probably best known for playing Shakespeare , in love , is portraying the most iconic black American musician in the world . The announcement is certainly deserving of a double take , but if you think about it , this issue was bound to come up sooner or later : In any serious film involving a depiction of Jackson spanning several decades ( or just covering his late 80s period from Bad on ) , the question of whether you cast a black or white actor ( or both ) to play the part seems like a legitimate thing to ponder . After all , Jackson himself embraced his ever morphing physical appearance both in life and in his music videos , and so taking creative liberties for a movie about him shouldn t seem totally out of line , right ?
