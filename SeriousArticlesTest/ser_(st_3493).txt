According to the Hollywood Reporter , the crew behind " Fast 7 " has opted to " retire " Brian O ' Conner . He will specifically not be killed off , according to the Reporter ' s sources . Universal had no comment on the report , but the rumor smells true . Given the high speed nature of Paul Walker ' s death , it probably felt like bad taste to kill a character played by Walker in a movie about cars driving very fast . Still , it ' s difficult to imagine how O ' Conner will leave the series . The franchise has a well stated commitment to Family , and " Furious 6 " reaffirmed the central tenet " sentimental , but full hearted " that the characters will die for each other , even after they ' ve ridden into several different last big score sunsets . We ' ll find out O ' Conner ' s happy fate in April 2015 .
