Even without the secrecy and the substance gaps , the inquiry would still have been unsatisfactory because of how it came to be constituted . The UK makes an enormous fuss about the rule of law , at least when we want other states to observe it . Yet the best part of eight years passed between what was described by Marina Litvinenko s counsel as an act of nuclear terrorism on British soil and any consideration of this atrocity in public in a court of law . An inquest is a judicial requirement in unusual or unexplained deaths such as this , although it can on occasion be pre empted by a criminal trial . Yet all prospect of a trial faded , without any inquest coming into view . It was only constituted after Litvinenko s widow appealed ( at her own and charitable expense ) against a decision by the Home Secretary . The inquest was then re designated a public inquiry at Sir Robert s request , so that secret evidence could be , if not publicly heard , at least admitted . ?
