' I think the frustrations of playing on a big stage and then going to a smaller one can get to him . He went last winter from Australia , with everything going well for him on fast wickets , to the Caribbean on slow ones being watched by one man and his dog . That ' s when frustrations come out . He ' s had to learn . Because of his own doing in punching that locker he ' s let in two players in Chris Jordan and Chris Woakes who are now competition for places . But Ben is one of the best young players I ' ve ever seen . It ' s hard to put that on one man ' s shoulders but if he is batting at six and bowling well , England have a very good team . '
