We recognize these facts when it comes to legal drugs . It ' s why we don ' t arrest the tens of millions of Americans who drink responsibly , but do arrest people who drive while drunk or get belligerent and start fights . Yet we waste tens of billions of dollars every year arresting Americans for marijuana or other drugs , even when they ' re not harming anyone . Then we either jam them into overcrowded jails where they take up space that could hold someone who committed a violent offense , or jam them into a treatment program where they take up limited spaces for people who really need help .
