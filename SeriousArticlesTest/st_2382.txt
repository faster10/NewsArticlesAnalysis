Last summer you told us you and Willie are planning to record an album of new material together . I ' m glad you brought that up . We talked about doing that together , but with the presence of Kris , we talked about the three of us doing it . I ' m sure if we ' re healthy and live to do it , we ' ll do it . We thought about the title : the Musketeers . You know , because there ' s the three of us . We ' ll come up with some little way of describing ourselves I guess and put it together into a show .
