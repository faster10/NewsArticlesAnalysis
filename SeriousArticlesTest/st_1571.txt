MF : I don t know what Turkey expects , I don t know what Russia expects . I know what the contributing nations of the world expect , is that those who are contributing to the greater good of stability , security , prosperity , we have to figure out how to deal with this problem , and I m not one to look back , because I can give you all the history going back many many centuries , if you want , but we have created some of these problems , and I got that . Now we have to figure out how to move forward and in order for us to not move to a greater level of conflict between the great nations of the world , we have to come to grips of how do we work together , how do we take interests , interests that are converging . So we have a whole set of converging interests that we are seeing right now , and unless we understand it , we re going to make mistakes , we re going to make tactical mistakes that are going to lead to strategic consequences .
