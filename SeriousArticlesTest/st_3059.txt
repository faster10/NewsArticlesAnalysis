I don ' t believe that inner beauty is sufficient in this cruel world . That ' s the pap one tells a child . I don ' t believe that positive thinking improves your skin tone or that loving or being loved changes the shape of your nose or restores the thickness and color of hair , but I do know that there is a way of being beautiful , even as age takes its toll , that has something to do with the spirit filling with joy , something to do with the union with another human being , with the sense of having done well at something enormously important , like making happy a man who has made you happy often enough .
