I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these protests in a number of countries . Let me state very clearly ? and I hope it is obvious ? that the United States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video . We absolutely reject its content and message . ? America s commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation . And as you know , we are home to people of all religions , many of whom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion , including , of course , millions of Muslims . And we have the greatest respect for people of faith .
