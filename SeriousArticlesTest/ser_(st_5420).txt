SIGNER : Yeah , I think that that ' s his argument . And then now if you look at the variables we have today , you have terrorism . You have economic fear . You have this idea of American decline . You have collapse of statesmanship as an ideal . We don ' t talk very much about our leaders becoming statesmen , which is one of the great ways to diffuse or attack demagogues is when you have leaders that we respect rising up against them . That ' s what happened with Joseph McCarthy . And we have a worship of celebrity , and we have kind of a festival of the appetites is what you would call these emotions that somebody like Trump plays to . And he ' s really a perfect storm of all of those things , and I think that his supporters I agree the people that he ' s playing to would think that the system that he ' s attacking is corrupt , weak , all those other things . But the problem is that he ' s now turning on the basic precepts of American constitutional democracy , freedom of religion , an open society , you know , the state having monopoly on violence . He ' s getting close to encouraging violence .
