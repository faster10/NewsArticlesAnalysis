" Technically speaking , the Nifty has now broken down marginally from its lower end of the Channel . Going forward , if the index manages to stay below 7 , 920 then we may witness an immediate correction towards 7 , 850 ? 7 , 800 levels . On the higher side , 8020 ? 8060 are likely to act as a strong resistance . It ' s advisable to stay light on positions as the election outcome on Monday may bring in higher volatility in our market , " points out a morning note from Angel Broking .
