Sanders dominates with young voters , which makes their effective exclusion from Monmouth ' s Iowa poll dubious . Since Monmouth used the same method in New Hampshire , young voters would be just as effectively cut out of that poll as well . ( Ironically , in New Hampshire that bias only resulted in a statistical tie but still , it contributes to the fanciful yet prevalent narrative that Clinton is surging and Sanders is slipping . ) It doesn ' t make sense but then again , it wasn ' t sensible that every pundit called the first debate for Clinton , while every online poll and focus group that night called it for Sanders .
