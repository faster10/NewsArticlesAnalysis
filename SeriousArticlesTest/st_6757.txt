He is from the private sector not a politician , can I get a Hallelujah ! Where , in the private sector , you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritise , to keep the main thing , the main thing , and he knows the main thing : a president is to keep us safe economically and militarily . He knows the main thing , and he knows how to lead the charge . So troops , hang in there , because help s on the way because he , better than anyone , isn t he known for being able to command , fire ? Are you ready for a commander in chief , you ready for a commander in chief who will let our warriors do their job and go kick Isis ass ? Ready for someone who will secure our borders , to secure our jobs , and to secure our homes ? Ready to make America great again , are you ready to stump for Trump ? I m here to support the next president of the United States , Donald Trump .
