The transformation begins with the comparatively unfussy acoustic guitar ballad Never Ending , with Rihanna musing on romantic dissolution and its lasting tendrils . The real revelation comes next with Love on the Brain , as she deploys her infrequently used head voice over a classic slow soul groove , which makes the downshift into her familiar husky register that much more effective . As she implores Don t you stop loving me , her performance has a grit , sweat , and weariness to it that s unusual and humanizing . Higher continues the retro theme while it feels more shrill and shouty vocally , it also feels fully engaged . Rihanna brings the proceedings to a close with a melancholy piano ballad , Close to You .
