Ten Marines in full ceremonial dress march out from the wings to the sound of trumpets and drums . They move like a synchronized machine , forming two parallel lines perpendicular to the audience . They stand 10 feet apart , staring straight ahead like statues in a deadly gauntlet . They don ' t blink they don ' t smile . They just stand there looking dangerous as hell . Then , a command is barked out . Ten swords are drawn as one , catching the light on their blades and sending it flashing through the audience like a thousand lasers . If Dr Frankenstein ' s infamous creature were in the vicinity , I suspect he ' d crap his pants .
