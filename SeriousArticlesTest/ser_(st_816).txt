The AU has already developed a number of Pan African initiatives which target strategic sectors of development and which will be key to the success of Agenda 2063 . These include the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme ( CAADP ) Boosting Intra Africa Trade ( BIAT ) the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa ( PIDA ) and the Continental Free Trade Agreement ( CFTA ) . With the AU Commission represented on the Focac platform , it will be important for it to forge synergies with Focac and the Chinese leadership as an incentive for China to become a strategic player in helping to realise the ambition of these regional and continent wide initiatives . This is particularly important if African countries are to guard against a historical planning and policy paradox where the more frameworks have been adopted , the more their outcomes and efficacy were dictated by the law of diminishing returns .
