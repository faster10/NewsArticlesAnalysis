It ' s been a few weeks since I surveyed the Republican presidential field , but recent developments seem to indicate it ' s time to take another look . Mostly this is because the mainstream media all seem to be ignoring an actual story ( even a horserace story ! ) , to instead focus on an artificial narrative imposed by Fox Business Network ( the host of tomorrow night ' s GOP debate ) . While much attention has been paid to Fox ' s reshuffling of who will appear on which debate stage , virtually nobody ' s talking about the complete collapse of Carly Fiorina ' s polling . She can ' t even now be considered a plausible Republican nominee , when not that long ago she was solidly in third place in the polls . This is a pretty major development , and it has resulted in the field of Republicans with any sort of believable shot at winning the nomination shrinking from six to only five .
