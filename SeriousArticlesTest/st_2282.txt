Regions across the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes have traditional fighting festivals and ceremonies as an outlet for this type of mountain born aggression . Rules about who fights whom and what weapons you can use ( if any ) vary from place to place , but the general gist remains the same , as does the expected goal of social catharsis and the collective venting of pent up steam . In Santo Tomas , the festival is known as Takanakuy , everybody fights everybody , and it happens bright and early Christmas morning .
