She had a good answer when Dickerson asked whether she d identify the enemy as radical Islam , as many Republicans do . We re at war with jihadism , she answered . We have to reach out to Muslim countries , they have to be part of our coalition . It s not helpful if they shortcut radical Islam to say we are against Islam . Then she said , Historically , it s important to try to understand your adversary , to understand what they are thinking , how they will act and react . Would anyone disagree with this ? It s remarkable that so few American politicians say anything of the sort , and it s very much to her credit and credibility that she did .
