" I think that ' s the only way a true artist can have a long career in music . Rock ' n ' roll is littered with unseemly and ill advised records that see their creators abandon what made them good in the first place as they chase trends and attempt to stay relevant old rockers doing drum ' n ' bass , country singers trying to be emo , and worse . Ironically those records actually make the acts in question seem less relevant as they blatantly don ' t get the trends they ' re copying . "
