The Raptors learned on Sunday that they would be without center Jonas Valanciunas ( hand ) for at least six weeks , so they predictably went with Bismack Biyombo in the starting lineup . The big man didn t have any blocks which is what he is known for and scored just six points , but he did manage to be dominate on the glass with 14 rebounds . The encouraging thing for his value is that he logged 31 minutes instead of the Raptors choosing to go small , so I think any owner in need of a low end center should pick him up . Keep in mind that he was averaging 0 . 9 blocks in 16 . 9 minutes per game prior to Sunday . Luis Scola also benefited with 20 points and eight boards in 31 minutes , but I have a hard time believing that the 35 year old veteran will be anywhere near this good on a nightly basis . ?
