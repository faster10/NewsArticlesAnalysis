That s just a start , though . The fact checking should be in every single article about Trump , not a separate feature ? and it s easy to dispute such obvious lies . As for Chuck Todd : Good job calling a spade a spade , but what is he going to do about it ? Will he be tougher on Trump than he was on Ben Carson , whose open Islamophobia he let slide ? Will he acknowledge , in every single report he does about Trump , that Trump is leading an objectively racist and authoritarian campaign ? Will other reporters ? To the Times credit , it ran a story about a Muslim community in Michigan dealing with what the paper called a tide of anti refugee , anti Muslim sentiment that has swept , angrily and inexorably , across the United States . There need to be far more stories like that .
