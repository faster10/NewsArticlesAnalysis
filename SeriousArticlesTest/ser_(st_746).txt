There can now be no question that Mr Trump is a serious contender for the Republican nomination . GOP strategists fear that his recovery from a slight dip points to a durability in support that other maverick candidates ( remember Herman Cain ? ) failed to demonstrate . Polling expert Nate Silver suggests that Mr Trump s momentum rests on less than sturdy surveys , and will probably come up short once the caucuses begin . But any complacency within the Republican Party would be deeply unwise , for if Mr Trump can continue his record of overturning the prophesies of analysts and stay ahead in Iowa and New Hampshire , the juggernaut will become very difficult to stop . ?
