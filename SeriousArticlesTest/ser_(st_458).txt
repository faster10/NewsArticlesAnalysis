The game ' s first touchdown , which came with a little more than five minutes left in the third quarter , should live for a long while on the Steelers highlight reel . Receiver Martavis Bryant fully extended up to pull down a pass in the end zone , then was spun around before completing the catch . He wound up falling forward and pinning the ball against his right hamstring . He then did a somersault and somehow held on to the ball without allowing it to touch the ground .
