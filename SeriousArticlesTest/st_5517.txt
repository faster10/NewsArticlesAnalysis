De Waal : Yeah , that ' s an act of mimicry and synchronization , which is the first form of empathy . If you talk with a sad person , you ' re going to have a sad expression on your face . You ' re going to feel sad very soon . That is the body channel of empathy . You synchronize with the other , and that female in the birthing scenario was synchronizing with the other . It ' s a very early form of empathy we call it " modes of mimicry , " when you do the same thing as somebody else . The body channel of empathy is very important to us and we rely on it every day . If you talk with people and you adopt their facial expressions , they will be laughing , you will be laughing , and so on .
