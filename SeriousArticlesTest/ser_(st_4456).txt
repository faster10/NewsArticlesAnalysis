IN 1879 , the then wildly popular Puck Magazine published a cartoon by Joseph Keppler called " The Religious Vanity Fair . " In a two page drawing , Keppler mockingly depicted " The Arcade of True Faith , " featuring a Catholic priest selling indulgences , a hook nosed Jew , a financial trickster Presbyterian , a polygamist Mormon , a mortify your body Methodist , a dotty Episcopalian priest , a rotund new age preacher pushing the " Love Road to Heaven " and other ordained and self appointed religious leaders .
