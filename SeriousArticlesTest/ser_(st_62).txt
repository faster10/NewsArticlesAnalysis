It was applied to an entire era of our history roughly a century ago , from about 1890 to about 1920 , encompassing the progressive administrations of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson ( along with sympathetic analogs in many state capitals , such as " Fighting Bob " La Follette in Wisconsin ) . There was for a time a magazine called La Follette ' s , but it eventually changed its name to The Progressive .
