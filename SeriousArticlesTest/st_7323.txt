Odell Beckham Jr . , a brilliant player who has now participated in a grand total of 22 NFL games , had this one in his hands but couldn ' t complete the catch in the end zone .

This is not , as we discussed all week , the Giants team of 2007 or 2011 , which surrounded Eli Manning with hardened champions who ' d been through tough times and knew what it took to win . This is a team , Manning excepted , that ' s still learning how to win . And learning can hurt .
