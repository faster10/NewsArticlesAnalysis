They whack Trump for espousing a free floating populism with strong man overtones and call him a huckster , while also turning over column space to Glenn Beck , the conservative movement s preeminent populist huckster . They fault Trump for his pettiness and lack of basic civility , and then invite you to read a short piece by Erick Erickson , who famously called a Supreme Court justice a goat fucking child molester . It s tough to argue that Trump has qualities that reflect poorly on conservatism when you surround yourself with people who find success within the movement because they possess those same qualities .
