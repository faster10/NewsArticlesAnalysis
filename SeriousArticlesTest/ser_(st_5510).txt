Frans de Waal : Well , the reason I chose that title is , when I bring up the origins of morality , it revolves around God , or comes from religion , and I want to address the issue that I think morality is actually older than religion . So I ' m getting into the religion question , and how important is religion for morality . I think it plays a role , but it ' s a secondary role . Instead of being the source of morality , religion came later , maybe to fortify morality .
