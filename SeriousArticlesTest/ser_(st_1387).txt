It was , according to her brother , Youssouf Ait Boulahcen , an end to a deeply troubled life . Boulahcen was not motivated in what she did by Islam in reality she had no interest in religion , he said . She was living in her own world . I never saw her open the Koran . She was permanently on her phone , looking at Facebook or WhatsApp . I told her to stop all this , but she would not listen . She ignored my numerous attempts to give her advice . She told me I was not her dad , or her husband .
