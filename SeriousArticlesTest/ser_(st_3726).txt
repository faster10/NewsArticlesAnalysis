Early into my lunch with Andrew Small , I learn quickly that a reporter s notebook doesn t always suffice when having a meal with someone who talks as quickly as he does . We meet at The Leela Palace s multi cuisine restaurant , The Qube , at Chanakyapuri , New Delhi s diplomatic enclave . Small , author of The China Pakistan Axis : Asia s New Geopolitics , had suggested the venue and I had gladly accepted , partly drawn by the prospect that if the conversation flagged my guest and I would , at least , be charmed by the manicured lawns and flower beds in front of the restaurant .
