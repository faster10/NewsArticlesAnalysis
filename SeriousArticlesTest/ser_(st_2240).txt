Estelle Irizarry , a linguistics professor at Georgetown University , has analyzed the language and syntax of hundreds of handwritten letters , diaries and documents of Columbus and concluded that the explorer ' s primary written and spoken language was Castilian Spanish . Irizarry explains that 15th century Castilian Spanish was the " Yiddish " of Spanish Jewry , known as " Ladino . " At the top left hand corner of all but one of the 13 letters written by Columbus to his son Diego contained the handwritten Hebrew letters bet hei , meaning b ' ezrat Hashem ( with God ' s help ) . Observant Jews have for centuries customarily added this blessing to their letters . No letters to outsiders bear this mark , and the one letter to Diego in which this was omitted was one meant for King Ferdinand .
