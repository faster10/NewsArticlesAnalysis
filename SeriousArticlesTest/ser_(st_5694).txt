Some of the more brooding tracks , in contrast , lend themselves to bombast . ? On Alive , another account of surviving co written by ( aha ? ) Adele , ? she yelps out the lines leading to the chorus " I ' m still breathing , I ' m still breathing " in a breaking ? rasp , then explodes ? in a fit of melisma while closing the bridge . One Million Bullets seems similarly mannered , with Sia ' s ? voice low and her vibrato slow and choppy on the verses before belting out the choruses .
