For an angry , self righteous Post it note , Sanders is pretty likable . He ? ? ? s warm , thoughtful , self aware , brave , funny , and ? ? in that way that hippies don ? ? ? t care what people think of them ? ? cool . Sitting near a provolone filled refrigerator in the cafeteria kitchen at Plymouth State University , he roughly pulls his sweater vest over his head , to look more formal , maybe , or to stay cool , or to achieve his hairstyle . He approaches his son Levi , a paralegal at Greater Boston Legal Services , who is about to introduce him onstage . He picks a huge piece of lint off his son ? ? ? s lapel and asks , ? ? ? Is this what genetics is about ? He has more crap on his suit jacket than I have on mine . ? ? ?
