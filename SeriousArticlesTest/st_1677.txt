Spectre is far from a disaster : The locations are impressive , the Bond Q relationship works wonderfully well , and the first two thirds of the movie generally go down easily enough . But by the time Spectre reaches its conclusion , the backstory has become so fraught , the motives so unclear , and the layers of scheming by the villains so convoluted that it s exhausting . Bond and Swann arrive at Waltz s lair with absolutely no plan . Their eventual escape is nicely executed , but rather than closing credits , we get another half hour in London , with an unsurprising twist , and several more plodding , fun free encounters between heroes and villains . ?
