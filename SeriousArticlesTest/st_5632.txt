When we talk about the decline of the white working class ? and in particular , the dramatic spike in alcoholism , addiction , and premature death among young and middle aged working class white men ? we re talking about states such as Maine , where slow growth and isolation have bred struggling towns where many rely on public assistance . These people ? as we ve seen in West Virginia and similar parts of Kentucky , Pennsylvania , and other states ? don t vote . And to that point , 55 percent of nonvoters are white , 51 percent are men , 54 percent are between 30 and 64 years old , and 46 percent make less than 30 , 000 a year . They are estranged from the political system .
