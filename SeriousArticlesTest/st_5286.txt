Lie prone ( belly down ) on your forearms with your elbows under your shoulders . Exhale as you press down through your forearms as though you are trying to slide your belly through your arms to create length in your low back . At the same time , move your shoulder blades down toward your waist . This will activate the mid back muscles essential for thoracic spine extension while inhibiting the muscles of your upper neck and chest that limit mobility . Hold the posture for three long , deep breaths . Rest for a breath or two and repeat for a total of three holds .
