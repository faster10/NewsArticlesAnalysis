Murray will not have forgotten what happened a year ago when he had Djokovic wobbling , having split the first two sets and gone an early break up in the third . It was at that stage that Djokovic began to clutch his ankle , seemingly in real pain and unable to move properly . Looking over the net and seeing his opponent struggling spooked Murray and though he ought to have known better ? after all , it is not the first time Djokovic has looked down and out and suddenly run around like a hare ? it got to him , he lost focus and barely won another game . As Murray said on Friday , the 2015 final is a good indicator that his tennis is good enough to be close to Djokovic and he will take heart from the fact that he beat him in Canada last summer . If he can cut down on the monologues , conserve his energy and play his best then he will give himself a chance of breaking his losing run in finals here .
