The 2014 champion Stan Wawrinka also reached the last 16 , staying on track for a blockbuster semi final against Murray . Muguruza , rated one of the few women capable of threatening champion Serena Williams , slumped out at the hands of unseeded Czech Barbora Strycova , her 6 3 6 2 loss punching a hole in the draw . With Romanian world number two Simona Halep sent packing in the opening round , seventh seed Angelique Kerber remains the top woman in the draw s lower half . But the path to a dream final against Williams seems laid out for 14th seed Azarenka .
