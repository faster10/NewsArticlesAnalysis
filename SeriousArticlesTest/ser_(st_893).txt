Albert Einstein predicted this phenomenon , called " gravitational lensing . " According to his theory , gravity bends light much as the lenses in my glasses bend incoming light rays . An image of a very distant galaxy would be undistorted and true if no other galaxies were along the path between it and the Earth . But when light passes near or through a large mass like a cluster of galaxies , which can weigh as much as 1 , 000 times our Milky Way galaxy it bends because of the gravitational force of the cluster . The more massive the cluster , the more the light path curves .
