As The New York Times recently noted , Trump is a master of demagogic rhetoric , stoking and manipulating fear while issuing sweeping but always studiously vague promises about how he and he alone is smart and tough enough to keep the country safe and fix its mountain of problems . " Something bad is happening , " " Something really dangerous is going on " : Trump uses such ominous , open ended language to talk about a range of threats : Mexican immigrants , Muslim terrorists at home and abroad , and legions of stupid people from both parties whose incompetence has supposedly led the country and its economy to the verge of collapse .
