Now , finally friends , I want you to try to picture this , it s a nice thing to picture . Exactly one year from tomorrow , former President Barack Obama . He packs up the teleprompters and the selfie sticks , and the Greek columns , and all that hopey , changey stuff and he heads on back to Chicago , where I m sure he can find some community there to organise , again . There , he can finally look up , President Obama will be able to look up , and there , over his head , he ll be able to see that shining , towering , Trump tower . Yes , Barack , he built that and that says a lot . Iowa , you say a lot , being here tonight , supporting the right man who will allow you to make America great again . God bless you ! God bless the United States of America and our next president of the United States , Donald J . Trump !
