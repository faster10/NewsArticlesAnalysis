You ' re young and healthy . You don ' t really want health insurance . No sweat . You don ' t have to buy it . You can " opt out . " But then you ' ll have to pay a fine of between 95 for every adult in your house or 1 of your income after 10 , 000 , whichever is larger . So if you ' re single and you make 50 , 000 , you ' d have to pay a 400 fine for not having health insurance . The Supreme Court called this fine a tax . You can look at it that way . Or you can view it as an upfront payment for having hospital and ambulance services able to come get you if you need them . Or you can look at it as horrible government overreach . Some people do .
