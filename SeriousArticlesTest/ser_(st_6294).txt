As for Sunday s game , Griffin got off to a shaky start due to some early foul trouble and wasn t able to score in the first half , finishing with nine points , six boards , four assists , two steals and six turnovers in 29 minutes . This was just his second bad game of the season and he is still returning second round value , so I m not concerned and you shouldn t be either . Jordan was great with 13 points , 15 boards and five blocks , but to nobody s surprise he hit just 1 of 4 from the free throw line . Even I can hit 1 of 4 from the free throw line and I probably wouldn t have made my high school JV team back in the day .
