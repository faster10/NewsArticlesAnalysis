When it comes to dirty tricks , we thought we ' d seen it all at the World Cup . From the Battle of Santiago between Italy and Chile in 1962 to Harald Schumacher ' s attempt to decapitate Patrick Battiston in 1982 , the Hand of God ( 1986 ) , the elbow of Leonardo ( 1994 ) , Zidane ' s headbutt ( 2006 ) and Nigel De Jong ' s kung fu kick ( 2010 ) , frankly we were running out of misdemeanours . Luis Suarez , take a bow .
