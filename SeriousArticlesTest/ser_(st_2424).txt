With custom made chandeliers above the cherry wood bar and jazz and swing played on the piano , Illusions gives the impression of being like any other roaring ' 20s themed jazz club . Not so on Friday and Saturday evenings , when the stage cut into the middle of the bar hosts a one hour vaudeville style magic show ( 5 cover ) . House magician Spencer Horsman escapes from a straitjacket while hanging upside down from the ceiling , a feat best appreciated while sipping a multilayered " magic " martini of Hpnotiq liqueur , Stoli raspberry vodka , pineapple juice and Chambord ( 12 ) . The low key second floor lounge has leather sofas and retro magician posters that go nicely with Magic Hat beers ( 3 ) . illusionsmagicbar . com .
