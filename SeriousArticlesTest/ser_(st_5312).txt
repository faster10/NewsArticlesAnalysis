As long as Gervais , the little gremlin on your shoulder , can whisper in your ear that what you re watching is all a bunch of rubbish , you won t feel quite so bad that you are watching a bunch of rubbish because you can play along through the magic of social media . Twitter is like the Golden Globes Hosting Home Game , which allows even the least witty among us to chime in with their 140 character zingers . You can go on Twitter to say how bad the show was , or you can go on Twitter to complain about all the people saying how bad the show was . Or you can whine about how your favourite movie or TV show was robbed . There s a whole buffet of options in the Golden Globes Home Game . It s up to you how you play .
