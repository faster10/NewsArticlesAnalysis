The central text for this project is a book called " The Israel Lobby and U . S . Foreign Policy " co authored by Profs . Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer , which argues that " the Israel lobby " maneuvered the United States into the Iraq war on Israel ' s behalf . Walt and Mearsheimer present their argument in delicate language , but it ' s the same case argued by Prof . Juan Cole of the University of Michigan , again not a crank , but a past president of the Middle East Studies Association .
