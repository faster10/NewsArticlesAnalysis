One reason to panic : Dom Capers defense continued to struggle in coverage against tight ends . Kyle Rudolph beat defensive back Micah Hyde for a 47 yard touchdown in the first quarter . In the third quarter , Rudolph beat safety Morgan Burnett for a 33 yard gain on a seam route to set up Adrian Peterson s 6 yard touchdown run . Rudolph gained more than 100 yards receiving . That s a bad sign , considering the Packers will have to deal with Bears tight end Martellus Bennett this week .
