Father Lorenzo Pasquotti of the local Catholic church , which was a shelter for hundreds of passengers the night of the accident , has also created a museum in the church that includes life jackets from the ship , hard hats , a piece of rock from the bottom of the cruise liner and a tiny vial of oil from the Concordia ' s engines , almost like a relic of blood from a saint . He also keeps a loaf of bread , meant to signify the feeding of the salvage crews , and the crucifix and communion tabernacle from inside the Concordia ' s chapel .
