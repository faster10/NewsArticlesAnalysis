The Panthers showed that they have a multitude of ways to carve up a defense . Star tight end Greg Olsen had only one catch at halftime , but ? running back Jonathan Stewart , who missed the final three games of the regular season , had his second straight strong performance . Ted Ginn Jr . had a 32 yard punt return and then , on the ensuing drive , an impressive 22 yard touchdown run after quarterback Cam Newton flipped the wide receiver the ball . And they have enough disruptive playmakers on defense to overcome injuries and some deficiencies in the secondary . Oh , by the way , Newton looked terrific Sunday in his first NFC Championship Game .
