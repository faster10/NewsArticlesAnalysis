Flatley started The Sepsis Alliance to educate others about sepsis , where he tries to walk a fine line . " You don ' t want to panic people . We all get infections and , thank God , most of them heal , " he says . " So this is what I tell people : If you ' re feeling bad all over and have a high temperature and either high or low blood pressure , those are all indications that your whole system has been infected . It could be sepsis . "
