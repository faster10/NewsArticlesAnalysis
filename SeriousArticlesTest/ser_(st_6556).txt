Everyone ' s outraged all the time . Why are you outraged ? There ' s war there ' s always been war , as long as most of us have been alive . There have always been people being abused , there ' s always been horrible things in the world . Why are we outraged ? We should just be quiet and figure it out , and work it out together . . . . There ' s no solution in Washington as long as people are shouting like that .
