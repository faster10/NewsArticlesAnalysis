My third piece of advice is that no matter how hard it may be at times , you must love your white colleagues . Continue to love the white guy in your political science class who yelled that uneducated black people should not be allowed to vote but should instead take a test to get the right to vote as if this was the Jim Crow South . Love each and every one of them even though you are not sure which one of them keeps posting " black people are dirty " on Yik Yak , or which one of them made you feel required to clean up " bye , bye porch monkey " in the stall on the second floor bathroom of the library . Love that drunk girl who made the conscious decision to go in black face to that poorly themed sorority party . Love the guys who purposefully brought you into the room displaying that large Confederate flag during Greek recruitment . Plus , you can ' t forget to love the " friend " you went abroad with who , in a drunken rage in Luxembourg , called you a n gger , making you so ashamed of yourself that even to this day you haven ' t told your mother .
