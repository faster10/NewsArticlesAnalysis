Last week , a post on the page said : " We are patiently waiting for more information on the case and have faith in the Montreal Police . . . Members of this group have spent over a year searching for this individual , who we believe is also responsible for several videos where animals were killed . Information gathered by group members was passed on to the authorities in Canada , and we were informed that they were actively working on locating the person seen in the videos hurting animals . "
