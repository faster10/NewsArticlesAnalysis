I can t believe all the bitterness by people over the Patriots . Seems every year they are in the AFC Title game . In the era of free agency and NFL parity the Patriots defy the odds . The Patriots had to work miracles with their OL all this season . Injuries yes they had more than any other team . So I suggest all the critics to read Teddy Rosevelt s The Man in the Arena . Years from now people will marvel at what the Patriots accomplished .
