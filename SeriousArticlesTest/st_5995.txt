In the first research to emerge from LOFAR , to be published this month , scientists say that the telescope will lead to a tenfold leap in new discoveries of pulsars the peculiar stars whose highly regular spin can be used as a kind of clock , and effectively , as a test of Einstein ' s theory of general relativity . By observing pulsars as they beam toward Earth from different directions , astronomers are able to detect minute differences as the signals arrive , caused by the gravity waves that Einstein predicted would distort space time in different directions . If gravity waves are real , one of these " clocks " would seem to be running slowly .
