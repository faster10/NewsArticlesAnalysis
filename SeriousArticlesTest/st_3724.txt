AG : Because of its range of extraordinary properties , people are considering using graphene in a myriad of different applications . For example , because graphene is so strong , people want to use it to reinforce plastics , making them conductive at the same time . Because it ' s transparent and conducts electricity , people want to use it in applications like mobile phone screens , touch screens , TV screens and so on . People are also considering using it to go beyond silicon technology and make our integrated circuits even denser and speedier . Those are just few examples .
