I remember walking home from the store one day , back when I was Trayvon ' s age . A white man in a sedan pulled up beside me , rolled down his window and said he wanted to talk . I was always taught to never talk to strangers , so I stayed silent and walked faster . He drove faster . I ran , yelling " Help ! " as I tried to get away from him . That ' s when he pulled over , got out of his car , drew his weapon and yelled he was going to shoot me if I didn ' t stop running .
