Presenters include everyone s boyfriend Channing Tatum , Bryce Dallas Howard a . k . a . not Jessica Chastain and frequent butt of Ricky Gervais jokes Mel Gibson . The list of presenters this year includes several past Globe winners ? Amy Adams , Patricia Arquette , Jamie Foxx and Eddie Redmayne , to name just a few ? and a certain dancer turned wrestler turned Tarantino star . But the name that s been generating the most buzz is Mel Gibson , who has not only been the recipient of more than a few of Gervais burns , but who has also kept a relatively low profile since a string of anti Semitic comments and a volatile relationship with his ex girlfriend landed him a load of negative press . Don t be surprised if Gibson is called upon to reprise , in some way , his first major role , as Max in George Miller s 1979 movie Mad Max ? the forebear to this year s wildly popular and critically lauded action flick Mad Max : Fury Road .
