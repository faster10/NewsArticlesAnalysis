No , this is not feminists censoring the Internet . We are only demanding that Facebook apply its existing content policy rules to women fairly . The fact is , the threat of violence silences women every day on and offline . For example , content considered worthy of removal at Facebook for being unsafe must threaten " imminent harm . " " Imminent harm " is a luxury for women who experience rape and domestic violence as pervasive threats . The notion of imminent harm will never be equally applicable to men and women as a baseline criterion , as long as we live in a world where women feel far less safe than men .
