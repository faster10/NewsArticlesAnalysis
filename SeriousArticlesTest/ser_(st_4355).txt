Palmer had an ugly ending to what was overall a dream season in 2015 with a disastrous performance against the Panthers . He was 23 of 40 passing for 235 yards , one touchdown and four interceptions , and he also lost two fumbles . He was dealing with a finger injury from Week 15 , which could have hindered his play , but he should rebound in 2016 and continue to play at a high level . Cardinals general manager Steve Keim already said Palmer will " bounce back " on a local radio station in Arizona , and he called Palmer " our guy . " Palmer was the No . 4 quarterback in standard leagues in 2015 behind only Newton , Brady and Russell Wilson , and those are the only four quarterbacks with 400 Fantasy points . I hope Fantasy owners actually use the outing against Carolina as an excuse to pass on Palmer , who I have ranked No . 7 in 2016 behind Newton , Aaron Rodgers , Luck , Ben Roethlisberger , Brady and Wilson . Then he could fall on Draft Day , and I would be thrilled to have him as my starter . Yes , he ' s 36 and could start to decline , but I love Bruce Arians ' offense , especially with Michael Floyd , John Brown and Larry Fitzgerald . Palmer had 4 , 671 passing yards , 35 touchdowns and 11 interceptions in 2015 , and a repeat performance is certainly possible in 2016 . He ' s worth drafting with a mid round pick in all leagues despite the poor finish in the NFC Championship Game .
