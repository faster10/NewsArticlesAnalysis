Trademarks propose a commercial transaction . When you see or hear a trademark , you immediately receive information in a short hand way that communicates where the products come from , or what level of service you can expect . Trademarks are First Amendment protected expression . There should be no issue with limiting their use to mislead the public . After all , what point do they serve if they do not propose a truthful association with their owner ? And what rational governmental purpose does it serve to deny a benefit to a business because it might be deemed " immoral " by someone ?
