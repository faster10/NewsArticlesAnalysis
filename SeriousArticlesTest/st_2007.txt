Tongues have started wagging about the future of the talks . What a prosaic interpretation ? Is there any doubt about resumption of talks ? Absolutely not ! It is just a matter of time when the two countries will again start talk the talk , but what is more important is whether they will walk the walk . No two neighbours can remain in a perpetual mode of denial for long . In the past also , the two countries have been involved in talks despite going to full fledged wars three times and a brief conflict in Kargil in 1999 since their independence . But they were back to talks after sometime . It is an on and off exercise which will go on before the two nations regain trust about each other to operationalise the full scale structured talks . The leadership of both the countries is mature enough to understand that war would only lead to catastrophe and complicate the matters beyond repairs . Dialogue can only take them forward to any meaningful and lasting solution to the issues that bedevil their relations .
