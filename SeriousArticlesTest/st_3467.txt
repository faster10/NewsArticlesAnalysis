Speaking to a group of reporters on Wednesday , Obama was asked about the Academy Awards , which for the second year in a row included an all white slate of acting nominees . I think when everybody s story is told , then that makes for better art , Obama said . That makes for better entertainment . It makes everybody feel part of one American family . So I think , as a whole , the industry should do what every other industry should do , which is to look for talent , provide opportunity to everybody .
