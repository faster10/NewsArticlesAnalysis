Corinthian , which once enrolled more than 70 , 000 students , is one of the worst of the " predator colleges " schools that offer dubious degrees , saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year . Many of these schools are for profit career colleges that operate mostly online . It ' s no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U . S . Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer .
