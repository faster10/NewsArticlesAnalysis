Thomas Jefferson was said to have written , It is to secure our rights that we resort to government at all . Mr Sanders , on the other hand , offered this , in a January 19 Twitter post : Our job is to tell every kid in this country , that if they work hard , regardless of family income , they will get a college education . Or this , the same day : I got a message for the Walton family of Walmart : Get off of welfare and pay your workers a living wage . Or this a day earlier , of a Martin Luther King Jr . quote : Call it democracy , or call it democratic socialism , but there must be a better distribution of wealth .
