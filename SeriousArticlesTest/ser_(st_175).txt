I m not a nostalgic person , David Bowie told EW in 1997 on the occasion of his 50th birthday , a milestone he celebrated with a concert at New York City s fabled Madison Square Garden . The rock icon was discussing his decision to perform that night with younger artists , including Foo Fighters and Smashing Pumpkins Billy Corgan , instead of with contemporaries and longtime friends such as the Rolling Stones or Tina Turner . But with those five succinct words , he might as well have been summing up his entire approach to his career ? one that yielded 28 studio albums , well over 100 million records sold worldwide , and an influence that has spanned generations and disciplines , inspiring everyone from Madonna and Annie Lennox to Arcade Fire , Kanye West , and Lorde . My reason for performing is not to please an audience , Bowie continued . It s to present what I believe are exciting new ideas .
