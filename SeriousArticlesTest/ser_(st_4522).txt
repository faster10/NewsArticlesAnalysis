Oklahoma City star Kevin Durant chastised the media for its unfair coverage of one of his idols , but Bryant said the attention , positive or negative , didn ' t bother him . " I don ' t budge from that stuff . I appreciate the good stuff . I appreciate the bad stuff . I would never whine : ' Oh , you ' re too hard on me . ' Stop , " Bryant said . " I sincerely appreciate the bad as much as I do the good and hopefully the players understand that this is the journey and this is the cycle . You ' ve got to roll with it . It ' s all good . "
