Many people know that the Mississippi River flows through the Crescent City , New Orleans , Louisiana but fewer are aware that this is only one of two paths it takes to the Gulf . The Mississippi divides to create its delta upstream of Baton Rouge at a place called Old River . The Atchafalaya River is the western channel . In 1963 , the Corps built a dam with sluice gates at Old River between the Mississippi and Atchafalaya to keep the shorter Atchafalaya route from " capturing " the whole river . Later , they built more structures to gain better control .
