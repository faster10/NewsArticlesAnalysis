For more than 40 years , he was rock roll s greatest innovator , blazing a trail right up until the end . His acclaimed final album , Blackstar , was released on his 69th birthday , just two days before his Jan . 10 passing . Following a very private 18 month struggle with cancer , the artist died peacefully , according to a public statement , and surrounded by his family , which included two children , daughter Alexandria , 15 , and son Duncan , 44 , and his devoted second wife , supermodel Iman , 60 , whom he married in 1992 . Even those closest to the musician were shocked by news of his death . I received an email from him seven days ago , said Brian Eno , who collaborated with Bowie on classic albums like 1977 s Low and Heroes , in a statement . It was as funny as always , and as surreal , looping through word games and allusions and all the usual stuff we did . It ended with this sentence : Thank you for our good times , brian . they will never rot . And it was signed Dawn . I realize now he was saying goodbye .
