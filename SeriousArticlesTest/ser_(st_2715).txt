" Your audacity resonates in each one of us , a strong sense of generosity and sharing . Thank you for taking us where we never thought we could go . And in your typical spirit , you left by surprise as if to remind us once more , that in life as in music , each great performance could be the last one even if the show must go on . You hoped for an exit that reflected your life , you succeeded this as well . We carry , and will continue to carry on in your spirit everything you taught us . "
