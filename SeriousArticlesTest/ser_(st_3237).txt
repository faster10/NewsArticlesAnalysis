Coach of the Year candidate Ron Rivera ( he s the Sporting News pick already ) made that indication on Wednesday , and he also suggested Jonathan Stewart ( a graduate of Timberline High School in Lacey ) could return to playing this week . Stewart had two of four touchdowns against Seattle and led all rushers in that game with 78 yards , a total that indicates how tough the defenses were against the run . Lynch was held to just 54 yards and a touchdown . Cam Newton , the league s top rushing QB this season , had just 30 yards on seven carries , while Russell Wilson was right behind Lynch with 53 yards on eight carries .
