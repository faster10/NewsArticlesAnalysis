The Seleka began advancing south this year , burning and looting as it went and seizing Bangui in March . One leader , Michel Djotodia , proclaimed himself president , the first head of state from the marginalized northeast . The Seleka was later officially disbanded , but as many as 15 , 000 kept their arms and instead continued to wreak havoc in Bangui and elsewhere . They mainly targeted Christian communities , which in turn mobilized self defense units known as anti Balaka ( literally " anti machete . " )
