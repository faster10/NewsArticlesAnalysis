We project Romo to barely crack the top 10 over the rest of the season . Sure , he is a better option than choosing between Joe Flacco or Jameis Winston or Alex Smith , etc . , which you likely have faced this season . But standing pat is like taking a breather as soon as you escape the barn . Keep running . If your trade deadline hasn t passed , take a stab at a swap ? targeting Derek Carr , Blake Bortles or even Wilson in return .
