If only the Princeton alum ' s advice had come out 30 years earlier when I was in college , perhaps I could have avoided the costly mistake of focusing on what makes me come alive and then pursuing it for a living . Perhaps if I ' d focused instead on nailing down a man by the time I was 22 , I could be going to cocktail parties and co opting my husband and children ' s successes , bragging about them as if they were my own , rather than being forced to talk about the current state of politics or what we can do as a society to engage the next generation in the struggles of today .
