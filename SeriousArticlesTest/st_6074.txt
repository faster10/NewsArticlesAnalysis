Place that amount of money , in cash , in an envelope and toss it into your fireplace this winter . I doubt there is anyone who would do that . Why then is it OK to throw away food ? Maybe people in America have so much extra money that throwing food away is not a big deal . I have travelled to many countries , some rich and some poor . Regardless of a country ' s level of wealth , I noticed one thing people did not throw food away the way I have seen in America .
