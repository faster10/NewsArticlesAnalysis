59th minute : Torres is clapped off the pitch and then given a congratulatory slap on the back by coach Diego Simeone as he is replaced by Koke . An industrious performance by Torres but he was caught offside far too regularly and was unable to muster a real chance of note all night . He will hope that a return to full fitness over the coming weeks will enable him to rediscover his best form . On the basis of this match though , that could be a long time coming . . .
