Clinton is a learner and a listener . She learned from the Obama campaign in 2008 , and adjusted , running as much more of a liberal this time around . She learned from the Sanders campaign that voters take Wall Street reform seriously , and she responded by putting together a plan that Paul Krugman declared better than the Sanders plan , both in terms of focus and performability . That s the kind of person you want in the White House . Politics is an ever shifting landscape , and having someone who is open to engaging and adjusting is an important thing . ( And one of the most underrated aspects of the Obama administration , who often let liberal activist movements form his agenda . )
