" Steph is something different , " he said . " I think Kevin Garnett hit on something when he said he ' s in a league of his own , just like when Magic came in , Kobe came in , LeBron came in , Michael Jordan came in . They were something different , something special . It ' s entertaining even as a basketball player to watch him play . What Steph does is something we ' ve never seen before . Reggie Miller and Ray Allen , those guys were more spot up shooters , where Steph can create his own shot . "
