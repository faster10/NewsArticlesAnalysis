But even a brilliant extraterrestrial like Bowie had to start out as a mere mortal . Before he revolutionized rock roll with androgynous characters like Ziggy Stardust , he was born David Robert Jones to working class parents in 1947 London . As a child , he was already looking beyond Britain s borders : He was tuned in to American pop and jazz pioneers like Little Richard and John Coltrane . I had America mania when I was a kid , but I loved all the things that America rejects , he told EW in 1997 . It was black music , it was the beatnik poets , it was all the stuff that I thought was the true rebellious subversive side . His earliest recordings were released under the name Davie ( or sometimes Davy ) Jones , but , unhappy about his lack of success with that moniker ? and to avoid confusion with the Monkees singer of the same name ? he rechristened himself David Bowie . I have no confidence in David Jones as a public figure , Bowie told People in 1976 . The new name ? inspired by what he said was the ultimate American knife ? was the medium for a conglomerate of statements and illusions .
