When I was a kid , I used to see Cinerama movies and Todd AO , and it was in the days we had what we used to call roadshows , when we ' d have one spectacular Cinerama theater per town , not 50 . At that time , even when " 2001 " first came out , there were only about 55 or 60 Cinerama theaters in the world . You ' d have a period of time where a movie like " 2001 " would run for months or epic movies like " Sound of Music " would run for two years .
