Under LePage s administration , Maine has placed a five year limit on welfare benefits , launched new investigations of welfare fraud , and balked at new anti poverty programs , such as the Medicaid expansion . When attacked , he defends himself with his biography ? LePage grew up impoverished and abused ? and by asserting his compassion . I care for the poor , he said at a town hall last October . I am the one willing to work with the poor , and have a safety net we can all depend on and make people understand that nothing in life is free . You have to get back to society . And when his language gets ahead of him ? as we ve seen with his D Money comment ? he brushes it off and moves along .
