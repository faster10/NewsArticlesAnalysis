The great 20th Century physicist , Richard Feynman , wrote in his autobiography : ' Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given , if you know them . You must do the best you can if you know anything at all wrong , or possibly wrong to explain it . If you make a theory , for example , and advertise it , or put it out , then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it , as well as those that agree with it . ' This the Royal Society has failed to do .
