MF : They have not in the way that they need to . So , that s a part of it , Sophie . The other part of it is that we have to look at each other , we look at the U . S . , we look at Europe , we look at Russian Federation , and we examine this math problem that we re facing , and this math problem that we re facing is a demographic shift in the world that s happening . And when you begin to look at where that demographic shift is going to occur it s in places like North Africa , it s in places like Central Asia , it s in places like the Middle East , it s in places like South Asia and South East Asia . So , we have to begin to understand that this is not an East West world , folks , that s actually more of a North South world , and we have to decide U . S . , Europe , Russia and other , other countries , countries in South America , maybe and even China and India , how do we want the world to be over the course of the next 10 years , 25 years , 50 years . I mean , this is not about and don t believe for a second that we re going to defeat the Islamic State in 2 years . This has been described as a Hundred Year War . I can t see that far , I can t think that far , but I can certainly think much further than the next 4 years and a presidential election in the U . S .
