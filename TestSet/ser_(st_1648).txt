My solution ? There is a long tradition in American politics of debating an empty chair . Clint Eastwood gave it a try , to mixed reviews , at the last Republican convention , talking to an invisible Barack Obama . As Smithsonian magazine noted in covering Eastwood s 2012 stagecraft , the tradition stretches back to at least 1924 , when the Progressive party vice presidential nominee , Burton K Wheeler , took a stab at an invisible President Calvin Coolidge . That occured in Des Moines , as a matter of fact .
