In 2015 , we celebrated our program ' s 50th anniversary , and we shared countless stories of service . As AmeriCorps VISTA ' s new director , I hope to share more of these stories in the coming months to show how AmeriCorps VISTA members are working directly with communities and strengthening the efforts to lift individuals and families out of poverty . In the meantime , I invite you to see AmeriCorps VISTA ' s work in action , in real time , and meet the people who proudly proclaim IamVISTA .
