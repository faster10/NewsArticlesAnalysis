No changes to the predicted final four teams , but there was one tweak in moving Oklahoma ahead of Alabama . While the committee does love the Crimson Tide , the convincing road win by the Sooners at Oklahoma State this week combined with the Big 12 title ( and overall impressive resume ) should be enough to give a slight edge to Oklahoma this week regardless of what happens in Atlanta . The reason the committee would be inclined to do this is because it can then put Oklahoma and Alabama in the Cotton Bowl without SEC fans throwing fits ( because they ' d be the No . 2 seed traveling down the road instead of the No . 3 seed ) . It doesn ' t matter when it comes to the order but would help with optics .
