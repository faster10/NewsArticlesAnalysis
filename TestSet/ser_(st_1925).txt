KAREN MAJEWSKI : No , I m not afraid . And actually , I d like to make another correction . We have , as of our last election , which was a couple weeks ago , we elected a Muslim majority council . Whether the demographics of the city would say we re a Muslim majority city , I don t think that we re there yet . I think we re probably somewhere in the 40 percent Muslim for the city overall . But our city council that will take office in January will be a majority Muslim council .
