Muddle the message . Miley Cyrus ' butt shaking , foam finger waving performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in August was a lesson in how shock sells . Though the act spawned much outrage Vogue reportedly pulled its plans to feature her on the cover , and longtime boyfriend Liam Hemsworth moved on as well album sales climbed . But then she followed it up with a topless photo shoot with Terry Richardson a not quite pornographic music video and an admission that , yes , she is singing about drugs ( sorry , kids ! ) . In the end , the takeaway was clear : The act overshadows the talent . Chances are good that as we move into 2014 , it ' s the foam finger we ' ll remember more than Miley ' s songs .
