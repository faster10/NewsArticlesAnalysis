Though hip hop had always incorporated rock samples and toyed with live instrumentation ( Afrika Bambaataa liked to toss Rolling Stones records into his break beats ) , " Licensed to Ill " also essentially invented rap rock . " Fight for Your Right " is the obvious example , but Slayer ' s Kerry King ( another signee of Def Jam co founder Rick Rubin ) also lent some shredding guitar to " No Sleep Til Brooklyn . " " Rhymin ' and Stealin ' " is built around samples from Black Sabbath , Led Zeppelin , and the Clash .
