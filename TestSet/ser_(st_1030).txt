Most would be MEPs contest the elections with the endorsement of national political parties . National parties such as the Christian Democrats in Germany or the Labour Party in Britain put up approved lists of candidates . But when they are in the European Parliament the MEPs mostly operate in wider groups of left or right such as the Socialist Group ( PES ) , the Liberal Group ( ELDR ) or the European Greens . The main conservative grouping is the European Peoples Party ( EPP ) . However , David Cameron , the national leader of Britain ' s Conservatives , has withdrawn his members from the EPP , regarding it as too federalist in its approach . The groups work as a bloc when they can and have " whips " designed to make them as cohesive as possible .
