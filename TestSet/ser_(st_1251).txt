The second concession was allowing the president , the Secretary of Defense , and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to decide together the date on which the new law , once passed , would actually take effect . The three are already public supporters of repeal and can be trusted to act in good faith . They may not certify the implementation plan as quickly as some repeal advocates would like ( some have unrealistically suggested a matter of days or weeks after the working group issues its report ) , but I believe that they will within a reasonable amount of time .
