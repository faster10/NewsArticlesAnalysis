Sexual freedom is center stage at an Umphrey ' s McGee concert . Bassist Ray Stasik will pose for and lure the loose females in the front rows to remove their bras and underpanties and hurl them on to the stage . Stasik will perversely hang them from his microphone stand on display as if it ' s some type of award or badge of honor . Remember that one person ' s definition of " sexual freedom " could be construed as abuse or in the very least , an act of deviance , especially from the parents of one of Stasik ' s victims .
