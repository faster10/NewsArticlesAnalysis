It ' s really such a personal journey making a record , but even more so writing the songs . And you feel a bit obsessed about them at this stage as well , I think , because until they get to a producer they ' re still yours , at this stage where I ' m at now . So maybe letting go is going to be a little bit difficult , and I know that when I involve a producer that ' s sort of what will happen to a degree . Of course I ' ll remain very involved , but I guess I ' ve just got to get out there and meet these producers face to face and talk through . I ' ve just got to get myself to that next stage .
