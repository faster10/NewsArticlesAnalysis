Said Jim , " One day Steve and I smelled the unmistakable scent of weed upstairs , which is no big deal , but the next thing you know , Peterson comes down with these two CD ' s , puts them on and we were like , ' Whoa , you ' ve got some talent , dude ! ' I mean , I never really got high before that day , but when I heard that mix , I thought to myself , ' If this is what getting stoned is like , then I ' ve got to get in on it ' . He molds songs into each other like sculptors do clay . "
