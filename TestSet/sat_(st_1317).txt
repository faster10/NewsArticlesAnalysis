Rookie ICU nurse practitioner Brian Thompson is a procedural phenom and is on pace to join the elite 100 100 Club : 100 central lines and 100 arterial lines successfully placed . All the more impressive when you consider he has yet to fumble a single procedure kit . He is currently leading the league in votes for this year ' s All Star Team . Unfortunately , his counterpart Wes Peterson has had the opposite season , leading the Eastern Conference with 35 pneumothoraces thus far . Sit Peterson for now until he shows signs of medical competence . Hot : Thompson . Not : Peterson .
