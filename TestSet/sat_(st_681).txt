" These days , just about anyone can get into college , but what happens on your first night on campus when you ' re wandering around and someone offers you a beer ? " asked Hartford , otherwise known to his friends as Ten Beer Steer . " If you don ' t know what you ' re doing , and if the groundwork for success hasn ' t been laid , how do you expect to get up to the level of accomplishment that your friends are at ? I am grateful for every party I ' ve ever been to they have all made me a better person , and I wouldn ' t be the same person I am now if my buddies hadn ' t called me ' ass sucking fag ' whenever I failed to chug a full beer , or written ' I Like Cock ' on my forehead for my Mom to see when I passed out after three drinks .
