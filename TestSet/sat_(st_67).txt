All three rebels were in fact separately condemned to being hanged , drawn and quartered , an exceptionally cruel , long and bloody method of public execution . Convicts were fastened to a hurdle , or a wooden panel , and drawn by horse to the place of execution , where they were hanged almost to the point of death , but released while still alive . They were then emasculated , eviscerated and their bowels were burnt before them , before they were finally beheaded . Their bodies were then cut into four parts , to be exposed like the head , in different parts of the Kingdom .
