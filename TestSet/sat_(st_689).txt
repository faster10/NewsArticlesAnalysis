" Being ambiguously afraid is not only not unusual , but is actually helpful and could someday be harnessed into a way of bringing known and unknown terrorists to justice , " said a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security . " Evidence of this is clear in cases like that of Mr Ovarenus , in which his omnipresent fear of being victimized by terrorism manifested itself in suspicion of specific items and people . If Mr Ovarenus had contacted the authorities and the bags actually been bombs or people terrorists , then he would have been the first citizen in America to stop an act of terrorism single handedly . As it turns out , he ' s just another shmoe on a plane for Newark . "
