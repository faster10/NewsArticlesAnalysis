" The Suburbs " is the band ' s most adventurous album yet : See the psychotic speed strings on " Empty Room , " the Crazy Horse rush of " Month of May , " the synth pop disco of " Sprawl II ( Mountains Beyond Mountains ) . " Win Butler and his wife , R gine Chassagne , sing about suburban boredom , fear of change and wanting to have a kid of their own always scaling their intimate confessions to arena rock levels and finding beauty wherever they look .
