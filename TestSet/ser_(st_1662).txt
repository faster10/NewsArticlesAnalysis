I ' ve thought a lot more this year about the 72 10 season than I have in the past because they ' re so close to doing it . ? Now they ' ve just picked up their fourth loss in Detroit the other day so I ' d lie to you if I say I wasn ' t happy about it . But records and rules are made to be broken . It ' s going to happen one day . The longer it lasts the better it is . But they ' re a great team , they play in a great system , they move the ball well , they play together well . . . they ' re fun to watch .
