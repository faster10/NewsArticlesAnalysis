Sting I ' ve seen a few times and he really inspired me , in the sense that he breaks the songs down a lot and will take a different approach . He ' ll take an acoustic approach to them , he ' ll rearrange them for the live stage . And I thought , " I really admire someone taking the license to do that , owning that . " I played around with that a little bit in the show as well , so that was an influence . I really admire artists that are willing to take a different approach and a different angle to their shows . So I did some of that .
