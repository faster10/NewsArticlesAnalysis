Trump is clever . Just look at the way he stepped around George Stephanopoulos persistent attempt to pin him down on registering American Muslims . Yes , he said ? for refugees . He never addressed the actual question . Arguably , refugees are already registered ? they re certainly vetted , during a two year process . Why would he play this sort of word game ? Because ? given his infinite narcissism ? he may have already imagined himself as President . Setting up a registry for Muslims would be unconstitutional . Setting up a registry for refugees ? well , that already exists . Problem solved !
