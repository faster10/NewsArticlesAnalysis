At her 6 month follow up visit , her internist was shocked . " I walked into the room with pre printed scripts for metformin and Zocor , and I just couldn ' t believe it . I have never seen anything like this . She was smiling and had all this self respect . She must have dropped like 20 pounds . She just seemed like a different person , all bubbly and fun to talk to . Her labs were all improved too . I have no idea what happened here , like why is she so different that my other 400 patients ? "
