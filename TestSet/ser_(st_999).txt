What I ve realized is that , when you care too much , you re not living at your full potential . When you really stop caring about what people say , that s when you really start living . It s such an amazing feeling . It s about loving who you are , owning who you are and knowing that it s O . K . to live your life how you want to live it . We re all human , which means we re not all perfect . It s so cool to think that I might help women think about who they want to be and then encourage them to be that person with no remorse . I want to help women just be happy in their own skin .
