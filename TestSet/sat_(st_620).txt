" Marmalard is a man who knows what he likes , and when he finds out that maybe he ' s wrong , he gets upset , " said former roommate Don Benson . " Like the time when ' Sex in the City ' was on , he just kind of kept coming in and out of the room , laughing at me for watching it , but staying just a little longer each time . I left the room and came back an hour later only to find him sitting in my chair , totally engrossed . I called him out on that one , but he was like , ' Oh , I just sat down to tie my shoe ' . "
