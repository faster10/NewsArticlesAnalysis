From there she pivoted to her standard spiel about how Wall Street guys are funding groups that attack her and she s the only person who can fight them because she s fought them before . She has a point about how the receipt of political donations from a given industry does not automatically mean you ve been bought , but the issue goes beyond that . For me , the problem with this answer and with Clinton s speaking fees isn t that they show that she s in the thrall of banks or corrupted by the financial system ? it s more a question of being part of the problem .
