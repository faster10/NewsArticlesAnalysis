( On if will be easier to go into next season that it was to go into this season : ) It s not the same . This is not the same . It will be a different season , as they all are different . There s similarities , but this one s different . We ll watch how the offseason goes , and I ll be totally on point watching what is going to occur as we go through it , but I don t foresee anywhere near the effect of coming off the season . That s why I go back to Atlanta , I think it feels more like that season . We re very disappointed about the outcome , but yet knowing that we have a chance to be really good . That s really valuable going into the offseason , as well as being healthy , is a great asset .
