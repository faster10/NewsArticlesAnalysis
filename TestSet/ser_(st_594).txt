My initiation was an abbreviated tour , three games in three stadiums , with a beach condo in Indian Shores as home base . I ' m not a huge baseball fan , though I have found that appearing tolerant of sports generally makes you more likeable . But I consider myself a loyal girlfriend to a Braves fan who starts counting down on January 1 to the day pitchers and catchers report , who brought me to a Montgomery Biscuits game early in our relationship . Plus , we would be staying on the beach , so I welcomed the opportunity to familiarize myself with one of the nation ' s most cherished pastimes .
