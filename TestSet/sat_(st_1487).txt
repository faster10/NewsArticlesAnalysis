" It got so bad we had a block association meeting , " said a nearby neighbor identified only as ' Fiona . ' " Sometimes as late as 12 midnight she ' d be in that garage , tap tap tapping away . We ' d hear Britney say , ' Do it again ! Say it again ! ' Then the next morning there ' d be poor little Ashley , wobbling along in her pink little shoes , trying to catch up to the school bus . It was pathetic . "
