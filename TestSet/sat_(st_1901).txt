" I don ' t see what the big deal is really " Commented Robert Shaw , who we spotted on the opposite side of the street holding both middle fingers up in the direction of the protesters . " You got a bunch of horses that are dying from neglect and a bunch of winos , junkies and riff raff that don ' t need to be causing trouble for the decent folks here in town . You ship ' em off to where they can ' t be a bother and let ' em eat some horse meat . Hell , they should be happy we are feeding them at all ! All these liberal schmucks who are getting so worked up about it should adopt a few dozen starving horses and let some of these scumbags crash in their house for a couple of weeks and maybe then they can tell us what the best solution would be .
