Instead of showing a confidence in what Jones was able to do last week , Mike Tomlin and Todd Haley went conservative . It left the team stalled instead of maintaining any rhythm or momentum . In a situation where they could have kicked for three points , the coaches once again elected to go for it on a fourth and one and watched Williams get stuffed . In this case , it wasn t necessarily a bad idea since the kick was in the neighborhood of 49 yards , but Boswell made a 48 yarder last weekend without issues .
