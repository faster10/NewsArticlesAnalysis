" This is not unlike southern states that still have statutes dedicated to Jefferson Davis , Nathaniel Bedford Forrest , or General Lee , " Pidgey said , " it ' s a bold declaration by certain political types that they don ' t care about reality . They don ' t care about history . They don ' t care about the fact that his man , this Dick Cheney , for no other reasons than war and pride , drug us into the absolutely stupidest war we ' d been in since the Vietnam War . And I ' ll remind everyone , this cowardly bastard signed up all your sons and daughters to die when he never served a damn day in his life in any branch of the armed forces ! "
