" We tried to promote a boycott of Mexican drugs in the states to prove the breadth of our influence , but it ' s so hard these days to tell what comes from just south of the border , and what ' s been brought up from Columbia , Venezuela , or from some horticulturist ' s basement , " said Paul Hornsby , journalist for High Times magazine .
