It s never easy to watch once great athletes suffer the inevitable decline that comes with age , but watching Bryant and Manning recede from greatness has been particularly painful because of who they are and what their careers have represented . There are some athletes whose reputations derive entirely from what they did on the fields of play . Think Julius Erving and Barry Sanders , two athletes best remembered for the artistry and unparalleled athletic skills they brought to their respective sports . Neither man s personality was so big or unique , or so at odds or in sync with the mores of sports culture , that it impacted the public s perception of their careers . Appreciation of both Erving and Sanders stems entirely from what they did .
