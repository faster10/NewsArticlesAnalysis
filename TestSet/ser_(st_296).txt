Former Union Minister Rasheed Masood and his nephew Imran Masood dominate the region s political narrative . They have often shifted their loyalties between the Lok Dal , SP and Congress . Just a few months before the 2012 Assembly Elections , the older Mr Masood quit the SP and joined the Congress . Desperate to score well in the polls , the Congress gave him a free hand in fielding candidates in seven constituencies of western U . P . , a move that annoyed a promising Congress leader , Saad Hussain , who comes from Gandhi s school of thought . To mark his protest , Mr Hussain quit the party and joined the SP . A mineral water and plastic manufacturer , he canvassed support for the late SP leader Rajinder Rana , who won the polls from the Muslim dominated Deoband constituency . After proving his worth in the SP , Mr Hussain was courted by the Congress , which appointed him the national coordinator for minorities .
