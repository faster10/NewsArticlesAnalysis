And , more generally , although the U . S . political system still feeds untrammeled greed by enabling super rich campaign donors and lobbyists to buy the political class , the American people and much of the rest of the world are coming to recognize the urgency of sustainable development .

These new SDGs will become markers and guideposts for building a world that combines prosperity , fairness , and environmental sanity a world we truly want and need for ourselves and our children .
