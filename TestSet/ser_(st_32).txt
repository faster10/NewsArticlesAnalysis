If you look at the whole of 2015 , everybody neglects he played six months , said Wenger . I personally think he is world class . I did not take Petr Cech based on the performances of Ospina . Petr Cech was just an exceptional opportunity . Unfortunately , Ospina has been punished by that decision . We are lucky because he has a top attitude , very intelligent , brave , quick . The difference with Cech is he has less experience and his size . I think he can be the goalkeeper of the future here as well .
