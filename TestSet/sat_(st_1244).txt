" My mother had a really good relationship with her doctor for years , " said local resident John Pincussin . " Growing up , she relied on the ' little helper ' he prescribed her to deal with me and my siblings . But as she got into her sixties , we all started to wonder if 15 milligrams of Valium twice a day was making her tired , especially when she was also taking Flexeril , gabapentin , oxycodone , and Lyrica for her chronic pain . When she fell twice in the same week and went to the ER each time , she got a full body CT scan each time and cipro for a possible UTI . Those didn ' t help at all . But then Dr Hopewell realized that she probably needed to cut back a little on her meds , and she hasn ' t been this peppy since the ' 70s ! "
