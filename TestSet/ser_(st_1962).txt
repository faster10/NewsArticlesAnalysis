As I say , all of this is bad for our politics and polity . If Herman Cain cannot stand up to these charges , if he refuses to , then he should step out of the race . A man big enough to run for president should be big enough to have a full and candid press conference on all of this he wants us to elect him president after all , he ' s asking us to trust our lives and the country ' s life to him . This could be one of his finest moments and it could be one of his worst . But either way , he must confront the moment candidly and manfully .
