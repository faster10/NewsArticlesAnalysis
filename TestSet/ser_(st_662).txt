All in all it was a bust for Gowdy and the Benghazi committee , to the point that conservative pundits were griping about how poorly the Republicans fared against Clinton . Anyone who doubted that the committee was a partisan exercise in Clinton bashing came away free of doubts . The only sliver of good news for the Republicans is that it likely won t matter . The notion that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton engineered some sort of evil Benghazi cover up is already assumed to be true in the minds of conservatives and Republican voters . The fact that Gowdy and crew spent the day stepping on rakes and scoring own goals in a failed attempt to prove it won t change their minds . And the House GOP won t put the brakes on the investigation because the committee s utility as a vehicle for strategic press leaks outweighs the bad press it s enduring at the moment . The Benghazi committee will grind on , performing much the same role it always has .
