" Whether or not the attacks are real or imagined , we expect September 11th , 2009 to have a major impact on the way we view our safety and security and shape our foreign policy , " said NYC Fire Dept . Chief Robert Lowery . " I have personally called all my friends and family to say goodbye , walked through Battery Park one last time , and had a whiskey with my men in the NYFD , because who knows what kind of 9 11 this one will be ? I could be trapped in the burning rubble of a building destroyed by terrorists , or becoming infected with an unknown , incurable virus that was dropped into the water system , or facing dinosaurs reconstituted with terrorist DNA .
