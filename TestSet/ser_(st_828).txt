Do I really think the Mayflower should have been turned back at Plymouth harbor ? I d hate to give up Thanksgiving ( it s not Columbus Day , after all ) , and for my own sake ? as I m descended , like about 10 of the population , from passengers on that boat ? I m glad they came . Despite the fact that I don t agree with everything the Pilgrims did and believed , they are the bedrock of this country in all its imperfection .
