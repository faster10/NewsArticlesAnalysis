" We can ' t govern , and in fact we don ' t want to govern , " Gowdy said , " and no one should be surprised by that . We profess a deep , abiding distrust of the very damn government we ' re begging you to let us control . Think about that . It ' s like a veterinarian asking to care for your sick dog and then taking it out back and clubbing it to death , handing it to you , and saying , ' There you go , now your dog isn ' t sick anymore ' and handing you a big , fat tax bill at the end of it all . So of course we ' re going to just spend millions and millions of dollars on these scandal hearings instead of doing any actual governing , which we ' re not interested in in the slightest anyway .
