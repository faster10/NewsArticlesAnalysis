" Well , sure we ordered the torture ! " he said , rolling his eyes exasperatedly . " What , you think we wouldn ' t want to be hospitable to the Iraqis ? Listen : when you have someone over to your house , you offer them a drink , and you don ' t swear if they don ' t want you to , and all that happy crappy shit . So when I ' m over in Iraq , I ' m sure as hell going to be a good houseguest and not swear , by which I mean torture them in blatant disregard of the Geneva conventions ! "
