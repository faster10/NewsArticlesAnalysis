In medical school , I found this ugly , indurated , black mass along my right lower quadrant , towards my inguinal crease . It wasn ' t tender per se , but it was extremely irritating , a nagging pain . Like anyone would , I played with it and picked at it . I showed it to my friends and family . I asked them to touch it and it made them uncomfortable . They all told me the same thing : " It looks funny , " " It ' s probably benign , " and " Stop pointing it at me , that ' s rude . " Sadly , everyone was wrong . This thing is malignant and causes me much pain and suffering .
