I don t think too much magic goes out on the field , too many illusions . Both teams you kind of see what you get and you get what you see , the Mets outfielder said . Tricks up their sleeve , I think those are great figures of speech , but it s baseball . And you go out there and you throw the ball , you catch the ball and you hit the ball . And I think the World Series is pretty self explanatory . We ve both played 200 games . We know what each other team has . You throw the gloves out on the field and see who wins .
