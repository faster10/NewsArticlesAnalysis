Clinton responded to this with perhaps her most cynical moment of the campaign so far . Not only do I have hundreds of thousands of donors , most of them small , she said . I ' m very proud that for the first time a majority of my donors are women , 60 percent . That pander got applause . As did the following one : I represented New York , and I represented New York on 9 11 when we were attacked . Where were we attacked ? We were attacked in downtown Manhattan where Wall Street is . I did spend a whole lot of time and effort helping them rebuild . That was good for New York .
