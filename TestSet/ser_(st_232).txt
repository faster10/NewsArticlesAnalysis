Then there was Republican Rep . Joe Walsh , who last July called on President Obama to " quit lying " in regards to the debt ceiling debate . Can anyone remember something like this with previous presidents ? I can ' t either . And , of course , there ' s Donald Trump , not only periodically renewing the " birther " fabrication , but also demanding to see President Obama ' s college grades , implying he doesn ' t think Obama is intellectually qualified to be president .
