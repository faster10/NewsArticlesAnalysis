" It just seems like they ' re a competitive , fiery bunch I think kind of like our guys . It just seems like they never go away , " Mets captain David Wright said on Saturday at Citi Field . " It just seems like they find a way to win no matter what the score is , no matter what the situation is . They grind it out . They never die . And I think that ' s a tremendous compliment for a team . So we ' re going to have our hands full , for sure . "
