( On what happened on RB Jonathan Stewart s big run and LB Luke Kuechly s interception for a touchdown : ) Yeah , unfortunately we didn t read the play well . It was just a new , little wrinkle that they put in . We didn t read the play well at the linebacker spot , and Earl Thomas came up to make the tackle for a seven or eight yard gain like we normally do , and he slipped and fell and wasn t able to make the play . That s a normal , nice play for them , and then you tackle him and you go on . We were so good at that , and so consistent at that , that it really jumps out at you when that happens . I said there was one explosive run in the game , and that was it . From that point on they rushed for 80 yards , for a whole day of 40 runs . There was 40 other runs to get 80 yards . So it hurt because the field shift , we had a great opportunity the next play , Michael Bennett knocks the ball on the ground and it gets kicked around , and they wind up getting it back . That s how things happen in the game , and those plays that kind of get forgotten , but also were the ones that could have been significant . We had a shot . On the other one , on the interception , we were rushed . Russ Russell Wilson , he got a flash of Marshawn Lynch checking down , and he tried to get rid of the football , and it just didn t hit right . The decision didn t work out , and it goes right to Luke Kuechly for a touchdown . That s about as huge a turnaround , bang , bang , as you could put up , and we did it . It didn t wreck us for the day , it just made it really difficult , and they were too good for us to get back in it .
