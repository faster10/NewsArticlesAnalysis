Ultimately the interview opened up more questions than it did to answer them . Was this a legitimate gang stalker I spoke with ? And if so , were being completely truthful ? No one can ever completely know , and that ' s the crux from which gang stalkers derive their power . anonymity . Mystery . Confusion . It ' s Chinese water torture directed at the persons psyche . It ' s all the little things piling up until minor annoyances engulf your life . For these reasons I fear gang stalking will continue to be a crime perpetuated on citizens both innocent and guilty for a much longer time than we had hoped .
