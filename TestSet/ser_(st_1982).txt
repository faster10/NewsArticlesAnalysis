If the answer is yes , go on about your business . Obamacare doesn ' t really affect you . At least not yet . While Obamacare relies on making Medicare more efficient as a way to pay for some new services for younger people , it is not supposed to change the services offered by Medicare . One big test of this promise is Medicare Advantage . These are privately administered insurance plans that provide Medicare services to seniors . They cost the government more per person to provide Medicare . So , Obamacare seeks to bring their spending back in line with the rest of Medicare . This could lead to changes in Medicare Advantage options , like gym memberships and other items that are offered as enticements . But the same core Medicare services are supposed to remain in effect . The same goes for Medicaid . If you get your insurance from one of the 50 state run Medicaid programs , Obamacare should not affect you . But you ' ll have a lot more company in these programs , which will grow to insure a larger portion of Americans .
