If yes , Obamacare is going to affect you . It is possible that your insurance plan won ' t change , but it ' s just as likely that your plan doesn ' t meet all the minimum requirements the law imposes . These include new rules for how much profit companies can take for plans , new rules for coverage of women ' s services , new rules for how much more insurance companies can charge for women than men , and a lot more . So , you might have to buy a more expensive plan . In this case , your insurance company has probably already let you know . It ' s also possible you might want a new plan . Check out your new state health insurance exchange or the one the federal government set up in your state if your state government refused to do so . People who like and dislike Obamacare have something to like about costs of individual plans . Prelminary estimates have come in lower than some government prognosticators expected . So it is fair to say Obamacare might be cheaper than expected for some individuals . But it is also accurate to say that premiums are likely to rise for healthy people on the individual market . Why ? They ' re going to get more robust insurance plans that cover more things . At the same time , a lot of sick people who get private insurance now pay a ton for it their costs could decrease .
