Mayweather ' s manager , Al Haymon , says the fight would pose as little risk to Romney as possible , while noting that it would be dangerous nevertheless . " Floyd is serious about this . He wants this fight to happen . We ' d do whatever we could to mitigate the risk to Mr Romney , though . He ' d wear a helmet , and Floyd would use slightly bigger , softer gloves . But let ' s not kid ourselves here , Mitt Romney would never look the same after a fight like this . "
