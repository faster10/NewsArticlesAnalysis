Said guitarist Jake Goldberg : " I ' m realizing now that expecting tail from this outfit is like one or two notches more pathetic than going to a Frank Zappa show to pick up chicks . Really , what kind of girls get turned on by a song called ' Zombie Eaters ' ? I guess that would be cool in one way , but I ' d be a little wary of what kind of other freaky shit she ' s into . I wish I ' d thought of that before I joined the band .
