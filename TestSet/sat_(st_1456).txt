" I can ' t think of anywhere else I would rather be today , " said ICU nurse Kimberly Williamson . " I heard almost everyone else is at home eating turkey , stuffing , and gobs of other food , while laying on sofas watching football . That doesn ' t appeal to me , so I would much rather be here at work Oh Mr Johnson stop trying to pull your ET tube out for the 50th time or I ' ll have to restrain you ! "
