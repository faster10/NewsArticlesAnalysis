Taking the usual estimate of the Muslim population in the United States of 2 . 35 million , this would mean the FBI has a spy for every 200 Muslims in the United States . When one adds the resources of the National Security Agency , regional intelligence fusion centers , and the counterterrorism work of local police departments , such as the New York Police Department ( where a thousand officers are said to work on counterterrorism and intelligence ) , the number of spies per Muslim may increase dramatically . East Germany ' s communist era secret police , the Stasi , had one intelligence analyst or informant for every 66 citizens . This suggests that Muslims in the United States could be approaching levels of state surveillance similar to that which the East German population faced from the Stasi .
