And anyone that knows Ben Jerry understands their political leanings are much more progressive than Christie ' s . I think the governor thought it would be easy to fly on over here after the New Hampshire endorsement and slow down the Bernie Sanders train . Well , we ' re not New Hampshire , and that ' s not going to happen . "
