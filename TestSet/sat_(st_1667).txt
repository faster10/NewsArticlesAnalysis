The October 26th attempt to air the episode , " Girls Gone Wilder " , failed after the preceding NFL game ran over on the East Coast . CBS showed West Coast viewers a repeat episode of the crime drama instead of the intended new episode . However , a second attempt to air the same episode on November 2nd , also failed , again due to a NFL game running long . The episode was reportedly shown to viewers on the West Coast but the East Coast and Central time broadcast was postponed for the second week in a row .
