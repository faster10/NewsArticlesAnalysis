1 . Russell Wilson ' s 35 yard pass to Tyler Lockett : With 13 : 02 left , Wilson set up in shotgun with the ball at the Minnesota 39 . He was trying to change the play at the line of scrimmage , but center Patrick Lewis thought Wilson was calling for the snap . Lewis fired the ball back , and it flew over Wilson ' s left shoulder . Wilson had to retreat roughly 11 yards and even dropped down to the ground to pick the ball up at one point . He had five defenders closing in , but rose to his feet , scrambled to his right and bought some time . He then fired downfield to a wide open Lockett near the Vikings ' 28 yard line . Lockett raced to his left and got all the way down to the Vikings ' 4 yard line . The Seahawks scored their only touchdown of the game two plays later . It ' s the type of play that might be forgotten had the Seahawks lost . But now it will be considered one of the greats in franchise history .
