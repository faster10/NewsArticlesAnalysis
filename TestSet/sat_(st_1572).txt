Carson said when he sent Santa his wish list in early November , he had no way of knowing that the majority of his staff would no longer be part of his campaign . " It ' s eerie , " admitted Carson , " but it ' s like Santa knows my every move . Like he has someone working here on the inside , feeding him information about what I need and when I need it . Sometimes I think Santa knows me better than I know myself . "
