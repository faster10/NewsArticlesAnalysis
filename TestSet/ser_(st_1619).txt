AK : Being a Muslim and being a Pakistani a lot of people are going to bring that issue up . I ' m flying the flag for Britain and Pakistan , I ' m proud to be British and British Pakistani , and I think there ' s a lot of people , Muslim people , just like me . So , when you do get a lot of people talking about terrorism and stuff like that , it ' s only a very small percentage . There ' s a bigger picture out there and I want people to follow my footsteps and do what I ' m doing .
