Many feminist groups criticized Michael for his disciplinary techniques . Shanda Moore of Women ' s Power Alliance had this to say in regards to the matter . " This is slut shaming , pure and simple . What this man did was abuse . He should not be trying to harness his daughters sexuality and manipulate it in the direction that he sees fit . It ' s perverse and horrific . I would not be surprised if she was now suffering PTSD after this . If she ever feels the need to reach out and escape her abusers we will be here to help her . "
