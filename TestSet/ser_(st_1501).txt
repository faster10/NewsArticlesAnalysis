And of course , there is the gender thing . Contrary to what some folks say , I don t mindlessly support ? people based on their genitalia , or else I would support Carly Fiorina or Sarah Palin or even Clinton 08 . ( I voted for Obama in the primaries and would do it again , because he was what we needed at that time . ) But all other things being equal , yes , having a woman president does matter , if only to spend election night ? watching the spreading urine stains on the pants of the men who spent months lecturing feminists about how we re wrong to want to break the stranglehold of power men have had on the White House .
