" My daughter is a single mom , so I have even kept ( my grandson ) ' occupied ' for a few minutes while she got dinner started or put a load of laundry in , " Tucker says . " I like my iPad because it ' s so portable and easy to use . I have shown him an interesting bug on our deck , what the new carpet looks like , and how high the snow is at our house . My own kids were raised with long distance grandparents , and there is little comparison to the advantages we have now . "
