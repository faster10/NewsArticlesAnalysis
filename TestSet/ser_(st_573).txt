The Fox Business Network set some rather strange guidelines for inclusion into both of their upcoming debates ( for both the main event and the " kids ' table " undercard debate ) . I mean , I do applaud them for beginning the winnowing process , but at the same time I wonder why they set both of their inclusion division lines right in the middle of two groups of candidates , instead of in the gaps between the groups ( which would make more sense ) . There are five candidates with virtually no chance of becoming the Republican nominee at this point , but for some reason only three of them were cut from the kids ' table debate . Jim Gilmore didn ' t even get to go to the last undercard debate , so it ' s no surprise he won ' t be appearing this time either . George Pataki and Lindsey Graham also didn ' t make the Fox Business Network cut . Maybe the three of them can get together to watch the debate , and issue angry tweets all the while , or something .
