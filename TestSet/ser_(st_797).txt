Well , I wrote actually last August ? I mean , what Rich is saying in National Review is not news . I wrote Trump is the strongman we don t need August of last year , and since then , have worked to try and find alternatives . Guess what , we don t have any . And whose fault is that ? I think a lot of the fault actually belongs to the conservative intellectual leadership of America that you see in this issue of National Review . With the conservative cause that animates the Republican Party , we don t appeal to young people , we don t appeal to millennials , we don t appeal to young women , we don t appeal to minorities . We appeal to only cranky old white guys like me who end up voting for Donald Trump .
