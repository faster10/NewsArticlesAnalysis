As I ve said since the CNBC debate , the best way to improve the overall quality of the debate was to ? reduce the number of participants , so reducing the main stage to eight candidates should actually allow the reporters to get detailed responses from the candidates , assuming they ve learned something from the horrible time management that the CNBC moderators did , which ? made that debate an overall disaster . The undercard debate will likely get more attention than it has in the past because of the presence of Huckabee and Christie this time around , but in all honesty the fact that they have fallen into the same tier as candidates who barely register in the polls can only be bad news for their respective campaigns , notwithstanding whatever effort they make to try to spin it any other way . The same can be said for Graham and Pataki , both of whom had been part of each of the three previous undercard debates . In the end , though , those debates have become less and less relevant since the first debate on Fox News debate in August and it seems hardly relevant whether they would be there or not .
