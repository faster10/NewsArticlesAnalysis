MF : First of all , thank you so much for inviting me and having me here . So , first of all , why did that happen ? That happened because we have failed to understand the dynamics that are occurring in the middle east and the international relationships that we ve had over many many years have not gotten to a point where we are strong enough as an international body to face this very very determined threat that we re facing . I think that we have to understand , there are going to be more of these instances , and I think that the leaders of these nations that are in this so called international coalition have to understand how we re going to deal with this type of extremists because we don t want these incidents that are going to happen , we do not want them to be the cause of something greater that we re already facing .
