EMT first responder Richard Avis described the scene : " We had to carry him out sitting in a chair since he couldn ' t stand up . He was a little embarrassed , but things like this pop up all the time these days with all the boner pills out there . " This was not the first time Avis transported a celebrity to a hospital . " We once had to accompany a private ambulance from the Cardinal ' s residence . They drove so fast to the emergency room , we almost got a ticket trying to beat the bishop . "
