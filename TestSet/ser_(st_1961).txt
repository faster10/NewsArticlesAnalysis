I have watched long enough and held my tongue long enough to give him the benefit of the doubt , but can no longer say this is a witch hunt , " a lynching " to use his word , or any other euphemism . There are allegations out there that matter and they have stacked up . For we who led the charge against Bill Clinton on a number of related issues to continue to blame the media or other campaigns or say it simply doesn ' t matter makes us the hypocrites as well .
