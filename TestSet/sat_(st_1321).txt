Darren Mitchell continues to perform like the 10 time All Star that he is . His streak of 98 consecutive placements within 7 days of admission goes unmatched . Yesterday , he broke another all time record by helping place 8 patients at the same subacute rehabilitation facility . This year ' s rookie social worker with the most upside is Myra West . She sports an impressive collegiate resume and during her first weekend call managed to arrange home health 15 times without a glitch . She may certainly get more playing time if starting social worker Karen Roberts ends up being suspended indefinitely by the league for use of performance enhancing drugs ( PEDs ) . Though that ' s bad news for Roberts , that ' s great news for fantasy owners if West is still available . Hot : Mitchell , West . Not : Roberts .
