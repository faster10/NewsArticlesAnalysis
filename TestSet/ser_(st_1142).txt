2 . Kam Chancellor ' s forced fumble vs . Adrian Peterson : On the Vikings ' ensuing offensive possession , they ran a play fake to Peterson , and then Teddy Bridgewater dumped it off to him in the flat . Linebacker K . J . Wright charged forward and grabbed a hold of Peterson ' s left arm . Chancellor then lowered his shoulder , got both hands on the ball and ripped it out of Peterson ' s hands . Perhaps the part about this play that Pete Carroll will most appreciate is that defensive tackle Ahtyba Rubin ended up making the recovery . The coaches have praised Rubin for his hustle in recent weeks . He ' s normally charged with stopping the run , but hustled downfield and was in the right place at the right time . The Seahawks ended up kicking what turned out to be the game winning field goal on their next possession .
