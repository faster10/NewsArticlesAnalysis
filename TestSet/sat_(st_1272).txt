" It couldn ' t be any simpler , " explains Troy LeDouche , a methadrone subscriber . " Before , I had to arrange a ride to clinic or spend hours of my day schlepping around on the bus . Now , I just get that monthly payment in , and walk out the front door every day at 11 : 00 . No need to shower or get presentable . I am back in the house and watching It ' s Always Sunny in Philadelphia reruns by 11 : 05 . I haven ' t put on pants in three months . "
