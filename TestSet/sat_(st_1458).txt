" The patients will love it , " assured Mrs Gudell . " We ' ll sedate them adequately before requesting they lick a frog in the OR . Those with larger tongues , who might otherwise be more difficult intubations , will naturally cover more frog surface area with a lick , so we don ' t even have to use math and calculate dosages for adequate muscle relaxation . Best of all , if the patients lick a frog twice , Dr Foster will finally get the complete paralysis he demands for skin closure . "
