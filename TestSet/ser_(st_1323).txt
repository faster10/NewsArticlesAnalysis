Lue essentially has this job right now because of LeBron ' s influence in the organization . Either directly or indirectly , James ' lack of acceptance of Blatt over the past year and a half led to Lue becoming the new coach in the middle of a fairly successful season . Not to mention , LeBron is the best player on the team and maybe the best player in the world , so deferring to him and his playmaking brilliance isn ' t a bad idea . Lue clearly isn ' t afraid to come out and give sound bytes that are criticial of his team , which is something Blatt seemed to waffle on doing from time to time .
