You cowboy haters are idiots . Tony Romo will be better then ever next season . Draft a corner back to take carrs spot . Draft a pass rusher that can actually sack the qb . Draft Doug free replacement . Cause god damn he sucks this year . Or maybe go bring back bill cahahan . To get this oline playing like they should be like last year . McFadden has be fine he has looked great at making the oline look better . Draft a wide receiver cut Terrence Williams or trade him . Qb can wait play Kellon Moore cause I think we got something here
