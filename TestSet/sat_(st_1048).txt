" If the caller cannot answer all of these questions correctly , they are told to hang up and call back once all requirements are met . In the exceedingly rare instance that a caller can penetrate both the automated and live answering service , their message will be relayed to the PA , who will then call back after at least 2 hours elapse . Once the PA and caller are connected , the PA will obtain the necessary information and request , then promise to relay it to Dr Carson and call back after another 120 minute mandatory waiting period .
