Does black talent matter ? ? I ve been disturbed by the way some have framed this debate , that black folk have once again been victimized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences . ? There is no doubt that throughout U . S . ? history , the suffering of black people has been rendered invisible , politically , economically and socially . But for an industry that has the power to tell stories about the human condition , stories that can both empower and entertain , I see a lot of black writing , directing , producing and acting talent being ignored by the decision makers .
