Prune says Apple is developing their EBT app in what he defines as an act of charity and thoughtfulness . " We know that at least a quarter of a million Apple Watch owners will get our product through the Obama Phone program in 2015 and 2016 , so we asked ourselves , hey , how will this product benefit those users specifically ? ' So that ' s how Apple EBT was born . We wanted to develop an app exclusively for the Obama Phone users , and make it something that could improve their lives . "
