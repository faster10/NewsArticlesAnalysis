" People suck sometimes , " McCutchen said , shoveling no less than fifty medical textbooks onto the growing fire . " I was trained to diagnose and treat diseases . But you know what I did half of the time ? I said , No , I won ' t give you Dilaudid ' or No , I won ' t write for IV Benadryl ' before getting yelled at promptly . They don ' t teach you in med school how to call security or have a patient leave against medical advice . And what ' s with those patients who throw their feces ? Never again . "
