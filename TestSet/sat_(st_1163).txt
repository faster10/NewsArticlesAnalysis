" It ' s a funny story actually , " explained Kellerman after emitting a jaw locking yawn . " It ' s so monotonous doing notes so freaking boring . My brain must have shut off . I was on mindless documentation autopilot . You keep typing or writing but not thinking , you know what I mean ? By the time I realized I had written a second note on a patient it was already finalized and signed . Such are notes nowadays . I hope my two notes are similar . "
