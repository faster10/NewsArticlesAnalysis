A team led by University of Nebraska scientists had anticipated this kind of problem in 1996 , when they found that a Brazil nut protein introduced to improve the nutritional quality of genetically modified soybeans was able to provoke an allergic reaction in people with Brazil nut allergies . However , this kind of problem was dismissed by most scientists as very improbable , since it could easily be avoided with proper safety testing . The soybean injected with the Brazil nut gene was indeed abandoned during development , but it seems that the genetically modified tomato that caused Mr Ramos ' death had not been submitted to sufficient testing and the lethal risk had not been identified before it was marketed .
