Alexandria A team of archaeologists and historians from the Polish Center of Archaeology , that were conducting some research in the crypt of an ancient christian church , have revealed a mausoleum made of marble and gold that could well be the long lost tomb of Alexander III of Macedon , who went down in history as Alexander the Great . The site is situated in an area known as Kom el Dikka in the heart of downtown Alexandria , only 60 meters away from Mosque of Nebi Daniel , where Arabic tradition maintained the tomb was to be found and where many excavations had already been conducted .
