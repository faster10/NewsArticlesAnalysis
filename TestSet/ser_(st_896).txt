Let ' s talk to Jon Karl about all this . Closing in on those first votes in Iowa , Jon , every single day counts and trump did win the news cycle with that Sarah Palin endorsement but what about the argument that president Obama is to blame for track Palin assaulting his girlfriend . Reporter : In politics that ' s what we call a stretch . I ' ve seen Barack Obama blamed for a lot of things . I never imagined when the story broke that Sarah Palin ' s son was charged with domestic violence that somehow this would be Obama ' s fault . But , look , you know , Palin brings a lot of baggage but there is no question this endorsement is still a very big deal for trump and you can see that in the reactions from the other candidates . They have all came out in response and praised Sarah Palin , even Jeb bush yesterday was saying nice things about Sarah Palin because she has influence with those conservatives in Iowa . Talk about things you never imagined . The former senate majority leader Robert dole saying that Donald Trump would be a better president than a republican senator , Ted Cruz . You ' ve got the establishment seeming to choose trump over Cruz right now . Is that a problem for Cruz or an opportunity ? Reporter : Well , look , the establishment attacks have not hurt at all throughout this campaign . But I think this may be different because it helps trump make an argument that he is more electable . That ' s been the biggest challenge for trump is whether or not he can win in November . So if you have establishment figures like the governor of Iowa , like bob dole saying that he is more electable than Ted Cruz I think that actually helps trump and hurts Cruz . One of the other dynamics you ' re seeing with all this focus on trump and Cruz all the other candidates getting drowned out . Reporter : Absolutely . Marco Rubio , should be a great opportunity for him , the two front runners are beating it out but he can ' t get a word in edgewise . Thanks very much .
