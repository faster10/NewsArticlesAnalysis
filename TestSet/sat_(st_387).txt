Brukenheimer does manage to terrorize the children on days other than Halloween . In his basement , surrounded by dripping pipes and the far off screams of long lost dental patients , he keeps his plaster dental molds . Some hang creepily , ghastly wind chimes suspended from twine and stirring in a wind whose source is unknown but doubtlessly infernal . Some are on his workbench , surrounded by various pointy instruments of torture . Yet others are packed in boxes , waiting to be opened and experimented on .
