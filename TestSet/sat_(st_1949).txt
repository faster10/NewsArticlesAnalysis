Now that Rivers has passed , these same people are not only celebrating , but taking credit for it as well . On the now deleted Twitter account , the ISIS leader wrote , " Praise be to Allah who has cast the vulgar American , Joan Rivers , into the deepest pit of Jahannam as punishment for her vile insults towards Islam . All who choose to degrade our religion will ultimately suffer the same fate . Praise be to him for wiping this obscene abomination off the face of the earth ! "
