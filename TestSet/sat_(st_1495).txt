" Rick will move the church away from the strict letter of Jesus ' teachings of taking care of the poor , " said State Rep . Tom Thompaulsen , a long time friend and supporter of Santorum , " and toward a more looser interpretation where we may not worship the job creators per se , but we certainly acknowledge that God must truly love them more , since they have more stuff , you see .
