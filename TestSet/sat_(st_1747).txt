" What I love about Trump is that he tells it like it is , " Wizard Garrison told the press after the impromptu Trump rally , " even if how he ' s telling it isn ' t exactly true . " Garrison said he knew as soon as Trump referred to Mexican immigrants as mostly being " rapists , " " killers , " and " drug dealers " that he was the one Garrison wanted to win the nomination . He told reporters that he was " tired of all the wishy washy , dog whistle racism of the GOP " and wanted to stop " pussy footin ' around with the uppity blacks who think they ' re still entitled to equal treatment under the law .
