Meanwhile , all along the way , we were also being asked to surrender a certain degree of authority over our own devices . Part of the reason Apple products work so well is that they are closed to our intervention . Unlike Microsoft PC ' s , early Apple products only worked with Apple made peripherals . That ' s why Apple machines never ( or very rarely ) had conflicts or crashes . They weren ' t trying to accommodate everybody else ' s printers and modems and drivers . Likewise , Apple iPhones are closed systems . Unless we " jailbreak " our phones , software and content must be purchased from Apple . The iPhone ' s capabilities are similarly limited to activities that Apple deems appropriate and profitable for itself and its partners .
