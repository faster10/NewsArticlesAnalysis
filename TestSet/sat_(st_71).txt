" We were walking on the beach , and we saw something protruding from the sand " says park ranger Ignacio Ramirez . " We dug it out and found a bunch of old wooden chests . They were all filled with gold and silver ! Then we dug out two incredible golden statues of the Virgin Mary , and other religious symbols . We called our bosses and said ' we just found a treasure ! ' . They thought we were kidding , but we explained what we had found and they decided a team of experts . "
