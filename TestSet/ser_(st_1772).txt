A mass e mail to relatives and networking contacts is fine , too just keep it brief , say nothing but classy things about your former employer , and be prepared to write a battery of " Thanks , yeah , I ' m excited ! " responses when your e mail hits peeps ' inboxes . ( If your exit was less , er , voluntary , the same principles apply : " celebratory " drinks become " commiseration " cocktails , and the mass e mail becomes more of a polite plea for networking leads . )
