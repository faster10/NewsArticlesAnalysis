Subir Rakesh , a graduating medical student from Arkansas , is concerned about the intense competition for entry into the revolutionary program . " It takes more than boards scores and a high GPA to get into this field , " says Rakesh . " I ' m just hoping I can make an impression during the interview by demonstrating some retractor techniques I ' ve learned over the years . You know , the overhand , the sidebar , the through and through , the inverted Hasselhoff , the French horn . And of course the full extension ski pole . That ' s where your hand is in the surgical field but your head is almost under the table . Very tricky . "
