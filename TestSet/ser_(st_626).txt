No situation was more infamous than when the Bears had a first and goal near the five yard line . Three consecutive passes by quarterback Jay Cutler led to a fourth and goal with the Bears trailing 17 9 . A touchdown and a two point conversion is needed to tie things up , while a field goal would draw them closer with plenty of time left on the clock . The usually conservative John Fox opted to go for the touchdown , but the Bears attempt was nullified by the Broncos . That was perhaps the defining moment of the game .
