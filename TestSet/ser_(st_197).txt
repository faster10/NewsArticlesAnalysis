Because their work ethics are so legendary , the willfully ignorant fan inside me has always wanted to believe that such dedication would allow them to consciously shape their career trajectories . If any two players could dictate their finishes , could end their careers in manners befitting everything they ve accomplished , it had to be these two . And yet as these past few weeks have demonstrated , that is simply not the case . Bryant and Manning now look like two people whose willingness to test the misinformed notion that athletes can overcome any and all travails through hard work , even aging , gave them acute tunnel vision . They look like two athletes who should have retired months ago and spared themselves , their teammates , and fans from the sad spectacle of watching them struggle . ?
