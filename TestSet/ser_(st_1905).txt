This is the first time they ve ever had the ( NFC ) Championship Game there . I know how that was in 2008 for us . Our crowd was unbelievable , the craziest I d ever seen it because that was our first time , Campbell said . But I feed off the crowd , even when it s the other team s crowd . So I m looking forward to it . I m looking forward to a hostile environment out there and try to do what we do .
