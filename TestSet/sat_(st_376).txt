" I figure I ' ll eventually end up being a blog watcher for MySpace , " said Talbert . " I ' d pretty much be in charge of keeping an eye on various MySpace pages throughout the day , but if they expect me to do that for more than a few minutes a day , that ' s total bullshit and I won ' t even apply . I ' m going to need at least five hours today alone to look for this one video I saw once where a dog craps right on a cat ' s face . "
