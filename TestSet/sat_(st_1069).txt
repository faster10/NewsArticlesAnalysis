The post call resident in question was not able to be reached for a comment . However , a spokesperson from the hospital cites " long hours , too many patients , and poor hygiene among residents as contributing factors to today ' s quarantine . He states , " Too many residents think they can just go days without showering and nobody will notice . We gave them a pamphlet at the beginning of residency about showering and deodorant . We even gave them a goody bag with sample sized personal hygiene products , just like you get in puberty class in middle school but some of them refuse to acknowledge this serious issue . It ' s a shame too see so many go down that path . "
