" He was someone that I was very close to and whenever he came into a room , you knew he was there and he always kept it real light and he knew when it was time to get down to business , " Love said . " Not only sad for his family and Minnesota and the Timberwolves and the community there but for the basketball community in general . We lost a really good one . My prayers are with his family . It ' s tough . It ' s tough . "
