One possible reason for Bowie s retreat from the spotlight at this time : rampant speculation suggesting his health was in decline . While Bowie never spoke about it to the press , his longtime musical partner Tony Visconti told The Hollywood Reporter in 2013 , We all know he had a health scare . I hate to hear it described as a major heart attack ? it was not a major heart attack ? but he had surgery in 2004 and he s been healthy ever since . Gibbons tells EW of an encounter with Bowie in upstate New York a few years later : He had told me about the heart attack he had ? but he seemed terrific . Despite Bowie s hiatus from recording , he kept busy , guesting on the Ricky Gervais series Extras and curating the inaugural High Line Festival in New York .
