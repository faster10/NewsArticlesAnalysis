The Giants will give the Pats secondary problems . Odell Beckham Jr . is as good as advertised . He can get after the rock and run like a deer . The team will have to lock him down and then take their chances with New York s other threats . Eli Manning gets rid of the ball quickly and that may make the New England pass rush obsolete . The Pats will have to get their hands up in the passing lane and knock Eli s passes down . Shane Vereen will pose somewhat of a problem , especially because the Pats will probably play this week without Jamie Collins . But I think they will be able to overcome that .
