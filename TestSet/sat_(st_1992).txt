WASHINGTON , D . C . Outgoing Speaker of the House John Boehner prided himself on the job he did while leading the Republican party in the House of Representatives . Perhaps more accurately , he prided himself on the job he did not do . Boehner famously quipped once that the body that is in charge of writing the nation ' s laws should not be judged by how many laws they pass , but by how many laws they repeal . Just moments after his press conference Friday afternoon , Boehner was asked by a reporter on his way to his office what he planned to do once the Ohio Republican leaves office next month .
