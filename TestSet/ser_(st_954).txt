JAMIE CARRAGHER : We used to love small strikers like Robbie Fowler or Michael Owen , but now it is all about the men who can lead the line on their own . Falcao is one of them , a forward with real presence who will score goals . Ever since his superb performance for Atletico Madrid against Chelsea in the Super Cup two seasons ago , I thought he would move to one of Europe ' s giants . It was a waste playing in the French league because a player of that quality needs to be somewhere better .
