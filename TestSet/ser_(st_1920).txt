I ve found myself thinking repeatedly about this disparity over the past couple of days , as the anti Muslim climate in the United States has reached new heights and as Donald Trump has begun conducting what even some conservatives ? describe as a fascist campaign . How , I wonder , would the American media cover some other country ? in South America , say , or the Middle East ? where leading presidential candidates explicitly stirred up hatred against an already demonized minority group and cheered on the beating of protesters at their events or where armed gangs patrolled outside faith centers and leading businesses sanctioned religious discrimination ?
