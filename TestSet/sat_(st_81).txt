The rumors of Paul ' s death began more than 45 years ago , but had always been dismissed as nonsense by the band and its entourage . In September 1969 , American college students published a series of articles in which they claimed that clues to McCartney ' s death could be found among the lyrics and artwork of the Beatles ' recordings . Clue hunting rapidly proved infectious , and within a few weeks , it had become an international phenomenon . Rumours only declined after a contemporary interview with McCartney was published in Life magazine in November 1969 .
