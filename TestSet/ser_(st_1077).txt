Of course , being reminded that the Stones have been around for five decades is almost unnecessary . The band hasn ' t had a Top 10 hit in over 20 years , but whether we want it to or not , it never seems to have gone away . From Keith Richards ' garrulous best selling 2010 memoir , to Maroon 5 ' s " Moves Like Jagger , " to Jagger himself hosting " Saturday Night Live " this year , the culture always seems to circle around to the Stones just when you ' d think we ' d all had enough of them .
