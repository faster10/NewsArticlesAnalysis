ROTT : No , not really . I mean , obviously , there ' s a lot of speculation . But at the press conference just earlier this afternoon , the city ' s police chief , mayor and even Colorado ' s governor say they ' re not ready to give out any possible motives yet . That said , the mayor , John Suthers , told reporters earlier today that people could make their own inferences based on where the attacks took place . Some people have taken that to mean that the clinic was targeted because of Planned Parenthood ' s role in providing abortion services and the heightened debate that ' s been going on over some controversial videos about Planned Parenthood that were released earlier this summer . Though we should say , that ' s still very tenuous and at this point certainly not confirmed . Even Planned Parenthood , for its part , says that it doesn ' t know if the clinic was , in fact , the target of the attack .
