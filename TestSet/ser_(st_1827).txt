He s not a conservative in the sense that Ronald Reagan was . This is why I m very careful to say that while I think he is very similar to Ronald Reagan in ways , he isn t Ronald Reagan . One of the things that I don t take particularly seriously is that they say he supported Democrats and all this sort of thing Ronald Reagan went through that faze as well . I think that Donald Trump is a different kind of conservative . You can t , for example , build the Trump Organization , and I m not talking about his political stuff , I m talking about his business , which is called the Trump Organization , you can t do that without being a small c conservative . You ve got to have some common sense about you . Otherwise , the whole thing will go under .
