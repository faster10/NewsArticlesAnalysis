The Germans have high taxes , they have lots of regulations , they have strong unions and yet they ' ve seen their imports increase year after year . They ' ve weathered the economic crisis very well , they ' ve had 15 months of falling unemployment numbers , and why is that ? Because they have really focused on scientific education , technical education , apprenticeship programs , retraining . They focus on high end manufacturing , they train and retrain their workers . We don ' t have any such systems in America . We need there to be more of a coordinated effort by government , business and educational institutions a triangle of training .
