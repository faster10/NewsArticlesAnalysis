Like most Americans , I had little knowledge of these campaign laws including how the Washington insiders passed them , interpreted them and enforced them . I have spent my adult life as an electrical engineer in the Birmingham , Alabama , area where I grew up and eventually created a small business that has fewer than two dozen employees . I was too busy for politics until five years ago , at age 42 , when I joined many other Americans who were disenchanted by what they saw in Washington and decided to take action .
