Guiliano : You have to apply a few commonsense tricks . At most of those parties , the food is not that great to start with , so don ' t go hungry and starving . Have two tablespoons of a yogurt or a sliver of cheese or a few nuts or a hard boiled egg or an apple before you go , so you ' re not starving , and then try not to be too close to the food . Or look at all the food and pick two or three things you like and just have small portions , small bites . . . . People in America , in the Anglo Saxon world , tend to say " no bread . " You can have a little bit of everything . It ' s all about moderation and balance .
