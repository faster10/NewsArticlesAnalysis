" I ' m just so thankful to the one , true , American God for this opportunity I got , " Boehner said , visibly holding back tears , " because it ' s an honor to serve your country in such a capacity . It ' s an honor to decry and demagogue the poor for taking money and alleging they don ' t work for it while literally doing the exact same thing , and I just couldn ' t be more proud of my tenure and all the accomplishments I didn ' t achieve . God Bless America , God Bless the Republican Party , and God Bless me ! "
