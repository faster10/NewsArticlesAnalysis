But some fans aren ' t going to be thrilled when they hear the concept . Paul Horner , 35 , a comic book store owner in Tuscon , Arizona vowed on his podcast Tuesday morning that he will boycott all of Abrams ' projects until he publicly promises not to make the film . " Star Wars and Star Trek can ' t be crossed over . They just can ' t . It ' s an abomination to even consider it . The only thing these two franchises have in common is that both occasionally take place in space . To even have this thought cross his mind should be enough to make JJ Abrams give up in the film industry entirely and go work a construction job someplace . "
