Regarding who signs the prescription , Anderson stated : " The prescription is signed by the on site nurse practitioner or physician assistant , the medicine is filled by a pharmacist on the fly with a new policy of " close enough " for counting , and the patient then drives to the next window to pick it up . At no point is any patient inconvenienced to get out of their vehicle for an exam . It ' s elegant simplicity in action . Patients want convenience , and at Clinimax , that is exactly what they get . American patients know what they need to feel better , so we give it to them quickly and let them get on with their day . "
