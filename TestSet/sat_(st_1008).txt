Sneezy ' s lawyer , Gloria Allred , chimed in , " My client , Sneezy , has filed this suit out of desperation . Over the years , Sneezy has lost productivity , quality of life , and has had an inability to find a mate due to his sneezing related medical condition . He placed his trust in his friend and colleague , Doc , to properly treat this awful disease . Based on this breach of trust , my client is outraged . Unable to reach a fair financial settlement , we were left with no option but to seek justice in the legal system to rectify this physician ' s callous and repeated incompetence . "
