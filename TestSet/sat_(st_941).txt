Dora the Malingerer still interacts with her viewers . In the pilot , she asks : " We need to go see a primary care doctor . Where do we go first : a primary care doctor ' s office or the ER ? The ER , right . " In another episode , she asks : " My EF is only 5 , so which path should I take : the one lined with DNR forms or the one lined with ventilators and defibrillators ? Sometimes her questions are just uncomfortable for the viewer : " Can I stay with you just one night ? I need a place to sleep and eat . Please ? . "
