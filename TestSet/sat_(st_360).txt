" Pre tensioned concrete is so pedantic , " said the artful designer . " Anyone can design a bridge that ' s going to last 100 years , but it takes someone like me with a more long sighted point of view to give each pedestrian or driver who crosses my bridge a moment of self realization and reflection upon their own mortality . Everyone knows that this life is fleeting , but a moment of true realization is hard to come by , and that ' s exactly what I try to do with every bridge I under design for aerodynamic stability . "
