Sadly , there have been a few complaints . Angela Wilson , a local woman who spent 20 minutes visiting her mother Joan Schwartz , found herself frustrated by the level of noise . " I was on my iPad ignoring mom when I kept hearing I ' m clear ! You ' re clear ! Everybody ' s clear . " ' wafting from an adjacent room . I ' m not sure if they ' re Scientologists or practicing a dance routine over there or what but it was noisy and almost gave me a headache . I thought I was going to have to sign in myself and then they ' d have been sorry , I ' m a really hard stick . "
