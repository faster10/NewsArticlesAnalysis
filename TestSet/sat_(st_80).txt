" We felt guilty about the deception " added Ringo Starr . " We wanted to tell the world the truth , but we were afraid of the reactions it would provoke . We thought the whole planet was going to hate us for all the lies we had told , so we kept lying but sending subtle clues to relieve our cousciousness . When the first rumors finally began about the whole thing , we felt very nervous and started fighting a lot with each other . At some point , it was too much for John and he decided to leave the band . "
