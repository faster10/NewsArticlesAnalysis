The Pittsburgh Steelers traveled to Arrowhead Stadium to face the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday . Call it a trap game or just a disappointing overall performance the Steelers left the stadium after a 23 13 loss , falling to 4 3 on the season . With Landry Jones at quarterback , the Steelers offense struggled to be consistent , especially in the passing game . The defense played stingy in the first half only to see a lack of pressure and proper tackling technique allow Alex Smith to hook up with Travis Kelce . In a game of two halves , the Steelers did not have momentum on their side and three turnovers killed a chance at a possible win .
