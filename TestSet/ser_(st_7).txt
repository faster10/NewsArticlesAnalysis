Indeed , political correctness makes it impossible for Democrats to face , head on , by name , the essential problem : the rise of Islamic radicalism ? or jihadi ism , as Hillary Clinton tried to call it ( and almost succeeded ) . This is not just a word game . If we are to come to terms with Da esh and Al Qaeda and other jihadis , we have to acknowledge that they represent a basic conflict within Islam : the rise of Wahhabi style fundamentalism over the past century . If we recognize the nature of this battle , it becomes easier for us to identify our friends and enemies , especially the latter . Our enemies are those who have funded and promulgated Wahhabi style Islam through radical Madrasas throughout the Middle East . That would be Saudi Arabia , whose tottering monarchy made a devil s bargain with the Wahhabis decades ago . In recent weeks , the Saudis and their gulf allies , have turned their attention away from ISIS and focused on the Shi a rebels in Yemen , who represent a far less potent threat to global stability ( even though they are supported by Iran ) . And yet , Saudi Arabia ? and Wahabi style Islam ? was not mentioned by any of the candidates last night .
