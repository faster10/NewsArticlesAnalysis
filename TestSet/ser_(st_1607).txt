Bowie himself very nearly went too far in writing on the jacket that William Boyd s description of Tate s working procedure is so vivid that it convinces me that the small oil I picked up on Prince Street , New York , in the late Sixties must indeed be one of the lost Third Panel Triptychs . The great sadness of this quiet and moving monograph is that the artist s most profound dread ? that God will make you an artist but only a mediocre artist ? did not in retrospect apply to Nat Tate .
