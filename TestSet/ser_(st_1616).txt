Travelling down the western coast of India . We travelled down from Mumbai and into Goa and then much further down into Kerala . I loved Kerala fresh coconut juice every day ! The train system in India is chaotic and fun it ' s the best way to see the landscape . Being in with all the families and also being the odd animal is a colourful experience you ' ll never forget . I would love to go to the Himalayas and cross over into Nepal to do the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway .
