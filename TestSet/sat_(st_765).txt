Gregory Shaft , PhD , head of Embarrassment Research for InSANE , highlights the widespread hospital practice of asking patients for their date of birth . " This is a classic nanoagression , in that it reminds patients of their age and seeks to verbally place them in a position of weakness . " This deeply disturbing practice is repeated throughout a typical hospital admission , beginning at registration , prior to bedside procedures , in the operating room , and even at discharge . In some extreme cases , the patient ' s date of birth is loudly and publically announced in the operating room in the presence of the surgeon , anesthesiologist , nurses , and many others .
