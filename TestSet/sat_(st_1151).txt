Thank Goodness it ' s Freaky Friday ( TGIFF ) at CMMC . Featured services offered for TGIFF are discounted Involuntary Commitments ( IVC ) along with free Haldol and 50 off on Geodon thereby creating an affordable and relaxing cocktail for those inconvenient psychotic breaks . Ativan and xanax candies are the featured snacks of the day and will even be available to anorexics although in the low calorie and reduced sugar form . Anxiety and panic attacks are welcomed on TGIFF and each patient will receive their own take home paper bag rebreather and Ketamine nebulizer for that uncomfortable hyperventilation discomfort .
