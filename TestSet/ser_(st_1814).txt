Start by watching Louis C . K ' s stand up Live at the Beacon Theater ( also on Netflix ) then plough on into this series . It sees the comedian play a semi autobiographical version of himself gigging , raising his two kids and trying to cope with the world of dating far later in life than he expected to . It doesn ' t pack a high laughs per minute ratio , but that ' s not really what he ' s going for in this series . It ' s more Woody Allen territory really ( indeed he went on to star in Blue Jasmine last year ) , and has a surprising emotional depth . Season 2 is shaky , but worth sticking through for season 3 which is brilliant and incredibly thoughtful .
