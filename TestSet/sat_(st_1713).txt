I harken back to something my mother would tell me back when I was still a little girl : " If you don ' t have anything to hide then there ' s nothing to worry about , sweetie " . It still rings true today , in our advanced society where we have the technology to be able to draw someone ' s blood johnny on the spot . Why so many American ' s hate change we may never know . One thing is assured : This is the future and I am ready .
