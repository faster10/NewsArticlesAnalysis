This shouldn t be too difficult a question to answer . We know Trump isn t a conservative , as the political term of art is currently applied : he is in favor of single payer health insurance , entitlement programs as they now stand ( or enhanced versions of same ) and he may still be very pro choice . Oh , he s also opposed to free trade . Overseas , his policy of bombing the y know out of Islamic radicals has the disadvantage of being slightly behind the curve ? we don t know if he supports a ground assault on ISIS , which is where the rest of the Republican field , and Hillary Clinton , seem headed .
