Trump does this stuff because it makes him look strong in the eyes of his supporters , and if Republicans are going to knock him down , they have to find some way to make him look weak . A crappy best of reel of Trump being Trump that questions his electability doesn t do that ? Jeb Bush ? already went down that route and it accomplished nothing . The problem for the GOP is that Trump feeds off of the establishment s disdain and is surging on anti immigrant sentiment and the gross exploitation of ? fears about ? Muslims in America . So if the Republican establishment goes after him for being too much of a bigot or a xenophobe , they re arguably doing him a favor .
