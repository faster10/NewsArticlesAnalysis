Rose will deliver a magnificent game , for example his 39 point effort against Orlando just last Sunday , and then rave about a screen set for him by a teammate . At the All Star Game in Los Angeles two months ago , when Lenny Kravitz and a smoke machine introduced each player in a Hollywood style opening , Rose gently waved and smiled slightly and quickly walked off the stage , looking somewhat embarrassed by the attention . In a sports era where players love to pull their jersey to celebrate a big basket , Rose pulls no stunts . No chest thumping or fist pumping or shimmy shaking . He does not teach anyone how to Dougie . He leaves the screaming to the fans .
