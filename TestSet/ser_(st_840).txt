Paramount is clearly hoping to build a strong word of mouth foundation which could propel the well reviewed film in the coming weeks , and a rep for the studio tells me that Paramount plans to add a few hundred locations to its run next weekend before breaking into an extra wide release on December 9 ( that is when CinemaScore data will be available ) . Film buffs were apparently interested to see how Scorsese used the 3 D illusion according to Paramount , 75 percent of the film ' s gross came from 3 D screens . ( According to me : a quick Fandango browse reveals that today in New York City theaters , 64 out of 77 showtimes that ' s 83 percent ! are in 3 D . Would that mean that a 75 percent 3 D share is actually disappointing ? )
