The reason why I am acknowledging it and am humbled to join that group is because of the names on that list . . . . To me , the highest honor you can have is when people say you played the game at a high level and you played it at a high level for a long time . To reach a milestone like this , that is consistency . . . . I can ' t even put it into words what an honor it is to say I could shortly be a part of that group .
