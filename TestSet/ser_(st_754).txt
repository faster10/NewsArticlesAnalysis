Sanders has been stressing his war on Wall Street , but now Clinton is lashing out at his health care plan , which is basically universal Medicare . The details are vague . Although he has cheerfully explained how he wants to pay for free public college tuition ( tax Wall Street speculators ) and expand Social Security ( stop capping the payroll tax ) , Sanders is mum on who ll pick up the health care bill . A staff member says they re still tinkering with the details .
