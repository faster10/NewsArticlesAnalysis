I think it ' s too soon . I probably could start doing that , but I don ' t want to get locked into a performance mode with a song , either , until I ' ve taken it a little further down the line . Just talking it through , like we ' re doing now , does help . And it gets me in that mindset . It ' s probably the right time now to start taking it more seriously as far as getting into the studio , especially since I ' m finished producing the show .
