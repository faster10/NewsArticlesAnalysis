Tomorrow , the American College of Gastroenterology ( ACG ) and the American College of Surgeons ( ACS ) will deploy gastroenterologists and general surgeons , respectively , at all 5 airports in order to help the TSA perform the airport colorectal screenings . The TSA is urging that all Americans remain patient during this process , especially when stool guaiac developer levels run low . If travelers have had a routine screening colonoscopy within the past year , they will be asked to provide a copy of the report with their plane ticket and photo identification . Over a 3 month time frame , the ACG and ACS hope to turn over all screening procedures to the TSA .
