Please take a minute to imagine the pain and absolute heartbreak of parents who lose a child to the lure of The Phish 1 . Ponder the anguished nights of clinging to memories of a daughter as an innocent toddler taking her first steps or proudly serving lamp warmed cupcakes from her easy bake oven . Those with sons will ponder his first words , light bright artwork , and maybe a hunting trip or visit to the firing range . All this is of course an escapist reflex condition because their hearts are broken with the realization that their child has thrown his or her life away chasing the dragon of jamband music concerts . Imagine the anguished hours weeping for a lost child . This is exactly the plight of the Christian Family in this edition of " Dear Cassidy . "
