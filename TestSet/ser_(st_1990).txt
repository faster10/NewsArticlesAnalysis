Arieff : I never wanted to exploit anyone and there ' s so much exploitation in India . I definitely wanted to make sure that my surrogate was really on board and wanted to do this and felt empowered as a woman to be doing something to help me and her family . The whole " womb for rent , " that ' s where the medical contract and the business transaction side of things comes in , but after doing my research I felt comfortable that she was helping me because she wanted to and I was helping her . You have to be an advocate for yourself and surrogate and I always made sure she was OK . I wanted her to feel special because for the rest of your life I was going to put her on pedestal .
