In 2005 , I sat on a panel at Columbia University that reviewed the best journalism of the year . One unforgettable news photograph out of a portfolio of 20 showed Iraqi insurgents pulling a man out of a car in midday traffic and shooting him in the head . When we awarded that eyewitness account with a Pulitzer Prize , a chorus of criticism was heaped on the decision . The photo was too disturbing , so they said . How did the photographer just happen to be there ? Couldn ' t he have stopped it ? Wasn ' t he just as bad as the bad guys ?
