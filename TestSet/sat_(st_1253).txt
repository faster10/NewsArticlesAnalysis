This isn ' t the first time nurse Henry has screwed up patients ' baby names . Last week his supervisor told him to get Apple from the nurses station for her . Henry was seen handing over an edible apple , not picking up this hipsters ' baby named Apple . " Henry really needs to get his act together with knowing the latest and greatest baby names . I mean , can you imagine if he had brought the parents a freakin ' apple back instead of their baby ? Automatic negative patient satisfaction score ! "
