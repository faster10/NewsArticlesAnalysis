" Brad kept assuring us that he ' s fine , but there was something he wasn ' t telling us , " said Hibben ' s mother . " He would say things like , ' I get so much stuff done by not watching television , ' which is fine , but can ' t you get stuff done and watch television ? Just because you have it does ' ' t mean you have to watch it all the time , but how will he know who the next American Idol is going to be ? How does he know what ' s going on in the world ? "
