" I used to be so healthy , " explains 5K2C user Tara Roberts , her comments occasionally drowned out by the crunching of Cheetos . " It was terrible . I used to run tons of 5Ks and I used to be so skinny and I ' d have these occasional post run leg aches . But now the legs are no longer aching they ' ve atrophied . My skinniness has been cured , and I ' ve realized how much time I ' ve wasted outside all these years . What am I running away from ? I faced my fears and it feels so great to catch up on The Hunger Games , Orange is the New Black , and Game of Thrones . "
