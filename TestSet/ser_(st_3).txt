I really want to applaud are some other actors , directors and producers who were at the top of their game this year . Gregory Peck , who served as its president from 1967 through 1970 , pored over the membership rolls and redesignated as associate members people who had not worked for many years , most of whom were retired and not especially in tune with the cutting edge of cinematic or social ideas . I m calling this one for Best Supporting Actor because it really is an ensemble film .
