According to UNESCO , 700 , 000 school age children in Malala and Shazia ' s home province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KPK ) are not at school today and 600 , 000 are girls . They are some of the 32 million girls worldwide denied a place at school . In total , 500 million girls of school age will never complete their education . This makes the battle for education for every girl the civil rights struggle of our generation . And until we provide both the resources and security for girls to travel to school and feel safe from the Taliban , then many of Pakistan ' s schools will remain closed .
