" There is far more in common between ISIS and radical Christianity than they ' ll ever admit , " Faber says , " and the simple fact is that keeping the general populace dumb and easily manipulable is a common goal between them . " Faber said that no religion is free from its abusers and that she finds it " extremely comical " when Christians behave as if they don ' t have violence in their past , but also in their most recent history . " Timothy McVeigh was a conservative Christian anti government guy , " Faber said , " and Breivik over in Norway was a Christian . " Faber said she finds it ironic that any religion that has led an Inquisition in the past would find the moral high ground to deny solace for refugees that belong to another religion .
