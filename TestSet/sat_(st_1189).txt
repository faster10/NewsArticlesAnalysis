Before you enter into the room , make sure you gather yourself : close your eyes , take a deep breath , and become one with the situation . Once you wake up , direct Sparky right into the lap of your angry patient . This is a critical juncture so be sure to take the time required to find the cutest and furriest puppy possible . " Who can stay angry at this cute little face ? ? ? ! ! . " Helpful hint : If you do not have access to a puppy , then ( 1 ) ask if the angry patient has pictures of a cute pet , thereby distracting them or ( 2 ) change out of your clothes and don a shirt with the picture of a baby golden retriever or pug . Your love of puppies will win the patient over in no time .
