" Fast forward five and a half years of research , " says a proud Dr McKinley , " and we can now throw out all that liver kidney enzyme nonsense . It ' s clear that the body produces and builds up high levels of these ' toxins , ' which necessitate ' flushing ' by a series of complex and expensive juices . If a person is unable to ' flush ' the ' toxins , ' either due to juice access difficulty or a tragic reliance on out of date medical science , the toxin levels build , eventually resulting in death . It ' s the same reason our neanderthal ancestors died out . Without the ability to create berry spinach parsley or mango romaine jicama juices , the toxin buildup would likely have been fatal . "
