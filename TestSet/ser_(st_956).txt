I d go a step further : it s time for Republicans to cull the Trumpster from the herd . It s time for Republican candidates to answer a reverse version of the question he answered negatively at the first GOP debate : Will you pledge to support the Republican nominee ? ( Trump was then , and may still be , mulling an independent bid for the presidency ) . The question to be answered now , not just by the Republican candidates , but by prominent Republicans in general ? this means you , Reince Priebus : Is Donald Trump a Republican ? or , alternatively , Would you support Trump as the Republican nominee ?
