As grunge and alternative revolutionized music in the 1990s , Bowie was there too , as an artist who was part of the conversation and as a godhead to a new generation of musicians . Some of them became collaborators and friends . Trent Reznor cited Bowie as a major influence , and in 1995 his band Nine Inch Nails toured with Bowie . That s one of those things where I still look back and go , Oh man , that actually really happened , Reznor told EW in 2014 . He came to me and said , I made this difficult album 1995 s Outside with Eno , and we re probably going to bum everybody out because we re just going to play stuff off this record . We re not going to do any hits , because that s what I want to do . I thought that took real courage and conviction . He s the real deal . He s one of those few people who didn t disappoint you when you actually get to know them .
