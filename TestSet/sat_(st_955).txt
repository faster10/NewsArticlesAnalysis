Construction on Birmingham Hospital Fortress began in the early summer and was completed just after Thanksgiving . The hospital was erected on the tallest hill in the countryside to increase visibility against the threat of ambulance advances . Using the blueprint of a medieval castle as a guide , administrators created a central hospital keep that house all hospital personnel , which is then surrounded by a four story tall inner wall with guard towers , a 20 foot thick outer wall , and finally a large 100 foot wide moat containing man eating alligators and sharks . Access to the fortress is through a sterile drawbridge , operated and guarded by a rotating cavalry of interns and medical students .
