" Puck is one of the twenty seven moons that orbits Uranus , " explains MIT astrophysicist Markus O ' Neil . " Every seventeen years or so , Puck closes in on its planet slightly and speeds up , which causes the gravitational pull of the planet to strengthen considerably . We call it Puckering . ' It just so happens that as Halley ' s comet passed Uranus in 2012 , the Puckering ' effect was at its fullest , and Uranus Puckering at that moment may have had catastrophic consequences for us here on Earth .
