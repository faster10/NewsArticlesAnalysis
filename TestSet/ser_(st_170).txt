Family ties among the suspects involved in the attacks have also become apparent . Hasna Aitboulahcen , a woman who blew herself up during the Saint Denis raid Wednesday , was a cousin of alleged mastermind Abaaoud Abdeslam . Abdeslam , who remains at large , is a brother of Ibrahim Abdeslam , who died after shooting at people who were dining in Paris last Friday night . Their other brother , Mohamed Abdeslam , who was not implicated in the deadly acts , told French TV station BFMTV this week that he and his family were hoping their fugitive relative would surrender to authorities .
