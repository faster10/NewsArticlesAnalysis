" I remember as we walked up to the compound that Bin Laden was in and knocked on the door , how nervous I was , " Fiorina said , " but I knew my Seal training would give me what I needed to get through this challenge . I turned and looked into the camera on one of the SEAL ' s helmet and waved to President Obama and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , but they didn ' t look up from some secretive conversation they were having in the Situation Room while they waited for us to do our solemn duty . " Fiorina said that she heard one of the SEAL team members telling another one " POTUS and SecState are just discussing a false flag operation in Libya next year , no biggie . Rest assured , I heard them planning Benghazi from day one . "
