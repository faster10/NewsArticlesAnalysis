What then of the cult of Apple after the death of its own leader , Steve Jobs ? I like Apple products as much as any user , and respect the contributions that Apple under Jobs ' leadership made to the co evolution of human beings and their technologies . But all along I have also been aware of the closed nature of Apple technologies , as well as the leap of faith that has been required to accept Jobs ' promise that doing things in some new way will be " fantastic . " Without Jobs telling us to cross the chasm , will we continue to embrace each of Apple ' s future revolutions in hardware , software or both ?
