" The CIA had already tried to poison Kurt in March 1994 , while he was in Italy , " she claimed . " The press had reported that he was suffering from an overdose induced coma , but he was actually a victim of strychnine poisoning . Kurt refused to make the information public because he was afraid for me and Frances . The papers ta I received , prove that the CIA was behind the poisoning . The government had been trying to kill him for months , and I think they finally got him . Kurt was murdered , and the CIA is behind it ! "
