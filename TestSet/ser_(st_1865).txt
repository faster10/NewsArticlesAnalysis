Tyrod Taylor might be the most underrated quarterback in the NFL right now . Taylor totaled four touchdowns ( three TD passes , one TD run ) against a Texans defense that only gave up two touchdowns during the entire month of November . Taylor ' s biggest play came with under two minutes left in the fourth quarter when he hit Charles Clay for what ended up being the game winning touchdown . Taylor finished with 211 yards passing and 28 yards rushing . The Texans had no answers for Sammy Watkins ( 109 receiving yards ) and LeSean McCoy ( 112 rushing yards )
