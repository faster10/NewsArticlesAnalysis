( Bovill , ID ) " I ' m terrified of clouds " , says chem trail expert , Jack Phillips , as we walk the length of his family ' s rural Idaho property . " In High School I was always preoccupied with my own studies , and dropped out during my freshman year of college . I was fed up with the so called education system and the disinformation they were trying to shove down my throat . Ultimately , I realized that I was better off educating myself . The internet was still in its infancy , with less censorship . Trading information through usenet groups was a popular means of communicating the Government ' s covert actions . This is where I begin learning about chem trails . My ongoing studies have lead me to reveal several discoveries about the Government ' s nefarious tactics against its own citizens . "
