Apple s stock has been in a slump for months , as investors worry that the company won t be able to duplicate last year s growth in sales , which were in the double digit percentages . In an interview , Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said a strong dollar helped reduce revenue , as sales made with foreign currencies abroad convert into fewer dollars . He also said the company isn t concerned about what he characterized as a short term slowing of growth , because it has a large base of customers who can be relied on to buy new devices and pay for other services .
