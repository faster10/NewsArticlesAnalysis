The Dolphins offense still looks horrible , but that didn ' t matter on Sunday because Miami didn ' t really need its offense against human pick six machine , Matt Schaub . Derrick Shelby ' s pick six of Schaub in the second quarter gave the Dolphins a 15 0 lead and ended up being all Miami needed in the win . In sad news for Miami ' s offense , Davante Parker ( 63 yards , 1 TD ) was the only Dolphins receiver who had over five yards in the game .
