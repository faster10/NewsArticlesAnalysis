Urgent dare director Dr Robert Norton sees another advantage : " We will likely see a positive trend in Press Ganey scores . Treat ' em and street ' em ! But of course more critical patients are not seen in the drive thru . We had a man complain of shortness of breath and chest discomfort . His lips and fingers were turning blue and he was sweating . We directed him to the nearest ER 17 miles down the freeway . The poor guy probably just worked out too hard before coming in and needed IV fluids to rehydrate . "
