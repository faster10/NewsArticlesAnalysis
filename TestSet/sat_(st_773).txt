When you ' re in the produce section of a supermarket , what do you do ? Right ! You move to the snack aisle . But in the event you grabbed a banana , you would inspect its exterior in a non suggestive manner . Same theory applies . First , look for any bruising , scars , rashes , hernias , and alien lifeforms . If the patient has a pannus , check between the folds to look for signs of infection , sandwiches , or Princess Leia in a gold bikini . Next , be sure the abdomen has a sticker with a PLU ( product lookup ) code so that he or she scans properly at the check out line . Finally , don ' t forget to intensely inspect and scrutinize the belly button : is it an innie or an outie ? is it pierced ? and if so , where can I get one ?
