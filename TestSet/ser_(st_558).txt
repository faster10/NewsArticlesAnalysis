" Look , there ' s no hiding it . I ' m not a spring chicken anymore . I ' m not 28 . I ' m going to be 38 here in July . But I do think I can contribute , " Rodriguez said last month . " I think I can be a force in the middle lineup , a big right handed bat for our team , but I ' m at a different stage of my career . Is it realistic to go out and hit 40 , 50 home runs ? I don ' t think so . But can I go out and have nights like I did last night and do that several times a week ? I think so . "
