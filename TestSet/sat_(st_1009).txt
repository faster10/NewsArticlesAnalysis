Initial results reveal that over 75 of Status Dramaticus patients improved with just one dose of Normale Saline followed by hospital workers walking away . A second dose of Normale Saline again followed by leaving the room cured upwards of 98 of cases . In fact , after a second dose , those 98 were able to physically walk themselves out of the ER unassisted straight into an awaiting Uber car , which now have preset destinations to other ERs . The other 2 probably had a misdiagnosis of SD and likely had Status Epilepticus ( SE ) . Oops .
