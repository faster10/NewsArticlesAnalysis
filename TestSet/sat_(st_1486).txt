Ashley ' s daily routine involved a strict regimen of dance practice , memorization drills and exercise , " the same thing I did at her age , " said Britney . " I won nationwide trophies for my Ronald Reagan tap numbers , so one day Ashley and I are looking at my pageant tapes and she points up and says ' I want to win some statues too , Mommy , ' so I signed her up for dance class . It wasn ' t but two hours on a Saturday and they didn ' t give them any routines to learn , so I taught her some myself . "
