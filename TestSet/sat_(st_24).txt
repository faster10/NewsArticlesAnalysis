" I met Francesco ' s father on the internet while trying to find a father to my child . This 26 year old man is a Catholic and that is all that is important to me . I wanted my child to be born in a union sanctified by the Catholic church . I know we are not married and that he will not play a part in Francesco ' s life , but I have written to the pope to ask his absolution . I have also named my child after the pope in his honor and so I believe he should find a place in his heart to forgive me in this particular situation . I still love my deceased husband and desire to stay a widow until I leave this earth , but I needed the seed of this young fervent Catholic to fulfill God ' s will , " she explained .
