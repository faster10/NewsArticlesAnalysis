You have to recognize , Hillary Clinton was the United States Senator for New York , just like I ' m a United States Senator from California and San Francisco Bay Area , where I have Silicon Valley , and Hollywood , where I have the movie industry , and I fight for them . So you have to recognize that Wall Street was part of who Hillary represented . That ' s why I think it ' s fantastic that she ' s taken them on , as she has . I know that a Sanders ad basically implied that she had taken speaking fees . Speaking fees are one thing . Your policies are what ' s really important .
