In a landmark multi fast food chain study conducted earlier this year , 10 , 000 Americans were assessed at 3 minute intervals using the GFCS from entry into a fast food restaurant or buffet until naptime . Prior to ordering a Whopper or a Big Mac , patients scored a GFCS of 15 ( E4 V5 M6 ) . As the meal progressed , particularly with consumption of French fries and hash browns , GFCS scores markedly decreased : the majority of patients met criteria for severe food coma within 30 minutes of food intake .
