Fort Lauderdale District Attorney Gavin Demarest says the Mayor isn ' t above the law . " It ' s unfortunate Mayor Seiler needed to be charged , but we take the law seriously here in Fort Lauderdale . We don ' t make exceptions and we try our best to do everything by the book . Mayor Seiler ' s case is extreme , and I ' m sure the judge will take that into consideration , but at the end of the day , the law is the law , and Mayor Seiler broke it . "
