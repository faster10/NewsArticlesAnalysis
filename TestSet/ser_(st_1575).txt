SS : But , General , okay , the problem is that some may think they re smarter than all of us together , because for some reason we can t get anti ISIS front up and running . Lately , this incident with Russian plane being shot down , really hampered the efforts , because Russia and France obviously want a grand coalition of coalitions , but America is saying no , just join the coalition that we re leading is anyone going to budge ? I mean , are we going to just come together and fight it ?
