Just before setting off for the hill , Beck gets a call from Steve Fine , SI ' s director of photography . Fine has a request for Beck to get White at a certain angle . Beck ' s sure he can ' t and tells Fine that he has a great shot in mind , looking up the pipe as White soars into action . Fine likes that but wants to have one with the crowd in the background . Beck and Kinno agree it ' s not a clean shot from where Beck will be , but they can try and see what Fine says .
