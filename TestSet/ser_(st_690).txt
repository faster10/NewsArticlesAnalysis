The public option , expanding Medicare coverage to people beginning at the age of 55 , importation of drugs from Canada and bulk price negotiations were all traded away by the Obama administration , and in their place Democrats offered 450 billion in taxpayer money to publicly subsidize the mandated purchase of private health insurance , effectively expanding and entrenching the corporate monopoly over the collective health of millions of people while still managing to leave 27 million people uninsured by 2025 . And all of this was done with industry lobbyists behind closed doors , in total disregard for Obama s campaign pledge to negotiate with the companies on C SPAN and put an end to the same old game playing in Washington .
