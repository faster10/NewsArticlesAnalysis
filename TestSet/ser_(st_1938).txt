( On if the three offensive linemen they drafted last year will compete for starting spots next season : ) Yeah , and at that position in particular , yeah . Kristjan Sokoli , I m really excited about what he can do . But he s a transition guy , and we decided not to try and force the issue with him to try to make him play right now . He needs a whole other year to get through this , and then we ll see where he is . He s an exceptional athlete . I want to see him play center , I want to see how he does there as he grows through it , and just see how much ground he can make up , and see where that leaves us . We ll have one of the really good athletes at center if that s where he winds up playing . He s fast , he s quick , he s athletic , and all of that . But the transition , it s more than just sticking him out there . We did that with Sweez J . R . Sweezy and that was hard , that was hard on him . So we ll see , hopefully we ve learned how to do this , and we ll make good progress with that .
