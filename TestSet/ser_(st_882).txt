There is more than one area of concern for the Packers right now . The defense , for example , has allowed 22 . 8 points per game over the last five weeks after allowing 16 . 3 per game over the first six . That ' s a problem . But Green Bay used to be able to win games pretty consistently when the defense allowed nearly that many points per game . The Packers went 12 4 with a defense that allowed 21 . 8 points per game just last year . They ' ve not shown the same ability to overcome that level of defense over the last five weeks .
