" Our YouTube Channel , Drug Seeking Made Easy , has gone totally viral ! " explained Dr Sofia LaRocca , the program ' s head of outreach . " Most drug seekers of course know which allergies to list , such as Toradol , but they often made classic errors that would get them a CT or other test . Our program has been able to teach people to avoid that sort of unnecessary unnecessary testing and get right to the details that tend to compel providers to write the desired prescriptions . "
