" We ' re beginning to run out of supplies needed to keep up with the pace with my daughter ' s ' Help the victims of Katrina ' bake sales , which seems to happen every other day , " said mother of two Janine Miller , as she searched the frozen food section of the grocery store for a suitable evening meal for her family and rubbed her hands , bandaged and bleeding from the strain of constant baking , with a grimace . " We ' ve had to resort to plain Rice Krispy treats after being depleted of M M ' s , Skittles and even sprinkles . My son is always begging me for rides to these functions that his Boy scout leaders are putting on where they wash cars for donations , or something . We ' re happy to do our part , but I pray that the relief effort comes to a close down there in time for the Fall television season , or I don ' t know what we ' ll do . "
