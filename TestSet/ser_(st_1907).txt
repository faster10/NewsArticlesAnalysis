Mr Trump , you have criticized my religion , Carly s appearance , demeaned Jeb s family , and called many here tonight losers or worse . You are a braggart , a bully and a bigot . You couldn t last 10 minutes in my neighborhood growing up . You worship money and find no sight greater than what you see looking in the mirror . You disrespect Hispanics , women , and those who pray to God differently than you do . Your impulse is always to divide , not unite , to label , not love , to hit , not heal . With all due respect , your ego and vanity are appalling , no wonder you are more unpopular than Hillary Clinton .
