" We demand to know why the police were targeting these people , and the flimsy guise of ' preventing terrorism ' is no excuse , " announced Henry Wagner of the American Civil Liberties Union of Philadelphia . " There was not one person of European or American decent amongst those arrested in the supposed terrorist plot , which is only further proof that law enforcement officials are targeting and bullying the Muslim community . And the fact that authorities are not immediately releasing all details of the bust only further proves that this is an act of unconscionable racism . "
