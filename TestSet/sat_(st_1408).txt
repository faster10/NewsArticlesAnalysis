" It ' s embarrassing , " says Dr Cranquis . " There I am , with some patient yakking away about post nasal drip or something , and I ' ll subtly glance down at my breast pocket to pick a drug name at random , as I always did . But nowadays , my pocket usually has black unlabeled pens in it I mainly keep my precious Nasonex and Neurontin pens stored in the locked narc cabinet . That ' s when the horror hits me all over again : Why oh why didn ' t I pay attention in pharmacology class ? "
