' I am not a perfect son . I am not a perfect husband . I am not a perfect parent , but I am , without a doubt , not a child abuser . I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury . No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him . My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that ' s what I tried to do that day .
