" So the pictures I took of Atlantis , rest assured I took them , will come out as soon as the photo lab finishes with them , " Fiorina told her crowd , " and I didn ' t want to do one hour photo because I didn ' t want them rushed I wanted them perfect . But now that you mention it , it has been a few years since I dropped it off , so maybe they lost the film ? Yeah , that ' s the ticket . They lost the film . But boy did I see the Lost City of Atlantis that day . "
