If Russia is committed to the survival of its ally in Syria , that is a factor that cannot be ignored . Over the past few days , the notion of putting American forces on the ground in Syria seemed to be gaining support domestically . But to do so absent an alliance with Russia that goes beyond current " deconfliction " efforts to avoid unintended incidents between our aircraft and theirs in our respective air wars over Syrian territory would be enormously risky , as the downing of the Russian jet suggests . If we have troops on the ground while Russia is independently engaged in an air war over the country , it is inevitable that at some point American soldiers would be killed by Russian bombs , leading to terrible potential escalation possibilities .
