When a kid watches a female flower metaphor sex up and then rip apart the male flower , feelings of sexual inadequacy will fill his young mind . When a child sees the bright rotating strobe lights while a chorus of tribal singers feign orgasm over a B3 driven groove , the urge to commit sodomy is implanted in his mind . I could go on , but imagine the terror your young one will experience watching the expressions contained in songs titled " Young Lust , " " Comfortably Numb , " and " Pigs ( Three Different Ones ) . "
