Although the perfectionist Warriors will view the fourth quarter as a sign that they need to improve , Tuesday ' s contest was another demonstration of their historically great form . The Pacers came into the game tied for the second best record in the East and opted to play the same fast paced style that has seen them to top 10 rankings in both offensive and defensive efficiency . The results were disastrous ? the Warriors went on a 22 0 run during the opening quarter on their way to 44 points in the period , tying a 25 year old record for most points allowed by the Pacers in the first . A 35 point second continued the onslaught and saw Golden State fall just one point short of tying the Pacers ' 37 year old mark for most points allowed in the first half . It bears repeating that Indiana played its ideal pace and still looked overwhelmed by Golden State . Even the teams that seem most equipped to run with the Warriors end up gasping for air .
