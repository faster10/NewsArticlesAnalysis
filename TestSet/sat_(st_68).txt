Sir William Wallace ( from the Gaelic Uilliam Uallas ) was a Scottish member of the lesser nobility who became one of the main leaders of the rebels during the Wars of Scottish Independence . Along with Andrew Moray , Wallace defeated an English army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in September 1297 , and was appointed Guardian of Scotland by an assembly of noblemen . He commanded the Scottish army until his defeat at the Battle of Falkirk in July 1298 , when he resigned from his function . He was captured in August 1305 in Robroyston , near Glasgow , after the betrayal of the Scottish knight John de Menteith , and was handed over to King Edward I of England , who had him tortured and killed for high treason and crimes against English civilians . He is depicted in the very inaccurate but award winning historical drama Braveheart , directed by and starring Mel Gibson , that was released in 1995 .
