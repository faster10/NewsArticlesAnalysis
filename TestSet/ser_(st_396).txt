Who is a progressive ? ( Sanders yesterday charged that anyone who takes money from Wall Street and has a Super PAC doesn t meet the standard , while Clinton replied that Sanders purity test would disqualify many in her party . ) Who is the real Democrat in this race ? ( Clinton has listed her long time working for the party , while Sanders has never associated with it until now . ) What is the best way to create political change ? ( Is it through Clinton s experience and perseverance ? Or Sanders revolution ? ) And what is the top job for the next Democratic president ? ( Is it protecting the gains made over the last seven years and improving them at the margins ? Or is it by going in a completely different direction ? )
