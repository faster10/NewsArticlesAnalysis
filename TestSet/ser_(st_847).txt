Montenegro has a small army of just some 2 , 000 soldiers , but it is strategically located on the Adriatic sea , between NATO members Croatia and Albania , having deep water navy bases that could be used for big navy ships and submarines . Bringing in Montenegro to the NATO sphere further diminishes Russia ' s influence in southeast Europe , and blocks it from the so called " warm seas " in Europe . The Russians are not so much worried about the strategic military loss , but more about their diminishing political influence on the region .
