I know this struggle . I went through it myself . Thirteen years ago , I opposed same sex marriage and supported the watered down alternative civil unions . As a practical matter , I thought activists should focus on things such as a federal civil rights bill outlawing private sector discrimination due to sexual orientation . Then a gay family member helped me see the light . I now understand that we can ' t have a two tiered system , where some of us enjoy the right to marry and our brothers and sisters and cousins don ' t , based solely on sexual orientation .
