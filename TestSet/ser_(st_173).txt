Commercial oil inventories , already at record levels in the industrialized world , look set to keep building through at least the first half of next year without some sort of dramatic move in supply or demand . That could push prices into the 30s or even the 20s . Granted , that doesn t look as dramatic as the move from 100 to 40 seen in the past year or so . But 25 oil would still represent a drop of about 40 percent from here , and E P balance sheets are a lot more stretched now than they were in late 2014 .
