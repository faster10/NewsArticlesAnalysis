Each was able to come out of this section well enough , though with a few dings . Sanders explained his foreign policy views in broad strokes , giving Clinton openings to show off her more granular knowledge of the issues . When Sanders mentioned that Muslim nations in the region ? Saudi Arabia , Iran , Turkey , Jordan are going to have to get their hands dirty , their boots on the ground in the fight against ISIS in Syria , Clinton was ready with a retort : I think that is very unfair to a few you mentioned , most particularly Jordan , which has put a lot on the line for the United States , has also taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria and has been therefore subjected to threats and attacks by extremists themselves . Clinton s knowledge of the issues , meanwhile , allowed her to filibuster through more difficult questions pertaining to her role in the toppling of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya and the mess it left . Clinton also managed the right tone in preserving her general election message . She distanced herself from President Obama s heavily criticized comments about how ISIS is contained , arguing that it cannot be contained , it must be ? defeated . ( How is still anyone s guess , in either party . )
