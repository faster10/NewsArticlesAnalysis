MF : Yeah , I think there s a lot of people profiting from ISIS . I think , number one , we have to collectively , together , we have to clearly define the enemy that we re facing . We have to clearly define our enemy . This is a cancerous form inside of the Islamic religion and people tend to use the phrase radical Islamists , and I think that that s a good definition . I ve heard one word in Arabic , fa hish which means beyond despicable and I think that it s even a better word that we see , this other word that s used Daesh this is an enemy that emanated from this region , Middle East , and it is now geographically dispersed , geographically dispersed here in Russia , it s geographically dispersed in Europe , certainly in the U . S . we have seen all these various attacks just recently , Russia had its own issues in 2002 , in Moscow at the theater , in 2004 in North Ossetia , where the same ideology killed children . I mean , this attack in California recently , it was against social services organisation , I mean , it s just unbelievable .
