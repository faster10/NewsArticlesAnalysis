Rather than banning words that might potentially hurt someone ' s feelings , why don ' t we ostracize those who embrace tyranny and the need to control others behavior ? Censorship is for cowards who can ' t deal with criticism or cope with living in a free society . Yet , I suppose it ' s easier to screech about empowerment and equality while expecting the world to hand it over to you on a silver platter . Working towards actual goals might prove to be a bit too daunting . It ' s just easier to play the victim .
