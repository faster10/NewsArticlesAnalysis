" MySpace is great , because it gives you a chance to get your name out there to people who would never otherwise hear about you , " said drummer Devin Franks . " Back in the day you ' d have to play bars , clubs , carnivals , and all kinds of places just to make yourselves known , but now we have a chance to present ourselves to our fans before having any gigs , or before even having any music written . This is a huge boost to the music community . "
