" It ' s not about homosexuality or lesbianism or anything like that . " says songwriter Lori Mckenna . " It ' s not even about wanting a girl because she has the guy I want , but considering the lyrical content , that would probably make a whole lot more sense . No . . . I was just sitting at Applebees and they didn ' t have Coke , and I didn ' t want Pepsi , so I pointed to a girl in the booth next to mine and said that I ' ll just have what she ' s having . "
