According to Genesis 8 : 4 , the Ark came to rest " on the mountains of Ararat " , but many different theories have emerged over the years as to what mountains exactly was supposed to correspond to this description . While later Christian tradition had placed the Ark near the summit of Mount Ararat , the Syrian tradition of the early centuries AD had a tradition of the Ark landing at Mount Judi , where according to Josephus the remains of the ark were still shown in the 1st century AD . The location of the " Place of Descent " described by Josephus was some 100 km to the southeast of the peak now known as Mount Ararat , placing it in Northern Irak , almost exactly at the site of today ' s discovery .
