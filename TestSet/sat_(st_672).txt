" You see we all have a choice , " stated CEO Smith in an address to the nation . " We can choose to get Starbucks at the kiosk in the mall , or at the corner store on your way home . Ever since our inception , Starbucks has wanted to give Americans more variety , and our efforts to give the civilized world the choice between skim or whole milk lattes will not be stymied by the likes of this former rabble rouser Dumacher . The public can come along with us quietly or spend years pontificating to friends and relatives about our company not using Fair Trade coffee and all the bullshit that anyone can read off of websites that makes us sound like big meanies before giving in like a mongrel dog with its tail between its legs , and a double caramel latte latte in its hands .
