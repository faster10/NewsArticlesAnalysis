Sloane says the noise will be deafening as metal twists and windows pop . The ship has been rigged with cameras and microphones to help the salvage crew monitor the ship ' s structure as it is lifted . As Sloane says , ships this size were never meant to lie on their sides , and they are not built to be lifted . The salvage team says they will be able to contain any spillage of toxins with oil booms now in place around the work site . The broken glass and new debris will join what is already at the bottom of the sea .
