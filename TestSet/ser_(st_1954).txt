I first spoke to Shazia last November , a month after the attempted assassination . She told me then of her determination to persevere and to speak up for a girl ' s right to education . She called education the light that brightens up girls ' lives . And when I met her off the plane from Islamabad on Saturday night , she told me that she wanted every girl to have the chance of an education . Her dream , she said , was to build schools so that every out of school girl could develop their talents and fulfil their potential .
