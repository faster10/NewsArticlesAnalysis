Wilcox says that most providers don ' t realize that their unhappiness is due to not seeing enough patients . It may seem like they are unhappy due to the work load when in reality having a census of 75 patients is when you have a true epiphany and realize , " You know what ? I ' m truly happy with my job . Gee , those administrators really get it . " Wilcox added : " If I can manage a thousand hospital administrators , surely you guys can manage a few patients here and there . "
