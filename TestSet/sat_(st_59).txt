The large monument , apparently sealed off and hidden in the 3rd or 4th century AD , possibly to protect it from the christian repression and destruction of pagan sites after the change of official religion within the Roman Empire . The entire site is a testimony to the multicultural nature of Alexander ' s empire , combining artistic and architectural influences from both Greek , Egyptian , Macedonian and Persian origins . The inscriptions , mostly in greek , but including also a few egyptian hieroglyphs , mention that the Mausoleum is dedicated to the " King of Kings , and Conqueror of the World , Alexander III " .
