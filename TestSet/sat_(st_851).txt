The best part about ICD 10 is that there are thousands upon thousands more codes . Isn ' t it wonderful ? Were you bitten by a shark ? We have three codes for that ! Or were you struck by a shark ? Because we have three codes for that too ! It ' s a golden time to be a medical coder , I absolutely LOVE IT ! And since I love it , our providers must love it too ! I particularly love the codes on macaws and roller skates . This is what medicine is all about !
