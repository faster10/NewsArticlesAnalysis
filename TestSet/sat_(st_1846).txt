One anonymous insider says the new party is close to being announced . " Glenn Beck will make history with this party . He ' s devoting a lot of his time to it . He isn ' t on TV anymore , and doesn ' t make the waves he used to . It ' s not like he has any better way to spend his time . So he ' s going to devote every waking moment to this project , and I think he ' s going to pull it off . I think he ' s going to manage to save America before Obama destroys it and institutes Sharia law . We ' re really close . "
