Dr Oz ' s peddling of mind boggling health products , dispensing medical advice of a maniacal and delusional lunatic as well as poorly written TV jokes are a clear violation of professional ethics and human decency all together . This board was charged with a monumental task of disciplining such an egregious deviation from common sense and evisceration of moral principles of medical profession . After an extensive review of our options and solicited input from the AMA , Health Insurers Association of America , U . S . Congress , Doc McStuffins , President Dr Ben Carson and Nurse Practitioner General , we have concluded that only a single course of action adjudicates his transgressions and reciprocates the consequences of his quackery . Dr Oz is hereby ordered to return back to his full time surgical practice starting Monday . To reiterate : He is to provide direct patient care in accordance with standards endorsed by his specialty board , while abiding with the policies and procedures of the facility where he is credentialed to practice . No more , no less . While some may find this measure too harsh or unfair , we feel that the punishment fits the crime . "
