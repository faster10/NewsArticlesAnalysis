Beck ' s assignment is not solely White it ' s just that the 23 year old budding legend is such a prohibitive favorite it makes sense to Beck that ' s his main target . He ' s shooting for the magazine , but he also hopes the Web site can use his photos . In fact , the Web is much more of a sure thing this time . Sports Illustrated ' s deadlines aren ' t until the weekend , and the magazine won ' t arrive at subscribers ' homes until a week after the event , so Beck figures it ' s unlikely this gig has cover potential . And with Lindsey Vonn such a compelling story , too , he ' s not sure that he ' ll even get one image in the magazine .
