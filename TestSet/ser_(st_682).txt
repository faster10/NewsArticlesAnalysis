You don ' t have to be an aficionado of fine art to walk into a public gallery , stand before a painting done by someone long dead , and think : One day , many generations ago , whoever created this work decided that this tiny brushstroke here would be preferable to another , subtly different one that this shade of red in this corner was the ideal one , instead of a shade more vivid or more muted that the shadows over on this side of the canvas were what was needed to set the proper mood . And now , all these years later , a stranger standing in front of the painting in a town the artist never visited is thinking about the mind behind those choices .
