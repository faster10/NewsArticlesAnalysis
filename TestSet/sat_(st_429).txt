" There has been talk of a draft lately , " he admitted , " but I ' m here to tell you today that we shan ' t be needing one , because our troops will be leaving Iraq , effective immediately . Our duty there , convoluted as it might have been , is now done . We have trained over 300 , 000 Iraqi troops , who , as you know , were filled with goodwill and duty because of how nice we were to them , and how we didn ' t do things like abuse prisoners . They are now ready and willing to take over their democracy . It ' s time to end this chapter of American history . "
