In a moment of unrestrained criticism , God said that he " briefly considered firing that huckster from humanity , not just Christianity " but that he " would have felt too sorry for any other species I transformed that miserable , selfish , money worshiping Pharisee into " and ultimately decided on just removing the conservative , evangelical Christian from his company . " Would I want to insult pond scum by turning him into it ? Would I want to say to the bottom feeding carp in Earth ' s lakes , ' Hey , I ' m going to make this piece of shit human into one of you guys , ' of course I wouldn ' t , " God said , " so unfortunately for the rest of humanity , you ' re going to have to deal with Huckabee being among you until he dies . But the good news is that as much gravy and grits as he eats , it won ' t be too , too much longer until that happens , and I ' ve already confirmed with Lucifer that Huck ' s accommodations are ready . "
