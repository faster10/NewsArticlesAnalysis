" I love doing open heart surgery , " said Dr Edward Lethem , Director of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Johns Hopkins . " But I have to support my family and , lately , I haven ' t been able to do that by saving people ' s lives . " This week , Dr Lethem began a job working at a local T . G . I . Friday ' s where he regularly makes 100 200 a night more than doing cardiac surgery . " The money is better here , but the real appeal is getting to express myself with my little pieces of flair , " Dr Lethem said , showing off his brand new T . G . I . Friday ' s vest covered in buttons .
