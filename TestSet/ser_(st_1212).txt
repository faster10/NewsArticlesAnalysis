' He is a different style of player for us . We have Andres Iniesta and Xavi and they are sweet players and you can enjoy watching them on the ball , it ' s easy on the eye . Not with Suarez . He fights and scraps for the ball and finally gets the goal . In training you see that ultra competitive streak . You can kick him and he just never goes down . You pull his shirt and he still goes towards the goal . It ' s true that he had a reputation in England ( for diving ) but you fall once in the Premier League and it sticks . I have found him to be a very fair player . '
