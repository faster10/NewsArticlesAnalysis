" So I dug deep . I knew Drago was blood doping , but I went all natural . While he was working out in his state of the art facility in Moscow , I was in the Russian back country , being constantly monitored . " Fiorina told her supporters that she would do pull ups in the rustic cabin she was living in , hanging from the banister . She told the audience and reporters that she ' d climb giant , snow covered mountains , leaving her Russian chaperons in the dust , and she ' d scream out Drago ' s name when she got to the top .
