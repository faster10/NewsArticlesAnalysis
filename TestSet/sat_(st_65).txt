London A team of construction workers employed at demolishing an old pub last month in the Bermondsey district of the London borough of Southwark , have discovered an ancient and badly damaged wooden crate containing three pierced human skulls , presumably the severed heads of criminals or traitors that had been impaled on pikes and displayed at the southern gatehouse of the Old London Bridge . The remains , which were sent to the Ireland to be analyzed by a team of archaeologists associated with the National Museum of Ireland , have turned out to be those of 14th Century rebel heroes of the Wars of Scottish Independence , including that of the former Guardian of Scotland , William Wallace .
