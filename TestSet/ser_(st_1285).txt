Remember , these are all criticisms and doomsaying from Republicans , about the man who ( if the polling holds steady , as it has so far ) has the best chance of becoming their party ' s nominee . It ' s all pretty extraordinary language for Republicans to be using against one of their own . I guess Ronald Reagan ' s famed " 11th Commandment " ( " Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican " ) doesn ' t apply when it comes to Trump , eh ?
