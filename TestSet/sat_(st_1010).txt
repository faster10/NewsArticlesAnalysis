The attachment , which hooks on to a standard Google Glass device , is a cartridge which can be pre loaded with any of a number of possible allergens however , the lion ' s share of requests have been for the combined NSAID and acetaminophen cartridge . When activated by pressing a button , the cartridge then shoots a virtually imperceptible 1 mm wide dart at the patient containing a small reservoir of this allergen . If the patient is truly allergic , the recipient ' s skin will begin to react and a special dye contained within the projectile will turn the surrounding skin a deep red color which can be perceived only though wearing the Google Glasses . If the patient is not allergic , the dart is designed to turn blue .
