Moscow A friend of mine who grew up in a small Soviet town realized he was gay by age 15 . He did not know the word but he could no longer deny that he was sexually attracted to boys , not girls . He had no idea what it meant and felt rather lost . So , he went to see a kind , elderly doctor and hesitantly asked the question . After a stretch of uncomfortable silence , the doctor said quietly , " Take a lot of vitamin C and hopefully it ' ll get better with time . . . . But most importantly , don ' t ever mention this to anyone . "
