' I have learned a lot and have had to reevaluate how I discipline my son going forward . But deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives . I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man . I love my son and I will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes I ever make .
