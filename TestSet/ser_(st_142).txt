Sanders down to earth routine is showing its seams , however . He claims he doesn t attack opponents , but he immediately pivoted into arguing that Clinton is basically a Wall Street stooge and even going so far as to imply that Clinton doesn t take climate change seriously . He dismisses the importance of polls , but uses them to bolster his argument that he s electable . Sanders personal charm and political skills have distracted from these aspects of his campaign for a long time , but as the election drags on , these shell games ? which all politicians play , of course , but which he holds himself above ? are becoming a little more obvious .
