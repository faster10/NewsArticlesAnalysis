As we wrapped up our interview with Mr Phillips , his elderly mother appeared in the doorway with a tray of tea and crumpets for us to partake of before our departure . I asked the elder Mrs Phillips what her take was in regards to her son ' s theories , and she was quick to provide us with an answer . " I think it ' s a load of pure hogwash . I think if my son would spend less time on the computer spouting crazy talk and more time looking for a job , we wouldn ' t be in this mess . He needs to get out of my house , I tell you ! GET OUT OF MY HOUSE ! " She violently flung the tea tray towards her son , dousing one of our photographers in the process . Mr Phillips quickly ushered us outside without a word , as if these sorts of outbursts were commonplace in their home .
