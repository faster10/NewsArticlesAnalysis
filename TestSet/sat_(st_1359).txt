Intensivist Michael Johannson agreed to an interview . " It just goes to show what early and aggressive intervention can do in these cases . A man presented to the hospital at death ' s doorstep , and thanks to the institution of a protocol focusing on measurable parameters , the patient is alive and was discharged in the same state of health he was in prior to falling ill . Our goal directed care is the biggest reason that Mr Billings can continue to enjoy his time lying on a stretcher at thrice weekly dialysis sessions , staring off into space while caregivers clean and attend to him , and the joy of having his decubitus ulcers debrided and redressed every other day .
