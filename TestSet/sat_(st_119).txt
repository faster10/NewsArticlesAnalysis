" The country ' s best investigators are already on the case , trying to determine what happened to the train , " M . Hussein told reporters . " For the moment , we are not discarding any leads or hypothesis . We have no evidence indicating that an accident occurred , so we are still hoping to find the train intact , with the crew and passengers unhurt . We ' ve mobilized a lot of ressources to find it , including planes , helicopters , ships and numerous soldiers , so it ' s only a question of time before we succeed . "
