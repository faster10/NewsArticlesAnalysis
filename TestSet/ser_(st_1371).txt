Wilson ' s criticism of the film starts off as a numbers game . She points out that only one of the new toys is female , leaving the film with a 3 to 1 boy girl ratio . This math can ' t be denied .

And even though there is an increasing number of unisex toys in the world , it ' s still unusual to see a little boy playing with traditionally female toys .
