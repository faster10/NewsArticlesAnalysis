Susan Meyers , Deputy Assistant Director of Social Media for Clinton ' s Granite State effort tells reporters that her boss ' s policy goals are a " tremendously accurate replication of Senator Sanders " and that because of this fact " Sanders supporters should just accept fate and let Ms . Clinton do a fairly good job of giving lip service to maybe considering performing as president the way Bernie would . " Meyers said that Clinton is " supremely confident in her abilities to sound like she will be a champion of the middle class and won ' t instead capitulate to the Wall Street financiers who are bankrolling her campaign " so " Bernie fans should just stop supporting the authentic candidate with a proven track record of advocacy in favor of the politician who will at the very least still be better than Donald Trump .
