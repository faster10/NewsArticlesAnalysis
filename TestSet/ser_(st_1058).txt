In the weeks after the accident , the divers called the inside of the ship a " toxic stew " of spilled oil , rotting food and floating tableware . There were five massive restaurants on the ship each one in operation when the ship crashed at 9 : 42 p . m . on January 13 , 2013 , spilling tables of buffet food into the water . More than a dozen kitchens and freezers had enough food to feed the 4 , 200 passengers and crew for a week , plus extra supplies that all cruise ships carry in case of emergencies and delays . Many of the freezers burst and their contents were gobbled up by sea life and the colony of sea gulls that has multiplied on the island since the disaster .
