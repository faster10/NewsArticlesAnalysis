Rubionomics certainly has its flaws . For instance : His tax plan ? for all its good points ? loses trillions and cuts taxes too deeply for the rich , features sure to be politically treacherous if he ' s the party ' s nominee . Hopefully the next iteration of his plan will fix those flaws . And I would also like to see an explicit anti cronyist agenda in areas such as banking , patents , and copyright . But at least he ' s not trying to bring back 1960s heavy industry America , regurgitate 1980s Reaganomics , or substitute partisan talking points for serious policy .
