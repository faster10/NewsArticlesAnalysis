Liberals love to throw their support behind what I ' ve said in the past is " the browning of America . " They love minorities , because minorities cash those big government checks that keep left wing socialist programs alive . But can you imagine living in a brown America ? Can you imagine living in a country where Obama , or people like him , are always president ? Where Shaniqua , the girl with the big colorful fingernails who screwed up your order at the McDonald ' s drive thru , is also delivering your mail , teaching your child ' s eighth grade history class , or doing your taxes ? Would you want to live in an America where our pledge of allegiance is changed to " One nation , under God , he ' s my n ga , with liberty and justice for all ? " I don ' t want to live in that America . You don ' t want to live in that America , either . We need to learn to appreciate everything whites have given to this country . We need to learn to take pride in being white , and not feel ashamed of our heritage .
