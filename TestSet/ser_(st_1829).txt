Why should vanity become a dirty word , when we women are praised from childhood for prettiness , and complimented on how we look ? When I was little , whenever we went away on holiday , my ever glamorous mother would clutch her vanity case to her bosom as though it housed the crown jewels . To me , it had an aura of magic : turning the tiny golden key and flipping the mirrored leather lid , I would marvel at the array of lotions and potions that make up a woman ' s beauty armoury , corralled in their hand stitched compartments . No wonder the word vanity came to have positive connotations for me .
