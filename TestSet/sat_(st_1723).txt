" This was an embarrassing gaffe , but rest assured , the First Family was in no danger that evening , " insists Secret Service Public Relations Director Ron Butterfield . " Mr Stapp had never stepped foot inside the White House . He just came onto the lawn , found a bush , and slept under it , without making a peep . We have no reason to believe he was armed or that he posed any serious threat . If he returns , he ' ll be arrested on the spot . "
