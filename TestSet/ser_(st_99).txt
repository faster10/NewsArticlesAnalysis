There ' s plenty to do , as runners have shown in the week since the bombing . Within hours of the blasts , people all over the world were lacing up their running shoes and going outside to run . It ' s a simple , selfish act . Some did it to clear their heads . Others to process what had just happened to fellow runners and those cheering them on . I did it because I felt like I just needed to do something . And I feel all the more compelled to keep training because of inspirational stories like those of Adrianne Haslet Davis , a dance instructor who lost her foot in the bombing but vows to dance and run again .
