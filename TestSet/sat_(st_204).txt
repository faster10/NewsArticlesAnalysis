Muslim historian and geographer Abul Hassan Ali Ibn Al Hussain Al Masudi ( 871 957 CE ) wrote in his book Muruj adh dhahab wa maadin aljawhar ( The meadows of gold and quarries of jewels ) that during the rule of the Muslim caliph of Spain Abdullah Ibn Mohammad ( 888 912 CE ) , a Muslim navigator , Khashkhash Ibn Saeed Ibn Aswad , from Cortoba , Spain sailed from Delba ( Palos ) in 889 CE , crossed the Atlantic , reached an unknown territory ( ard majhoola ) and returned with fabulous treasures . In Al Masudi ' s map of the world there is a large area in the ocean of darkness and fog which he referred to as the unknown territory , which many scholars believe to be the Americas .
