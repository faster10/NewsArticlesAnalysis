But not all of Rubio ' s rivals are dealing as realistically with America ' s economic challenges , particularly those who would supposedly disrupt the GOP . Trump sells a moldy and fact free economic nostalgia where tariffs will bring back jobs from Asia and mass deportations will lead to faster rising incomes . But at least there he ' s offering some sort of plan , as opposed to health care and education . Zip on those fronts . ( Note : I do not consider a promise to " knock the hell " out of college costs to be a higher ed plan . )
