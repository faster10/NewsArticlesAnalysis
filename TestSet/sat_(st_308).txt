Brown and Mr Goldman , because given the meticulous detail in which he describes how he would have cut them mercilessly with sharp objects and then padded his alibi with a trip to LAX makes me think that he would have gotten away with it , " said FOX News anchor Juliet Huddy .

The way he talked in detail about slitting Nicole Brown ' s neck to the point that she would be nearly decapitated makes me glad that it wasn ' t him that did it , or it would have been a horrific , grisly scene .
