Rep . Trey Gowdy ( R SC ) , took a libertarian point of view . " Obviously since every human being eventually dies anyway , when you look at the number of kids dying in schools it ' s such a rare occasion that we really shouldn ' t do anything about it at all . " When asked by reporters what he ' d tell future victims of school shootings he shrugged and said , " Well , I guess I ' d tell them that nothing can bring their loved ones back , and that even if it could , I ' d ask them if my freedom to own as many firearms of as high a caliber and killing potential as possible ? Because as an elected official , I can tell you that we have at least three meetings weekly to propose becoming a tyrannical , monolithic regime instead of the fractured and polarized group we actually are . "
