Tony said what happened next was straight out of a horror film . " As the plane began to descend and the pressure dropped in the plane We heard an awful noise . The entire contents of someones body just splashing out . People nearest to the woman began to scream so we knew it was bad . The floor There was blood , and body fluid just rolling across the floor . We all picked up our feet and tried to hug our knees so we would not get any on ourselves . I guess the woman ' s body was so weakened by the virus that she just burst . Her weakened body could not withstand the pressure fluctuation when the plane began to go down Her organs turned to mush and came out of her . "
