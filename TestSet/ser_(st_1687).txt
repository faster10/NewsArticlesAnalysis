If you think random distribution to the lucky at below market prices is morally superior to selling to the highest bidder , why not support that in every other area of life ? Because then all of life would be a free for all . Buying a tube of toothpaste would be like Walmart after they open the doors at midnight for the Black Friday sale . Having prices rise and fall in response to changing demand makes for an orderly society where things go to those who really want something .
