According to national statistics for 2010 , less than half ( 47 ) of violent crimes committed in this country are " cleared " ( that is , suspects are arrested , charged , and turned over for prosecution ) and only one out of five ( 18 ) criminals who commit nonviolent crimes ( such as burglary ) are caught and tried . For obvious reasons there are no such statistics available for terrorists , and the fact that there was no successful attack in the U . S . over the past 10 years tends to make us complacent .
