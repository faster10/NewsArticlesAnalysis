Michelle Obama looks exactly like what she is : a modern American , working woman . Her outfits appear comfortable instead of buttoned up , her impression is pretty rather than formal , her silhouette based on sportswear the form of design that is at the heart of American fashion not politics . Add warmth , confidence , and openness and what the world is seeing besides someone who knows how to pack for a week is a woman they would want to know , to embrace as a neighbor or a friend .
