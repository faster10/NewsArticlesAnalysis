There are also a few helpful details about Karachi that Khan will have to pay heed to . Pakistan is manfully fighting the curse of a vast underworld of extortionists in the megacity . Of course , we will soon clean up the mess , but it is useful to know that the political parties short of funds are heavily into bhatta ( extortion ) taking ( not yet in vogue in India ? ) , which they share with over 15 terrorist outfits , formerly known as proxy warriors . Kidnapping of two types is rampant ? one that takes the victim to the highlands of Waziristan , and the other that takes the victim round and round in Karachi till you cough up the money . Khan and his family will be looked after by Hafiz Saeed , no doubt , so only the second type of brief kidnapping may be faced by them now and then .
