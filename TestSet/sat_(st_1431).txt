" Now that I can ' t work anymore , " said D ' Angelo , " I ' m going to have to go on disability . And I should be paid for what fourthhand smoke has done to me and myself . I should be getting prescriptions , and also , the money for those prescriptions . If opiates are the only currently available treatment for my condition at the moment , so be it . I ' ll do anything to ease the pain of my lingering cough . "
