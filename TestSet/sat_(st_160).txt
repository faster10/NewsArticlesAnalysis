" Both my wife and I have red hair , and it never stopped us from being happy , " the boy ' s father told reporters . " God has created me the way I am , and I not ashamed of his creation . Some mean kids at school have started bullying Liam over the last few years , and we tried to help him solve the problem . But now , some lawyer has convinced my son that it was actually our fault if others were picking on him , and he ' s suing us for millions . It ' s completely ridiculous ! We ' ve done nothing wrong . And seriously , I ' m an electrician and my wife is a hairdresser where does he expect us to find two million dollars ? "
