" We noticed a few months ago that something was wrong with our dog biscuit production , " says Mr Schopp . " When we checked the quantity of ingredients that were used in the production and the number of biscuits that were produced , the numbers just didn ' t add up ! We began installing more security cameras at various strategic locations throughout the factory , and we were finally able to identify the problem . Mr Larson , who worked in the quality check sector , was eating almost half of the biscuits that went by him . "
