" What happened in Orlando was so terrible , that we didn ' t have a choice but to react strongly , " said Mr Mulcair , moments after the kiss . " Unfortunately , many people still have problems accepting the simple fact of seeing two men kissing each other , and that ' s why this kind of gesture becomes so important . When Mr Trudeau called me to suggest that we should kiss , I must admit that I hesitated a little . However , he quickly convinced me that it was a good idea ! It was for a good cause , and to be honest , it was quite a kiss ! "
