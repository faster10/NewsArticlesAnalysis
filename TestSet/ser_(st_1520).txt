" Nina Pham served very bravely during a most difficult time as we all struggled to deal with the first case of Ebola to arrive in a U . S . hospital ' s emergency room . Texas Health Resources has a strong culture of caring and compassion , and we view all our employees as part of our family . That ' s why we have continued to support Nina both during and after her illness , and it ' s why she is still a member of our team . As distressing as the lawsuit is to us , we remain optimistic that we can resolve this matter with Nina . "
