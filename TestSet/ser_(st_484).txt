Disney spent at least 225 million on this Gore Verbinski directed western , which stars Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer ( though many commercials seem to ignore Hammer ' s presence altogether ) , but with terrible reviews and a major lack of social media activity , The Lone Ranger looks likely to become an expensive misfire for the studio . Just to earn back its budget domestically , The Lone Ranger will have to earn 40 million more than the highest grossing western of all time , Dances with Wolves , which took in 184 million in 1990 . That seems very , very unlikely .
