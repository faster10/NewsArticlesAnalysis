Russell Wilson was amazing against the Vikings ( 274 yards , 3 TD passes ) , but even with those stats , he might ' ve only been the 12th best player on the field for Seattle and that ' s because the Seahawks defense put a performance that was historically dominant . The Seahawks limited Minnesota to just 125 yards , marking the first time since 2005 that the Seahawks held a team under 130 yards . It was also only the fifth time in team history that they ' ve held an opponent under 130 . For the Vikings , it was their third lowest offensive total in franchise history , which dates back to 1961 . As for Wilson , he threw 3 TDs for the third straight game , becoming on the third QB in the NFL to do that this season .
