' Lake effect snow is heaviest when the lake waters are warm , and the air above is very cold , ' MLive . com said . ' The bigger the difference in lake to air temperature , the more intense the snow can fall . Colder lake waters would mean lake effect snow could be not as intense . That is not to say we won ' t still have what some would call heavy snow . It means the 24 to 36 inch lake effect snows in one to two days would be harder to achieve . '
