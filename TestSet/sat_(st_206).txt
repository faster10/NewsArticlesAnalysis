" Healthy Americans suffer more and more every year , " said the Vice president of the Alliance , Joseph McCain . " Every time we go to the restaurant , we have to pay for a portion which is clearly oversized . We often have to do all the physical work , because we ' re the only ones fit enough to do it . Even worst than that , in some professional groups like truck drivers or police officers , non overweight people don ' t even count for 20 of the work force , and they find themselves marginalized and discriminated because of their weight . It ' s time for Congress to act , and stop this injustice . "
