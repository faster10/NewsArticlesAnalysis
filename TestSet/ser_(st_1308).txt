" Critics don ' t look at a film and notice that every one of the lead roles is white , " said Ronda Racha Penrice , author of " African American History For Dummies " and editor at " Uptown " magazine . " We ' re taught it ' s the norm , and it ' s not the norm . We believe that we can have really good films that have majority white casts why can ' t we believe that we can have a majority black , Latino , or Asian cast , and have a good film as well ? "
