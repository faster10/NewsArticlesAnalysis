" Every night , he came back from work with a really horrible breath " she said with disgust . " It was not just a normal bad breath , it was really a foul stench that never left , even if he brushed his teeth or used mouthwash . One day , I came back from work earlier than usual , and surprised him with his mouth full of dog biscuits ! I nearly threw up ! I was so disgusted , that I packed my things and left . I didn ' t know , however , that he was stealing the biscuits "
