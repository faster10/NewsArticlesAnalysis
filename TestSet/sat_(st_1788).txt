D or Highway Patrol were to pull someone over that is a registered firearm owner , that officer has the right to know this information going into the interaction , the same could be said about a local P . D or Highway Patrol Officer that pulled over a citizen that has tattoos that are not visible to the officer , the situations are honestly interchangeable in the eyes of National and Homeland Security .
