Like many addicts , he feels that if there is a rock bottom then they are still falling fast towards it . " I thought it couldn ' t get any worse than that horrible feeling after driving for six hours and breaking every speed limit by at least 9 miles per hour the whole way , but the day that I swerved across three lanes of traffic and cut off some little old lady in a Honda Skylark just to get to my exit a few seconds faster was a new low for me . And that ' s not the worst thing I done . "
