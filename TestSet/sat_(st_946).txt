When Gates was asked about why hydraulic lifts weren ' t being installed or available , Gates felt the lifts might reflect poorly on patient satisfaction scores . " Picture this , you are a patient here at our hospital . Can you imagine how embarrassing it must be to be placed in a lifting chair or device ? Talk about a self esteem killer , which we all know would lead to poor satisfaction scores . It would be equivalent to calling someone fat to their face . The price tag and the insult that goes with these devices is not worth it . "
