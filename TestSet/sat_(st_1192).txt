Dr Austin froze in panic that he may not make it out of the room in time for noon conference , and they were serving tacos too . Mr Jones continued to recall seemingly interesting events past that took the form of a non linear , vaguely goal directed monologue . Bargaining with any available higher power , Austin pleaded , God , I only ask that you have a nurse page me about anything right now . I promise I will never get annoyed by another page if you just page me right now . I even promise to renew TPA and restraint orders on time .
