Butterston says that almost immediately after the new laws took effect that made pot legal , he filed for his business license , and after going through the very rigorous controls Colorado has in place for approving such a license , Charlie opened up The Green Leaf in Broomfield . Within two weeks , Jane Butterston , Charlie ' s wife , said she knew that things were going to go well . " Charlie would go into the store at six in the morning and get back at eleven each night and tell me that from the moment he opened to the moment he closed , he had people streaming in to buy weed , " Mrs Butterston told us , adding that " people in this town really wanted their legal recreational weed , and they were sure glad we were there to sell it to them .
