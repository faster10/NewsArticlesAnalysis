The first people to notice the boat , were employees of the Ministry of Transport who had been called on the site to repair a road that had been carried away by a mudslide . They warned their superiors of the find and a team of archaeologists and other experts were rapidly dispatched to the location , to preserve the enormous structure and collect various samples . Due to the small part of the ship that was revealed at first , they were convinced that they were looking at a Roman or Phoenician merchant vessel , but remained puzzled by its inexplicable location . A more extensive excavation however revealed that the ship was much bigger than they first thought and the carbon dating analysis of the wood samples revealed its age as thousands of years older than expected , dating back somewhere between 8 500 and 7800 BC .
