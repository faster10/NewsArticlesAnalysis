However , as is traditional in presidential elections , France waited for the traditional countdown at 8 p . m . sharp to see the face of their next president and to start celebrating or commiserating . With 51 . 7 of the votes , the Socialist candidate Fran ois Hollande won a neat victory , albeit not a large one . His first few hours as president struck a different tone to Sarkozy ' s victory in 2007 . He addressed the nation from Corr ze , his regional bastion in the heart of France , and his speech was then followed by accordionists playing " La Vie en Rose . " He then hopped in a modest looking car to reach the nearest airport and fly to Paris to go straight to the Bastille where 100 , 000 people waited until after midnight to hear him speak again . No flashy restaurant on the Champs Elys es , no celebrities behind him , no cortege of expensive cars : Hollande appeared as Mr Normal from the first few minutes of his election .
