If it wasn ' t for the Grateful Dead , there is question whether the jamband craze would have taken off like it has . On one side of the fence , they say another band would have taken up the role of generation crushing turmoil gurus . Other points of view believe that without the Grateful Dead , the liberal peace , environment , ERA , and gay rights movement would never have gotten off the ground . Either way you look at this , life would not be so bad if there were never a Grateful Dead .
