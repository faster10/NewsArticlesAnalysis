" I used to be able to get the other girls to talk to me . I would just make that voice and people would come around and listen . They would say , ' Angie ' s so funny . ' But now that she ' s gone , they don ' t want to hear the voice . And they won ' t let me sit by them at lunch . Mrs Harper does the same things Mrs Boston did : we still have the boring social studies assignments , the patriarchal , xenophobic interpretations of American history , the stunted gender roles , and the socializing as a endless popularity contest . That said , Mrs Harper seems nice . "
