In second place , Disney ' s animated musical Frozen didn ' t melt despite the heat of dragon ' s breath . The film fell only 30 percent to 22 . 2 million in its third weekend , giving it a remarkable 164 . 4 million already more than its 150 million budget . At the same point in its run , Tangled had earned 115 million en route to a 200 million finish and that film is a perfect comparison since it also opened wide over Thanksgiving weekend . If Frozen maintains its current pace , it will hit 285 million domestically . With no new family films on the horizon , it will be the top family choice over the upcoming holiday break .
