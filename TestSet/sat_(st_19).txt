Malice Percival ( a pseudonym ) is a 26 year old short order cook originally from Philadelphia . He explains the impact the Cambridge study had on the homicide community " When that data came in we were all completely shell shocked . It was a bombshell for us . Now we knew there was a state out there where we can commit our murders , and yet have the reasonable expectation of living in comfort for the rest of our remaining lives if caught . It was a gamechanger for me . I moved out here to Fargo four days later . "
