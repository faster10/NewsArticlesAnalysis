From an employee perspective , " This is good news , " says Lamprey . " We expect staff satisfaction scores to skyrocket . " Nurses , for instance are required by law to have a break during a twelve hour shift and now that they won ' t be eating , they will be urged to quietly meditate and pray for the duration of their twenty minute lunch . Meditation is known to calm the spirit and soothe the soul . And , other staff members in environmental services , maintenance , police , and clerical will only be required to work half days freeing them up to enjoy an expanded personal life .
