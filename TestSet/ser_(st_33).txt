Kelly Landen , EWB program manager , says that in a human dominated landscape , corridors provide safe passage for wildlife to access valuable resources like food and water . " If corridors aren ' t provided for or are blocked , then the wildlife will do what they must to get to those vital resources , as their survival depends on it even if it means having to forge through villages , homesteads and farms . And that creates human and wildlife conflict , in which both people and the wildlife suffer . "
