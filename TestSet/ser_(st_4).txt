This is DiCaprio s fourth Best Actor nomination and with tales of him sleeping in animal carcasses and eating raw liver to make The Revenant , we must hope he wins , or god knows what he will do next . An Oscar nomination can be a career changing moment for any actor , filmmaker or crew member , and whether it s your first nomination ( Brie Larson ) or your 50th ( John Williams seriously , he has 50 Oscar nominations ) , it s always a special moment .
