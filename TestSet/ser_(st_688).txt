The official reason given by the administration was that the public option simply did not have enough Congressional support . Even though the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress , the Obama administration argued that the public option had to be taken off the table , citing the 60 votes in the Senate needed to overcome a Republican filibuster . The ruse was up after the Democrats decided to pass the final bill through reconciliation ? a process that ? required only a simple majority of 51 votes , the number of public option supporters the Democrats had continually asserted they had . Reconciliation effectively bypassed the Republican threat of filibuster , and even though a clear majority of voters in the Congressional districts of progressive Democrats supported using the reconciliation process to ensure passage of the public option , Congress still refused to include the measure in the final legislation due to the pressure being placed on them by the Obama administration to exclude it .
