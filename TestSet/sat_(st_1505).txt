" It ' s outrageous the amount of hate and bigotry that ' s allowed to be freely posted on Facebook and other social media outlets without any legal consequences , " said Sharpton . " This isn ' t just about me , and it isn ' t just symbolic .

Facebook has overstepped the line of free speech , entering into the territory of hate speech , by looking the other way for far too long . "
