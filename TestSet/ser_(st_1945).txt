6 . Sylvester Stallone seemed genuinely touched by his Best Supporting Actor win . I m going to try not to get emotional , he said as he took to the stage after a standing ovation . Last time I was here was 1977 and the view is so beautiful now . He concluded his speech by saying : Most of all , I want to thank my imaginary friend Rocky Balboa for being the best friend I ever had . However , many viewers were disappointed Stallone didn t thank his co star Michael B Jordan and Creed director Ryan Coogler , but apparently he rushed back on stage and did , although it didn t make it on to TV .
