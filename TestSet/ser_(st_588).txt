The overwhelming majority of the people pouring into streets of Tehran and other major cities in support of Moussavi are precisely these 15 to 29 year olds . How could this then be a middle class uprising if the overwhelming majority of those who are supporting it and putting their lives on the line are in fact jobless 15 to 29 year olds who still live with their parents who cannot even afford to rent an apartment , let alone marry and raise a family and join the middle class in a principally oil based economy that is not labor intensive to begin with ?
