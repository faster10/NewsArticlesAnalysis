" LeanSpa was an excellent company with first rank scientific advisors and an excellent , clinically tested weight loss product . It did not mislead consumers in its product claims or billing practices , and was itself a victim of deceptive and fraudulent conduct by its marketing partners . The settlement is a pragmatic compromise which admits no wrongdoing by LeanSpa and Mr Mizhen and spares them expensive , protracted litigation . Could they have had their day in court , they are confident they and their actions would have been wholly vindicated . "
