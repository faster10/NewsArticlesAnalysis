The biggest difference between the two town halls was the focus on issues of personality . ? Clinton s likability , as a person , was put more front and center with questions about why young women supposedly don t like her or her long history of dealing with extremely personalized right wing attacks or , in the strangest question of the evening , how she can balance the ego necessary to be a politician with the religious duty to humility . ? In many cases , the questions were well intended , but it s hard not to shake that creeping feeling that the focus on personality says more about the double standards women are held to in politics rather than anything Clinton herself , whose personal style would be utterly unremarkable if she were a male politician .
