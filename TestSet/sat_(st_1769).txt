The other agent explained how ICE picks the families . " We search all sorts of records and profile these families on a case by case basis . They need to earn around 80 , 000 per year , per kid , and they need to budget well and be financially sound . They also need to clear stringent background checks , and they need to have kids of their own , in public schools , so we can see how their records look , too . We want these kids going into good homes . "
