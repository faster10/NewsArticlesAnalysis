" The other day , I nearly lost it when I saw a state trooper pull up behind me on the highway , " said the troubled Stewart , who said he must have been doing at least 10 over the 55 mph speed zone . " When another cop , and yet another , and then an ambulance all whizzed past me , I thought I was either hallucinating or that my time had come , and I would have crashed my car into the divider to put an end to all this torment , but just in time to stop myself I noticed a burning car on the shoulder and another in the ditch . I suppose that that gave me a reason to go on , but I know that someone ' s got it in for me . "
