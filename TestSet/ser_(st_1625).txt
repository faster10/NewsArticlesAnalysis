Goodacre : There are no ancient texts in which Jesus had a wife . The closest we get to the idea is the Gospel of Philip in which Mary Magdalene is described as Jesus ' " companion , " one of three women who always " walked with the Lord . " The same Gospel says that Jesus used to kiss her often , but we don ' t know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point ! However , the Gospel of Philip is probably too late ( late second to mid third century ) to be able to tell us anything reliable about the historical Mary Magdalene .
