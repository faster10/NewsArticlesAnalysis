Fitzsimmons says he ' ll use the settlement to catch up on " Game of Thrones , " a show he and his wife had watched prior to their DVR encountering its technical issues . " I ' ll miss watching this show with my wife . But I believe , deep down , she ' ll be sitting on the couch beside me when Daenerys crosses the Narrow Sea to conquer Westeros . Thank you , Time Warner Cable . Thank you for making this right by my family . "
