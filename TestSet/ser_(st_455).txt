The wildland firefighters who work for Grayback Forestry in Medford , Oregon , have no such motivational adages because their job is actually digging ditches . Around active forest fires . On the sides of mountains . You can ' t even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older , because they ' re all private sector contractors . Which means if they aren ' t out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods ( basically extreme landscaping ) , they are losing money . They are the hardest working men in the tree business .
