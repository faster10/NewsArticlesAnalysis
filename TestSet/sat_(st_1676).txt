Joshua Lancaster , a veteran social worker within the Department of Maryland Protective Services , told CNN correspondent Lisa Cornia , during a brief interview , " It is not uncommon for a parent to filter themselves from a discipline standpoint while in public , if this is how Ms . Graham disciplines her son in public , it ' s important we gain an understanding of how she disciplines her children behind closed doors . It can be stressful for a single mom of 6 and our job is to worry about the well being of those 6 children , we are and always will be the advocate for the children . "
