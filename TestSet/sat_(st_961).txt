The results were surprising . Of the 850 patients who texted on their cell phone , all 850 were either discharged from the ED or admitted for 24 hours or less without a remotely serious medical or surgical condition being diagnosed . Among the 4150 controls who did not text on their cell phone , 18 . 4 ( 95 CI 14 . 5 21 . 2 , p 0 . 05 ) ended up being admitted for more than 24 hours and 14 . 2 ( 95 CI 13 . 1 15 . 0 , p 0 . 05 ) were diagnosed with a condition defined as " very serious or life threatening .
