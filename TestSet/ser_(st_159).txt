That was not pre planned . It was a spontaneous reaction . Sometimes you want to tell somebody something man to man , it s better than telling them via text or even a handwritten letter , or seeing them at a banquet and saying , Boy , it sure was great playing against you , ' " Manning said . " I told ( Tom ) Brady the same thing previous to telling Belichick . I understand there s people ( nearby ) but what I said was true . This could be it . I m aware this could be it and I wanted to tell both of them I really have enjoyed these games . It s been part of my football life and both of those guys have been part of good for me and not so good for me and so I took the time to tell them .
