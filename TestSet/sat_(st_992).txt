The problem with the future is that it ' s not in the present . You might hear about how the savvy healthcare practitioner maxes out their retirement plans . YAWN . What if you ' re too old and decrepit to enjoy your money ? Live in the present ! Buy fancy status symbols that rapidly depreciate like big mansions ( with 9 bathrooms and 14 basements ) , fancy cars ( especially limited edition gold Lamborghinis ) , and yachts ( even if you live in a landlocked state like Georgia ) . Live large because you could be poor at any moment ! Some of you might be asking , " What about the employer match ? Well , ask your employer to match your bitchin ' gold chains ! !
