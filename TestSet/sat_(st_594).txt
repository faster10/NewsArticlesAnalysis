" In keeping with traditional Native American economics , there will be a trading system which will allow them to catch a glimpse of the remnants of their museum , which are now stuffed into a storage locker in the museum ' s basement , " he said . " For example , they can trade us five acres of their land for a five minute glimpse , ten acres for a six minute glimpse , 20 acres for a six and a half minute glimpse , et cetera . It ' s all very customary . "
