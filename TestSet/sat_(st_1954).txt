The band ' s name partially comes from the stoned stupor effect that the band ' s mesmerizing music has on concert goers . Phil Lesh ' s structureless bass meanderings directed the silhouetted guitar noodlings of Garcia and Bob Weir over rattling drums and clunky keyboard runs . No one in attendance could figure the band out , partially because of the formless noise , but mostly because acid addled brains simply cannot form complete thoughts . Being under the influence of such a mind altering drug naturally reduces a person ' s inhibitions toward sexual filth and the use of other intoxicants .
