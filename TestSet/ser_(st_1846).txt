The two regions the FN could win are Nord Pas de Calais Picardie , where Marine Le Pen , won 40 . 5 of the vote , and Provence Alpes C ? te d Azur , where her niece , Marion Mar chal Le Pen , gained 40 . 6 . The Socialists are expected to drop out of both races . However , this will probably not change the expected outcome , as nearly all non FN voters in the first round would need to turn out again and vote for Sarkozy s candidate . This is unlikely .
