The ship , made of Lebanese cedar coated with pitch , is of truly gigantic dimensions . It reaches slightly over 125 meters in length , 21 meters in width and just under 13 meters in height . These dimensions are astonishingly close to the dimensions of the Ark as described in the Genesis , which are given as 300 cubits by 50 by 30 ( which converted in the metric system would translate as 137 . 16m long by 22 . 86m wide by 13 . 716m high ) . The ark had three internal decks , a door in the side , and a skylight . It is by far the biggest and most complex ship ever found from that time period , and is even the biggest wooden ever recorded , forcing a complete redefinition of the known history of shipbuilding .
