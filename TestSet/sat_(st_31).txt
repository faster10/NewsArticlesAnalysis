" This is one of the most extreme case of amnesia and memory disorders that I have ever heard about " says Dr Mackenzie . " It ' s impossible to tell if he will regain his past memories , and if his " new " memories will disappear . This is a really unique case , as people with Foreign Language Syndrome usually learn a language they had previously been exposed to , so it ' s really hard to predict what could happen in Mr Miller ' s case .
