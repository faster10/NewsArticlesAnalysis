As a testament to the desire for a video to be produced , with or without Hussein ' s consent , an unauthorized video has surfaced , showing an animated Hussein at the height of his power making a speech to the citizens of Iraq . The speech was overdubbed with the sounds , " Moch ma moch mahw owfph a mock ma ma ma mawww mah mah , " imitating the voices of the adults from the loveable " Peanuts " cartoons . The caption at the bottom of the screen read in Arabic and English , " Does it really matter what they say ? Never trust a dictator . "
