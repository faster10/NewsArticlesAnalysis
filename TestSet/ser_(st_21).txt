Lot of good kids there I really care for and wish them the best , Chavis continued , but not on this day . The Aggies exited the Big 12 three years ago ? and are still angling for that first victory against new rival LSU . The only thing I can tell you is that I enjoyed coaching this team , and I am very proud , said Miles . That s how we think of it . That s how this team thinks of it . We wouldn t want anyone else here . There s some work to do there . If not , then the program is going to get worse before it gets better , and considering the impatience of the boosters , they are not going to like that either .
