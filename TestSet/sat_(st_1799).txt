I have concluded through my years of experience that , aside from the rejection of Jesus , the lure of jamband music is due to drugs . And with every discovery of a teenager curled up in fetal position , I ' ve found jamband music being listened to at high decibel on a stereo or bing device . The subject is usually under the influence of narcotics and masturbation . One does not just wander off the straight and narrow to the lure of jamband music without first introducing drugs and self rape .
