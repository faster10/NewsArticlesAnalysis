Classy fix : Use a carrot , not a stick , to drum up support . Set up a Kickstarter campaign with a low funding limit and offer incentives for different contributions . Send kind , flattering , personalized appeals to different potential donors ( " I thought this might interest you since you ' re familiar with startup nonprofits , and I ' d love to take you out for coffee and benefit from your wisdom even if a financial contribution isn ' t possible right now " ) and leave them alone if one followup note goes unanswered .
