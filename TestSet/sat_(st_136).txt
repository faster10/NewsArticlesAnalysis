" We opened an investigation about this case in October after we were informed that the suspect may have been sexually abusing corpses , " Police Chief Fort told reporters . " We accumulated enough evidence over the last few months to obtain a warrant for a paternity test on her newborn son . It confirmed our suspicions , that the father of her child was , indeed , a 57 year old veterinarian from Texas who was driving through the county when he had a fatal car accident . All the evidence that we have gathered suggests that he had never met Ms . Burrows before his demise and that he was already dead when the baby was conceived . "
