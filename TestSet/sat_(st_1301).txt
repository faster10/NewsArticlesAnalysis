" You have to practice . I mean , you have to , " said Dr Ivanovich . " It ' s how you get good . You play like you practice and I practice like a champion . No person on this earth could go off on as many people as I do without practice . Think about all the people I have to scream at in a regular day : scrub nurses , medicine residents , my own residents , absolutely everyone in the ER . It ' s exhausting , taxing even , like a marathon . But , boy , can I flip my expletive like a champ . Sometimes I even impress myself ! "
