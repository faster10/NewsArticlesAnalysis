Go not just to Pakistan , where I met many of the million strong Malala demonstrators demanding a girl ' s right to school . Travel to Bangladesh and you ' ll find girls who have created ' child marriage free zones ' , preventing themselves being kept from school in a loveless marriage they did not choose . Visit Nepal , where girls are fighting child slavery with the Common Forum for Kalmal Hari Freedom . Attend the marches in India led by child labourers , demanding not just an end to this form of slavery , but the delivery of their right to learn .
