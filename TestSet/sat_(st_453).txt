" My first reaction was to make a blood oath to the destruction of America and all that it stands for when Marines frivolously killed my sons for no apparent reason , " said Ahmed Zaranj , whose children were mowed down by Marine gunfire in a search for weapons of mass destruction supposedly hid in their pantry . " Then I thought more about it , and just realized that these poor soldiers were under duress and didn ' t mean it as a personal attack . War is ugly , and sometimes the only way to learn that lesson is to see it up close and personal . I ' m quite grateful for such an important life lesson so close to my heart . "
