It happened that as a student journalist working at the university television and radio station , I ended up covering the trial . I was among those allowed to view the crime scene photos that were entered into evidence . I have never been able to get those scenes out of my head . The worst : a picture of a victim ' s body on a bed with her severed head staring down from a bookshelf . It is the stuff of nightmares . They were haunting , purposely theatrical photos that were pornographic in nature due to the positioning of the bodies . All of them seemed to be scenes from a horror film too gruesome to make .
