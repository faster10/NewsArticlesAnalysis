The occupiers are actually forging a robust micro society of working groups , each one developing new approaches or reviving old approaches to long running problems . In just one example , Occupy ' s General Assembly is a new , highly flexible approach to group discussion and consensus building . Unlike parliamentary rules that promote debate , difference and decision , the General Assembly forges consensus by " stacking " ideas and objections much in the fashion that computer programmers " stack " features . The whole thing is orchestrated through simple hand gestures ( think commodities exchange ) . Elements in the stack are prioritized , and everyone gets a chance to speak . Even after votes , exceptions and objections are incorporated as amendments .
