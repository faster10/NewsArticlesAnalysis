" Nothing but respect to the soldiers coming home from the war , " he said . " As far as something I can tell them to do , this might sound cold , but don ' t expect anybody to care . Don ' t expect that because you ' re a GI , you ' re going to come home and somebody ' s going to open up their hands up to you . You just gonna have to bust your a from the ground up , unfortunately . "
