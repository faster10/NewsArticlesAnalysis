In the first half of the game , the Steelers were less than spectacular on offense . As Jones struggled , so did the rest of the offense . Coming into the game as the starter didn t give Jones the same comfort he exhibited in the Week 6 win over the Arizona Cardinals . It wasn t until the Steelers had cut the Chiefs lead to 16 13 early in the final quarter , via a pass to Martavis Bryant , that the game became truly interesting . On a 19 yard corner slant , Bryant snatched the ball , bobbled it and then steadied it in time to get both feet in bounds for the only Pittsburgh touchdown . Jones completed just 16 of 29 passes for 209 yards . His two interceptions and sack fumble sealed the deal . Antonio Brown was held to just six receptions for 124 yards , but a tipped pass to him ended up in the hands of a Chiefs defender . Le Veon Bell rushed for 121 yards on 17 carries as the Steelers played conservatively , for the most part , keeping the running game their mainstay for offensive production .
