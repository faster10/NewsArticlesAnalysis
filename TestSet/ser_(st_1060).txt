He survived for 36 hours on floating food and stayed awake by drinking caffeinated beverages until rescuers found him . If he had fallen asleep , he would have drowned . Incidentally , Giampedroni was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a plea bargain for his role in the deaths for not being at his duty station to help evacuate the ship .
