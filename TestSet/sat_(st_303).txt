Though artists risk irrelevance by standing by a controversial anti war message , many have come out in support of each other . Said U2 ' s outspoken front man Bono : " Everyone knows that if you want to sell songs , avoid such heavy topics as world hunger , civil rights or persecuted minorities . Since the beginning of rock and roll , songs that would have been classics like Buffalo Springfield ' s ' For What It ' s Worth ' , or the Youngblood ' s ' Let ' s Get Together ' have reveled in obscurity , enjoyed only by those really willing to seek out a contentious message in music . Those same barriers exist now , and artists that dissent from the Bush agenda risk being chased out of the mainstream and ignored by their peers . "
