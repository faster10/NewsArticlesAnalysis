So I wrote the show with all of that in mind , knowing I would have all this technology available this great room , the acoustics and this giant stage and everything like that . So I almost shot it more like a music video , all of my more iconic music videos or images , and based it from there . I wanted to bring those more alive , so I used that as the influence in regards to the fashion and the look of things . I want it to be familiar to people as well . I want them to reminisce , but I wanted them to see things in a more refreshed , contemporary way .
