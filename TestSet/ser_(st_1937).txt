( On how much of a difference Patrick Lewis made when he took the starting job at center : ) Patrick did a nice job . He really did . He did a solid job for us all throughout . That changed kind of accompanied the time when we got better , we all recognized that . I think just his comfort with the spot helped us . We didn t need him to be the best center in the NFL , we needed him to be a solid guy . He contributed to it and became a very good part of it .
