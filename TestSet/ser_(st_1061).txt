All that was in the Concordia the moment it wrecked is presumably still there , save the ship ' s bell , which mysteriously disappeared two months after the wreck based on surveillance video taken by authorized divers . An investigation into who could have stolen the bell has caused some concern that other items , especially high price items from the ship ' s gift shops , could have also been pilfered . Everything inside the ship is expected to be recovered and returned to its original owners , no matter how water logged it may be , but that could be months from now when the ship is eventually towed and dry docked for dismantling .
