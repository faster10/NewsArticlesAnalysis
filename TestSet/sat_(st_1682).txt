Christie is scheduled to resume his campaign activity on Thursday . One campaign advisor told us that they ' ll be taking his health into consideration , though . " At least through July , we aren ' t going to really run ' for President . We don ' t want anything like this to happen again . So we ' ll probably walk ' for president , and then maybe stop off and take a few breaks to catch our breath , just to be safe . But just wait until November or December we ' ll be able to really run ' for president by then , and when that day comes , America better watch out ! "
