Prime Minister Justin Trudeau : ? Oh , this is a beginning . This is something that we want to get done right and quickly to show Canada is engaging . And of course as we are able to welcome in more and give them pathways to success . I mean this not just about welcoming 25 , 000 refugees , it ' s welcoming in 25 , 000 new Canadians , and doing that the right way , and doing that on an ongoing basis is important for our country . But it ' s also important to show the world ' cause we know over the coming decades with climate change , with further conflicts and resource depletion , there are going to be more and more refugees around the world . And to demonstrate that there are ways of making refugees a positive for the country , as Canada has done historically , ? but we can do it in a positive , productive helpful way now is a really important message .
