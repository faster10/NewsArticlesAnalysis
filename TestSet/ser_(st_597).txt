The day we saw the Braves play the Phillies , I also learned that the beauty of preseason play is that it creates a home away from home for fans from afar . Concession stands offered Philly Cheese Steaks , knishes and P shaped pretzels . At the bar , strangers swapped profanity laced travel tips . In " tiki bar " outfield seating , fans sat on bar stools behind long tables , raising bottles of Coors Light in the direction of players passing by . Others of a more inebriated nature demanded that Antonio Bastardo sign a beer bucket or have his " ass kicked " and needled sports anchor Gregg Murphy with taunting , prolonged cries of " MURPH ! " Fans rooted for the home team and made fun of the Braves .
