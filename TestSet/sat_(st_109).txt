One ancient Irish literary myth tells of an Irish chieftain , Tuathal , who spent some time in Britain early in the present era and returned with an army to seize power in the Irish Midlands . The myth of Tuathal also connects him to a number of Irish places , some of which have been excavated and have produced Roman material of the late 1st or early 2nd centuries AD . Indeed , the sparse inland distribution of the early Roman material matches Tuathal ' s " mythical " campaign remarkably well .
