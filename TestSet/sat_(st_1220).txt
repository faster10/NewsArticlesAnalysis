" So I called General Surgery to let them know about a possible chole . Once some data started coming back it was just as I expected the patient ' s vitamin D levels were shockingly low , so I ordered some stat PO repletion with a large meal washed down with a generous carton of chocolate milk for extra calcium I thought the surgical resident would appreciate me taking care of that for him before he made it down . Then I thought about some of the complications of surgery , and called Hepatobiliary just in case there was an anatomic misadventure in the biliary tree , and Vascular in case an errant trocar punched through some valuable real estate , and Plastics for the inevitable poor wound healing . You know , just to make them aware . "
