The mystique of masculinity , for example , encourages many men to view studying hard as " a girl thing . " It also leads many to seek work in the unstable , seasonal construction sector or in other " manly " jobs , many of which are concentrated in declining industries , rather than preparing themselves for " traditionally female " jobs in health care , child care , teaching , and social work . " Manly " males bully other males who show interest in such work , accusing them of acting " gay " or being " girlie men . " And when men defy these stereotypes to seek such work , they often encounter gender discrimination from employers who believe that a man cannot be as good a nurturer or helper as a woman .
