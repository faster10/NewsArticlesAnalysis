The surgery faculty , however , were even less sanguine . One surgery faculty screamed : " Yet another administrative move that shows how out of touch our leaders are with medical education . What do they think 3rd year students do all day long ? Coding ! That ' s what . Now they get to sit in a classroom and sleep in their own beds every night just so that they can learn how to do something they have already been doing . Meaning I will have to do it myself . Administrative BS , that ' s what this is ! I may as well go into private practice . "
