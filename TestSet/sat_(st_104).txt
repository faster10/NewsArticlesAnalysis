Searches for Noah ' s Ark , sometimes mockingly referred to as arkeology , have been made from at least the time of Eusebius ( c . 275 339 AD ) to the present day , and many scholars and archaeologists have claimed to have discovered it in the past . In June 2006 , Bob Cornuke of the Bible Archeology Search and Exploration Institute ( or BASE Institute ) took a team of 14 American " business , law , and ministry leaders " to Iran to visit a site in the Alborz Mountains , purported to be a possible resting place of the Ark . The team claimed to have visited an " object " 13 , 000 feet above sea level , which had the appearance of blackened petrified wooden beams , and was " about the size of a small aircraft carrier " 120 m , and supposedly consistent with the dimensions provided in Genesis of 300 cubits by 50 cubits . No one outside the expedition has offered independent confirmation however , and apart from a few purported beams , no photographic images of this supposed Ark in its entirety have been made available .
