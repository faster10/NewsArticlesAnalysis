" I did not self afflict my gunshot wound , " said Zimmerman , according to a local reporter camped outside his temporary home . " The man who shot his gun at me has held a grudge for a very long time and the harassment is ongoing . He follows me for no reason . I filed many police reports against him that state on the record the official facts that will back up what I say as a true version of events to the fullest extent of the law . "
