These activists put this approach into practice , for example at the Brixton mosque in south London , by developing initiatives in the community to engage young people in discussions of foreign policy , identity and the meaning of religious terms like jihad , in order to counter those who advocate violence against fellow citizens .

In what must seem a paradox to backers of East German levels of surveillance like Peter King , more radical talk might be the best way of reducing terrorist violence .
