Our drop zone was somewhere near the El Salvador border . We humped 20 clicks into the sweltering jungle toward our destination . As one of the point men for forward reconnaissance , my job was to advance and encircle the objective , a forward Sandinista camp near the border where commie assaults were launched against our transport lines . I , being an explosive demolition and ordnance expert , secretly placed M18 Claymore mines at the main entrances and took a position near the rear of the camp to prevent enemy retreat or flanking maneuvers . Naturally , I had placed more claymores near a small escape gate .
