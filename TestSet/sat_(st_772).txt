For us and them . " He toggles through his pages , shaking his head in disbelief . " Wow , it must be a full moon tonight : three back massages , one tight iliotibial band , and a foot massage . " His pager goes off one more time his eyes widen . " Oh man , that foot massage is emergent ! I gotta go take care of this this ICU nurse has been on her feet for twelve straight hours ! ! That ain ' t right ! If I don ' t get there fast , her feet may very well fall off and we CANNOT have that . "
