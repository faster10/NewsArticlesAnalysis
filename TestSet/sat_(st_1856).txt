" Look , I ' m too busy to stop all the gun violence in America , " God told reporters and added , " try some new laws . " Some in the press pool asked if gun laws can really prevent or stop all murder , and God dismissed those questions as " irrelevant " because according to God , " you don ' t write laws to try and stop a human behavior cold " but rather he said , " you write laws to punish people for breaking rules society has deemed necessary and you write laws to hopefully deter others once they see the punishment for breaking the laws . " He further reiterated his point by saying that " laws are only supposed to reduce the bad or unacceptable behavior , not stop them from ever happening . "
