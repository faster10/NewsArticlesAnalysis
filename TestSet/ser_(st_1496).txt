While there s a strong appeal to the idea of a candidate who just knows what the right thing to do is and does it every time , that s also a fantasy , and one with a dark underbelly that rarely gets talked about .

Being able to listen and learn and change and grow is something we should want in a politician , who is , after all , supposed to represent our views in Washington , not just impose his or her own by fiat .
