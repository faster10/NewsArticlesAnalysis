For Vogel and George and the rest of the league , really it s not small vs . big . It s versatility vs . rigidity . If the Warriors have been instructive of anything , it s that they can beat you any which way : big or small , fast or slow , in isolation or with motion . They can protect the rim with one of the three best defensive centers in the game , or can bench him in favor of the most dynamic center in the game . The Spurs and Heat championship teams displayed similar flexibility with lineups that could shrink or expand without compromising their best players core assets .
