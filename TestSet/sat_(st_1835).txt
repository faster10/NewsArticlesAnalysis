Meanwhile , Apperson ' s lawyer , Mark NeJame , says his client was only acting in self defense , and fired his gun only after Zimmerman waved a gun at him . " I didn ' t wave my gun at him , I waved my hand at him , " said Zimmerman . It was unclear whether or not a gun was in Zimmerman ' s hand at the time of the alleged waving . " I wanted to make peace , " explained Zimmerman , " because that ' s what peace officers do , we make peace , unlike the portrayals I have been seeing of me in the press for the last few years unfortunately . " Two guns , including a . 357 Magnum revolver , were recovered from Apperson ' s vehicle . The . 357 had one spent shell casing in the cylinder . Also recovered was one handgun from Zimmerman .
