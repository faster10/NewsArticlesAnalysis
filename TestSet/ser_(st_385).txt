Then there was the fun part of picking the director and giving them all my ideas , my wish list , and asking them all , " Which ones do you think you can realize , and how would you make them happen ? " And then the spine of the show was the song list . I want people to hear the songs they know . I want people to hear the hits and I want them to be satisfied in that regard . It always disappoints me when I go to a concert and they don ' t play my favorite song , or at least one of their biggest hits . That process , for me , even without being the performer , was a fantastic experience , and really the big reason why I didn ' t plunge into the record right away . I needed that year just to write the show , to create it and build it .
