SS : I m talking about double standards , while we re fighting ISIS , okay , and double standard meaning , you know , how can you fight ISIS if you re backing people who are arming them . Double standard meaning ignoring your warning , when you were back in office in 2012 about the rise of ISIS , and , maybe , even , you know , think that it s a willful decision to ignore your warnings about rise of ISIS . Is this not double standards ?
