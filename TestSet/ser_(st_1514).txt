It is not just that the police do not want to act . As demonstrated by the sheer buffoonery of the investigation carried out by Hilton Botha the investigating officer in the Oscar Pistorius case and himself facing seven charges of murder for shooting at a taxi with seven passengers in it our police services are terrible at investigation . Out of 65 , 000 sexual offences reported every year in South Africa in recent times , the police are fortunate to record more than 4 , 000 convictions . It is almost just not worth reporting the crime .
