And as if It ' s not hard enough with all these medical barriers , add on the lights and cameras . I get nervous and sweaty just thinking about it . I mean , CNN , NBC , FOX are always talking about me behind my back Yeah , you , sir . Do you mind turning the flash off on your camera ? It ' s a bit distracting , thank you It ' s a big adjustment , always hearing your name on TV and being portrayed in such a heartless manner , granted it ' s mostly true . It makes me sad and hurts my feelings .
