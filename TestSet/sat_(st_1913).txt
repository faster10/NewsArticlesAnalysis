" I shouldn ' t need to justify why this bill is necessary to anyone , not after seeing what they were dressed like , " says the bill ' s author , Congressman Richard Head ( R UT ) . " Did you see the photos from the march ? The First Daughters looked like pole dancers . You could clearly see their knees and even an inch or two of their thighs . And one of them was wearing go go dancer boots . Is this the sort of message we want to send to the rest of the world ? Is this how we want the First Family to represent America and our values ? I think not . "
