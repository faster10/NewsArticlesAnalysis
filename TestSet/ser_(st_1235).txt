" My feelings about attachment and partnership have always been that they are fluid and evolving , " Bello writes in the New York Times . " Jack ' s father , Dan , will always be my partner because we share Jack . Dan is the best father and the most wonderful man I ' ve known . Just because our relationship is nonsexual doesn ' t make him any less of a partner . . . . And Clare will always be my partner because she is also my best friend . "
