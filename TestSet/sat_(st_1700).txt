Charlie Butterston , of Broomfield , runs a dispensary in town that does extremely brisk business . Butterston says he became interested in marijuana retail when he attended Colorado State University in the business program . At the time , the state had yet to legalize sales of the drug for recreational use , but Charlie says he could " see even back then " that ' s where his fellow Coloradans were headed , and he immediately began putting together a business plan and setting aside the money that would eventually become the capital he ' d invest in his retail location that specialized in cannabis and cannabis related products .
