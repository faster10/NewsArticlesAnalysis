I ve been on Cruz since Day One , said Carville , who said the Texas senator first came on his radar after his wife , Republican strategist Mary Matalin , hosted a fundraiser for Cruz about a year ago at their home . I saw the people that were there , people I d never seen before . . . I was fascinated . I saw that these were not typical political people . He s smart , he has a message and he s positioned himself just right in this race . That means putting up a strong showing in the Iowa caucuses , and then cleaning up after the New Hampshire primary , when the race heads down South .
