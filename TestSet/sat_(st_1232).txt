" I don ' t know , " surgery resident Dr Krystian Villanueva privately admitted . " Sarah is already super hot as it is , and it doesn ' t help that she has her scrubs custom tailored to hug her body . Dr Hunter has always been going after the nurses , even more now that he ' s divorced . But he never listens to anyone , not even us residents when it comes to post operative management . All of his NG tubes get removed on post op day three not one . Always . Period ! "
