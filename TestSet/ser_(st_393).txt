The defense was tasked once again to keep the Steelers in the game , but against the Chiefs they saw two opportunities to get the offense back on the field after holding the Chiefs go to waste . Jarvis Jones buried Kansas City deep on a kickoff , but Smith was able to hit Kelce for 26 yards and on the very next play hand off to West , who broke tackle after tackle while racing 36 yards before Ryan Shazier caught up and forced him out of bounds . The inability to stop the big run set up a touchdown to Chris Conley . A trending issue of being unable to effectively cover tight ends continues . Lawrence Timmons and Shazier combined for a sack , Cam Heyward was credited with another . Unfortunately , the Steelers defensive play was mediocre and there was not enough pressure to get Smith off of his game .
