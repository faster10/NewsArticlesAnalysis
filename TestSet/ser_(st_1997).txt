After all of the offense , it nearly was the defense that helped the Giants win . Dominique Rodgers Cromartie drilled receiver Snead with a clean hit as he was catching a pass from Brees . The ball popped in the air and was caught on the fly by Trumaine McBride , who returned the fumble 63 yards to make it 49 42 with 7 : 11 left . That came after Harris caught two straight touchdown passes after being carted off the field in the first half and the Giants erased their second 14 point deficit of the game .
