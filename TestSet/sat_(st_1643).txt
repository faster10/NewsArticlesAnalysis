" It just so simple to me , I took this one thing , did another thing to that first thing , shook it all up in a thermos I ' d brought along for the trip , and lo and behold no more cancer , " Fiorina said . When reporters later asked her for any notes , research or proof of her having cured cancer , she told them , " I won ' t be answering any gotcha questions about this . Rest assured I scaled Mt . Everest . Rest assured I cured cancer . You don ' t need to see proof or evidence of anything as long as you rest assured . "
