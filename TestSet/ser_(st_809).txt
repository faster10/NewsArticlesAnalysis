Pulliam ' s take on it is that the legacy cannot be tarnished because all of the good that that show has done cannot be taken away . The generation of people who have gone to college because of " The Cosby Show " and because of " A Different World , " that cannot be taken away . The generation of people who decided to become doctors and lawyers and have families where they are actively involved in their families and loving their children and raising their children and being present in their lives because of watching " The Cosby Show , " that cannot be taken away .
