As you can see on the replay , Dalton didn ' t give his receiver a chance . Instead of leading Green or allowing him to contest a jump ball with Bethel , Dalton badly underthrew the pass . Bethel did a good job of recovering , turned at the right moment , and had the ball hit him in the hands , outside of Green ' s catch radius . The only reason Green ended up catching the ball out of bounds was because it bounced up and out of Bethel ' s grasp . Dalton was feeling heat from an unblocked Alex Okafor , who was also held on the edge by the play fake and threat of Dalton keeping , but this was a throw he simply needed to make . The book on Dalton has always been that he struggles mightily under duress , and that continues to be the case . He has the league ' s best QBR when unpressured , but when teams get to Dalton with pressure , his QBR falls to 24th among the league ' s 32 qualifying passers .
