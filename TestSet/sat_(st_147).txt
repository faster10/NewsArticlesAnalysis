" The fossils appear to belong to a mother and her baby , but we can ' t really be sure about the gender of the adult specimen , " Professor Murphy told reporters . " We don ' t really know either how the two heads interacted together , so we can only speculate about its social and reproductive behavior . The environment in which we found the fossils suggests it was a sort of nest or lair , located in a marshy environment , but that ' s all we really know for now . We might have to do many tests and analysis before we can obtain more information . "
