Critics of the new rules say that they take away from actual patient care and it forces nurses to be transcriptionists instead of care providers . Daley disagrees , releasing a written statement where she stated , " These people the critics obviously do not work with patients . We want our nurses to provide the highest level of care and that is documentation . The more places nurses document patient information and the more often documentation occurs , the better for everyone . This is becoming the new standard of nursing and is superior to one time documentation . "
