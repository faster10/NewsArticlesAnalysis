One sticking point is the Kurds , excluded from the Saudi meetings now taking place to determine which Syrian opposition figures attend the negotiations . This is a mistake , for the Rojava Kurds are inclusive , and pay considerable attention to the rights of other minorities and Arabs and women . All are given leadership positions in governing bodies and the military . They run ? democratically ? a significant chunk of Syria and have the most effective ground forces against Isis . Turkey is , of course , behind their exclusion , but this is unfair as well as counterproductive . If there is to be a unified non ISIS opposition , it s vital that they not be further excluded , including from the Vienna talks .
