Carson , who has seen his numbers slide in the polls lately , has had a bit of a penchant for comparing things to slavery in the past . Dr Carson has compared the Affordable Care Act Obamacare as it is also known and abortion to slavery . During the speech , and afterward at a press conference , Carson insisted that " all around us are things that look like slavery , if you know how to look for them . " Carson said that he is " no longer surprised " when he finds something new to compare to slavery in his daily life , and Thanksgiving dinner this year was no exception for the neurosurgeon turned politician .
