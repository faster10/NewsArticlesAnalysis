" This is going to make my anthology of obsolete 20th century candies complete , " said 28 year old collector Brock Diggler . " I ' ve managed to get every major candies and most of the minor ones before different flavor , artwork , distributor or name changes were made . I ' ve got some Good ' n ' Plenty before they changed it to Awesome and Shitloads ' some Pixie Sticks which , as we all know , are now simply called Blow ' a handful of the old ' Hershey Kisses ' before they were changed to ' Hershey One Night Stand Sex ' and now the recently antiquated Now Laters . I ' m worth millions ! "
