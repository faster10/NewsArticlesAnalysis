It doesn t matter that the newspaper article doesn t back up Trump s claim that he saw this happen on TV . It doesn t matter that the article mentioned a number of people , and not the thousands and thousands Trump referenced . It doesn t matter that one of the reporters who wrote the article says flat out that it does not support what Trump alleges . This tendentious , goalpost shifting , factually inaccurate debunking of the fact check will more than qualify as truth to people who are motivated enough to believe it . And it let Trump put himself in the position he likes to inhabit : that of the unfairly maligned victim pushing back against his persecutors .
