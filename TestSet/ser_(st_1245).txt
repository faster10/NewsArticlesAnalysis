" I am very grateful for the opportunities provided to me through appearing on ' American Idol , ' " says Phillips . " The value that the fans and the show have given to my career is not lost on me . However , I have not felt that I have been free to conduct my career in a way that I am comfortable with . I look forward to being able to make my own choices about my career and to being able to make great music and play it for my fans . "
