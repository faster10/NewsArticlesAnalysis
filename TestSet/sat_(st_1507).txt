" What would you call an open forum where the President and first lady are compared to savages , with images of racist humor and jokes ? I ' m not even going to dignify some of the postings and derogatory messages aimed at the President , the first lady , myself , and the victims of police brutality across the nation . We have thousands of hate filled messages directly attached to the names of Facebook posters . These types of hate speech must be opposed and they must be stopped . Legal action may be the way to end this once and for all . "
