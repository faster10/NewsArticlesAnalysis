Nurse O ' Donnell , who started at Henry Ford just eleven months ago , asked a unit secretary about the existence of a nurse float pool , as she wanted greater flexibility in her work schedule and greater control of her hours . The secretary jokingly responded , " I know of no swimming pool . " Since then , Nurse O ' Donnell has been fascinated by the idea of a therapeutic swimming pool to help not only nurses cope with increasing demands of their job , but all healthcare providers .
