Green Bay ' s two pronged rushing attack of Eddie Lacy and James Starks has had a fairly even split of carries in both Weeks 1 6 and Weeks 8 12 , but it ' s rarely been an even split on a game to game basis . The difference between the top ball carrier ' s number of carries and the secondary ball carrier ' s number of carries has only been within five in one of Green Bay ' s 11 games this season . ( i . e . If Lacy has 20 carries and Starks has 5 , the difference is 15 . ) For the most part , they ' ve just ridden whoever has the hot hand on that particular day .
