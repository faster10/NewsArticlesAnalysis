OMAHA , NE Dr Rory Holloway , an orthopedic surgeon hailing from Nebraska , recently received the state ' s physician of the year award for the third straight year . Dr Holloway operates chiefly out of Lincoln and specializes chiefly in knees , although he is known to operate on broken bones of all varieties and claims to have performed his wife ' s first breast augmentation . The award is based on post encounter patient polls , which reveal that his average patient is happier than a podiatrist working in a VA .
