Also , the NRDC warns that the pipeline would threaten one of America ' s largest underground sources of fresh water , the 175 , 000 square mile High Plains Aquifer . It provides water to 1 . 9 million people and irrigation for thousands of square miles of farmland throughout eight states . " If there was to be a spill that would contaminate that aquifer , we would be looking at a disaster in terms of livelihoods and ecosystems of the magnitude of the Gulf oil spill , " said the NRDC ' s Susan Casey Lefkowitz .
