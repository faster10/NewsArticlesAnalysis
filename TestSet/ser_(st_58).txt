You don ' t need the Chip Kelly or the returning home narratives to know that McCoy is going to be a major part of Bufalo ' s plans on offense . Over the past four games , McCoy has racked up 93 total touches and he has not seen fewer than 21 in any single game . With talented backup running back Karlos Williams likely to miss another week , you can expect to see a heavy dose of McCoy again in this matchup . The Eagles need to make sure they keep an eye on McCoy out of the backfield , as well . Although he hasn ' t been as featured in the passing game as he was for most of his Eagles tenure , he has had a few big plays in the passing game almost every week .
