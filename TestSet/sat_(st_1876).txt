" Now all of this I would expect from him " , said Ms . Wilson . " But then he starts going on about how he was pushing a few other of the white jurors who were unsure . How he swayed them . He laughed in my face and said he thought the police man was lying , probably guilty , but that it didn ' t matter because no white man should go to jail over something so small as a dead n . And im sorry for using those words but I want you to know what he said , and all the hate behind it . I don ' t know if its justice or not to let that police man go , but for sure no justice was coming from Kent . I just can ' t let it stand quiet . "
