? South Korea decides to retaliate over the nuke test by restarting from Friday anti Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts along its border with the North for the first time in nearly five months . The broadcasts previously drew a furious response from the North and , according to Seoul , touched off an exchange of artillery fire . Seoul turned off its speakers in August after marathon negotiations with the North . Seoul also limits the entry of some South Koreans to an industrial park in North Korea jointly run by the two Koreas , which has been a valuable cash source for the North .
