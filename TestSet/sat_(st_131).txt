The content of the tomb was scattered and badly deteriorated , presumably due to the fact that the site was located beneath the river bed for hundreds of years , until the course of the Onon river changed in the 18th century . The remains of a tall male and sixteen female skeletons were identified among hundreds of gold and silver artefacts and thousands of coins . The women are presumed to have been wives and concubines of the leader , who were killed to accompany the warlord in the afterlife .
