I wonder if that quote would inspire the volunteer office of Barack Obama ' s Houston supporters to remove their Che flag . After it was spotted on the wall in a local news video , Obama ' s campaign , far from a haven for right wing nut jobs , went out of its way to make sure everyone knew that it had nothing to do with the flag and didn ' t approve of its use . If Che were such a hero , why would that be necessary ?
