" I don ' t know what it ' s like being a mayor , " Sheen admitted , " but I did play one on television . And I think if you have any big job whether in acting or politics or whatever you owe it to the people who depend on you to show up to work every day 100 percent focused on the job . I don ' t think Mayor Ford can do that now , and that ' s a problem . Get some help dude . "
