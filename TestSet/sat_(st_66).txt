All three heads have visibly been dipped in tar and boiled for preservation , before being pierced by pikes or spears . According to the various tests and analysis realized on the three heads , two of the skulls have been proven by DNA , to belong to the brothers , John and Simon Fraser , while the third is strongly believed to have belonged to William Wallace . All three men were indeed condemned to being executed in 1305 and 1306 , and many contemporary writers describe how the head of the three men were exposed at the same time atop the London Bridge , starting a tradition of gruesome dissuasion that was to continue for another 355 years . The Bermondsey district was less densely urbanized at the time and it is quite possible that after their period of public exposure , the heads were simply buried near the foundation of the bridge .
