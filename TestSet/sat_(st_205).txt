The event took place around 8 : 00 AM this morning in the January Wabash Memorial Park . According to witnesses , the young girl was swept from the ground after her father tied a bundle of 50 helium balloons that he had just bought , to her wrist . She then rapidly gained altitude in front of her panicked parents , who started screaming and looking around for help . Fortunately , two police officers were nearby and responded to the distress call , arriving on the scene just seconds after the baby took off .
