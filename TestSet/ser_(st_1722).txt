Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney pocketed 42 million during 2011 and 2012 . He did not earn that money from work he accrued it through wealth . His investments garnered him tens of millions while he ran around the country campaigning . And yet Romney paid merely 12 in taxes . By contrast , a cop married to a teacher , each making the median income of around 50 , 000 a year , pays a marginal tax rate of 25 . Even with deductions they are almost certainly paying a greater percentage of their income in taxes than mega millionaire Romney .
