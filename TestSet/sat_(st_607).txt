" I called my mother to tell her I was at the movies , and I ' d call her later , and out of the corner of my eye I saw Peter giving me this look , like I was doing something wrong , " she said in disbelief . " Well excuse me , Mr High And Mighty ! Maybe you ' d just rather have my mother sit around for two hours , wondering and wondering what I was doing at that moment , and when I was going to call her next ! "
