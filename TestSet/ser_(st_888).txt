The main difference between Weeks 1 6 and Weeks 8 12 is that Rodgers has shifted a portion of the passes he threw to each of Randall Cobb , James Jones , Richard Rodgers , his running backs , and all other receivers and redistributed them to Davante Adams , who has been nothing short of terrible . Adams was out for three weeks early in the season so he didn ' t factor heavily into Rodgers ' target distribution , but he ' s been in the lineup and heavy in Rodgers ' rotation over the last five weeks . He even had a 21 target game against the Lions .
