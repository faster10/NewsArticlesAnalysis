Fox Searchlight , more than any other arthouse studio , knows how to platform a release as audiences become engaged with the title , and Searchlight often holds back on expansion when prognosticators assume they ' ll push their movies wider they didn ' t put Alexander Payne ' s last movie , " Sideways , " into more than 1 , 000 theaters until its 15th weekend . We ' ll have to wait and see what the distributor does with " The Descendants , " but they ' ve clearly got a hit on their hands . It should soar well past Clooney ' s last picture , " The Ides of March " ( 39 . 5 million ) and perhaps even past Clooney ' s 2009 Oscar bait , " Up in the Air " ( 83 million ) .
