Carson has retold the story several times in various books , but many following the 2016 presidential race are just hearing about it now for the first time . In his 2011 book America the Beautiful , Carson wrote , " Because of the racial and socioeconomic injustice I felt as a boy , in my anger and frustration I began to retaliate by going after people with baseball bats , rocks , and knives . One day a boy pushed me too far . I told him to back off , but he wouldn ' t quit pestering me . Finally , I pulled out my knife and lunged at him , striking him in the abdomen . He fell back , and for a moment I thought I had killed him , but just then my knife blade fell to the ground . It had hit his belt buckle and snapped in two . "
