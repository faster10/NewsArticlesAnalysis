Jason Rezaian , a Washington Post reporter , was arrested in July 2014 on trumped up charges . Released with him last weekend were Amir Hekmati , an ex Marine arrested in August 2011 while visiting family Saeed Abedini , an Idaho pastor held since 2012 Nosratollah Khosravi , a businessman whose case had not previously been made public ( and who opted to stay behind in Tehran ) and Matthew Trevithick , a Boston University grad student studying Farsi in Tehran until he was picked up and imprisoned recently . Technically Trevithick was not part of the swap .
