Douglaswood is 20 miles West of Atlanta , an area plagued by a lack of jobs in poverty stricken Georgia . The theme park will make use of a patch of wetlands newly zoned for commercial use by the state . " The jobs and economic development that the theme park brings will be a tremendous benefit to Douglaswood and the surrounding area , " said Mayor Russell Hodges . " We ' re also in talks with Hilton Corporation to clear cut and build a hotel and waterpark . "
