It is not just the security professionals who will defeat ISIL and the terrorist groups , Obama said Tuesday during a joint White House news conference with French President Francois Hollande . As Americans , we all have a role in how we respond to the threats . Groups like ISIL cannot defeat us on the battlefield , so they try to terrorize us at home against innocent people and even as we are vigilant , we will not and cannot succumb to fear . Nor can we allow fear to divide us . That is how terrorists win . We cannot give them the victory of how we change going about living our lives .
