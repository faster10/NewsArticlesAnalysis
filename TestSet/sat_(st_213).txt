" We walk here almost every day , but we have never seen anything like this , " says Ms . Wilson . " We could smell the stench from almost a mile away , and we knew that there was something wrong . When we finally found the corpse , we couldn ' t believe our eyes . It ' s really huge and it almost looks like a rotting dinosaur . That ' s not a kind of creature that I ever expected to find in Utah ! "
