" Another fifteen minutes passed without a phone call . Xepneumotep ' s dark skin started to separate and his molten inner core was began to show . He screamed in a bowel shaking roar at the circulator to get pathology on the phone . Circulating nurse Jane said , " Boy that Dark Lord sure has temper on him . I would hate to have been that pathologist . Xepneumotep got very personal . He threatened to bring back his daughter ' s severe asthma , which she had out grown , if he didn ' t get the results back quickly . "
