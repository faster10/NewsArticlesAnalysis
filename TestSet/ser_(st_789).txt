Substantively , it s hard to say there was much new in Thursday s Democratic presidential debate , other than the timing ( a weekday ! ) and the format , which ? with the departure of former Maryland Gov . Martin O Malley ? pit Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton against each other one on one . Both candidates made their core pitches and seemed to be targeting their core constituencies . For Sanders , it s the call for a political revolution against a political system that , he argues , is a playground for corrupt , plutocratic interests and their allies in government . The only way to improve life for the majority of Americans , Sanders believes , is through a radical overhaul of public policy , from single payer health insurance to free college and campaign finance reform .
