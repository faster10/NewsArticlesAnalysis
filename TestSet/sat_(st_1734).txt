Apparently , many people in the district feel that it ' s inappropriate for 11 year olds to wear mesh shirts , black eyeliner and lipstick . Teachers claim it ' s a distraction to the other students , but I ' m always seeing Elementary school kids dressed in what their parents think is cute , why shouldn ' t I be able to do the same ? Worse still , one of my closest friends recently told me that it was " tacky " to " force my subculture on my kids " . As if ! They love their little black clothes ! They don ' t want to have " swag " or be preppies . Each of my boys tell me that they embrace the darker side of life , and don ' t want to change to conform to societies norms .
